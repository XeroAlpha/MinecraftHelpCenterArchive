We are thrilled to announce the Greatest Of All Time (G.O.A.T) update (version 1.17.30.5)! Why do we call this the GOAT update?

We can’t wait to inspire more learning through play!

## 40 person multiplayer 

In this update we have increased the number of players able to play together in a hosted world from 30 players to 40 players.

 

## Photos as Items

Photos can now be saved from a portfolio as an item. Just like other items, you can place the photo in an item frame to be hung on your wall. This makes for a great way to capture, display, and share things from your world. You can also use anvils to rename the photo and they can be added to book and quills and other portfolios. 

 

- To save a picture to your inventory, select the **Save to Inventory** button from the **Portfolio**.
- To add a photo to a **Book and Quill**, select the **Add Photo** button from the **Book and Quill**.

 

## Library Updates

Renamed categories for Starter Worlds, Build Plates, History & Culture, Equity & Inclusion, Literacy & Language. Plus, a new category: **Climate & Sustainability**!

 

## Structure Block Updates

New options to “load” and “save” structures for reusing builds in other places or different worlds. Due to this new functionality, structure blocks have been removed from the creative inventory and are now only available using the /give command (for example: /give @s structure_block).

 

## Bug Fixes

Since the initial release, hotfixes (1.17.31) have been deployed to address the following issues:

- Some Proxy configurations prevent login on Windows
- Client hangs while downloading resources
- Windows disconnects multiplayer sessions when app is minimized
- Non-functional arrows visible while using Code Builder
- Blocks can get stuck in Material Reducer UI
- Can't close the "There was a problem loading this world" screen
- Boards from worlds created in 1.14 aren't editable in 1.17
- Some NPCs appear with incorrect skins for worlds created in 1.14
- Additional crash fixes
