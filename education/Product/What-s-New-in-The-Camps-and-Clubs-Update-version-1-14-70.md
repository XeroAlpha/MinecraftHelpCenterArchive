The Camps and Clubs update has some exciting new additions. With features like upgraded teacher controls and Flipgrid integration, there is plenty to explore. We have even added a new commercial licensing option that allows everyone to buy Minecraft: Education Edition. We can’t wait for you to play! 

 

## Commercial purchase 

All users with a Microsoft 365 account (including camps, clubs, homeschools, and other organizations) can now purchase licenses of Minecraft: Education Edition. See the [First Time Purchase of Minecraft: Education Edition for Commercial](https://aka.ms/MEEFirstCommercialPurchase) article for information on creating a Microsoft 365 account and purchasing licenses. 

 

## Embed a link to Flipgrid in your world 

Create a custom button when assigning a lesson from the Library that links to a Flipgrid topic, Microsoft Forms quiz, or any web tool. This Resource Link button appears on the Pause menu when students create the world. Check out the [Assign or Share Worlds and Lessons](https://aka.ms/MEEShareWorldsLessons) article for more information. 

 

**Example of adding a Flipgrid response as a resource link**

## Launch Minecraft: Education Edition from your LMS  

Minecraft: Education Edition can be launched from inside your organization’s learning management system (LMS) or digital portal. You can even have the LMS open a specific world. Look over [Launch Minecraft: Education Edition from an LMS](https://aka.ms/MEELaunchFromLMS) article for more information.

## Share a link to join multiplayer 

Hosts of a world can now share a link that takes users directly into their world. The sharable link is found in the Multiplayer tab of the Pause menu. Links can be copied and sent via email or posted directly into Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom. For more information on how to share worlds, see the Share a Link to your World article.

## Classroom settings 

Classroom settings are all in one place! Use the new Classroom tab when creating or opening a world to access world settings commonly used in the classroom. See the [Classroom Settings for Minecraft: Education Edition](https://aka.ms/MEEClassroomSettings) article for more information. 

This tab will remain visible for teachers who join a hosted world, giving teachers easy access to classroom management controls that support student gameplay. 

By overwhelming request, the invisibility potion effect has been added to the list of destructive items! This means you can now prevent invisible exploits by disabling “Allow Destructive Items” in Classroom Settings.  

Familiar in-game settings from Bedrock have been added to the Game settings tab.

## World Management  

Common world management tasks including Copy, Export, and Delete have been added to the context menu for worlds in your “My Worlds” view. Select any world in your world list, select Manage, and then choose to Copy, Export, or Delete the world.
