Minecraft Education will experience a brief downtime to perform required maintenance of our servers. This downtime will occur on Friday, August 9th at 10:30PM UTC / Aug 9 at 6:30 PM EDT / Aug 9 at 11:30 PM BST / Aug 10 at 8:30 AM AEST. We estimate the servers will be offline for less than 15 minutes.

During this time sign-in, joining multiplayer sessions and coding will all be unavailable, but anyone already signed in and connected to a world should not experience problems. We apologize for any inconvenience this downtime may cause.
