Lesson Crafter is an educational tool powered by AI that allows educators to generate custom lesson plans for Minecraft Education.  You can create a lesson in any topic and age to fit the needs of your learners. We created Lesson Crafter to support teachers getting started with Minecraft Education or looking for easy-to-teach, curriculum-aligned lessons that engage their students. The tool offers a straightforward way for educators to use generative AI to create practical teaching resources, build confidence with using AI, and onboard to using Minecraft Education in their classrooms.

## How does Lesson Crafter work?

Minecraft Education Lesson Crafter leverages the LLMs (large language models) hosted by Azure OpenAI Studios. Lesson Crafter takes input from the user, reformats in a way that LLM models love, formats the output, and returns it in a manner that allows educators to unlock the power of Minecraft Education in their classroom.

## Is my data being used to train an AI model?

No.  We may review the prompts that you enter, and the content generated to assess the quality of results, but this data is not associated with your account. 

## Is Lesson Crafter available?

Yes! Lesson Crafter is now available in private preview for educators.  The preview enables our team to ensure user safety and security, gather and implement user feedback, and make improvements before we roll out the feature to all users in 2025.

## Do I need to know how to use Minecraft to use Lesson Crafter?

Lessons created by Lesson Crafter take place in a blank, flat world ideal for building, allowing learners to focus on crafting, creativity, and collaboration. You don’t need to spend time learning how to set up a world ahead of time. The generated lesson plan includes launch points to the game client and to assign/share the lesson plan output.

## Are there other resources to teach AI using Minecraft?

Minecraft is a great way to help students understand how AI works, discover its potential impact, and learn how to use AI responsibly. It’s a fun, engaging way to explore complex concepts and model learning with real-world scenarios—and build social-emotional skills that support career readiness and complement AI.  Check out the [AI Literacy with Minecraft](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/discover/ai) page for more information.
