There will be some big changes coming soon to Minecraft Education Code Builder that simplify the coding experience for students, ease the learning and training needed for teachers and make the educational coding progression from block-based coding to text-based coding easier for everyone. In our next major release (planned for July 2025), we will be removing support for Tynker and begin removing support for Python Notebooks. The exact timeline for full removal of Python Notebooks will be informed by your responses to the [Minecraft Education Python Survey](https://aka.ms/pythonnotebooksurvey). We will continue to offer library content, tutorials and custom projects in blocks, JavaScript and Python, but after these changes all coding experiences will use MakeCode.

If you are currently using Tynker or Python Notebooks, we recommend starting to plan for how you can move to MakeCode. This may involve completing your existing Tynker or Python Notebooks projects before July and starting new ones in MakeCode or it may involve moving long running custom projects to MakeCode blocks (from Tynker) or MakeCode Python (from Python Notebooks). It may also include creating backups of any Python Notebook or Tynker projects by saving them outside of Minecraft Education.

We want to make this transition as smooth as possible for you, so please see the FAQ below for more details on timing of the changes as well as how you can contact us with questions, feedback or assistance as you evaluate the impact of these changes for you and your teaching needs.

## **FAQs**

### General Questions

**What is changing and when?**

Tynker and Python Notebooks will be removed from Minecraft Education Code Builder. Tynker will be removed in July 2025 and we will begin the process of removing Python Notebooks in July 2025 with full removal to follow in a later update. MakeCode will become the only coding experience in Minecraft Education and will be the place to continue coding in blocks, JavaScript and Python. Content in the library will be updated to use MakeCode, but existing Tynker and Python Notebook projects and existing library content using Python Notebooks will stop working after the coding editors have been removed.

**How can I learn more about what MakeCode supports?**

You can take a look at MakeCode in Minecraft Education Code Builder today and try blocks, JavaScript or Python. You can learn more about what MakeCode supports by reviewing  their official documentation here: <https://minecraft.makecode.com/reference>

 

### Python Notebook Specific Questions

**How do I back up my project?**

You can copy/paste your Python code directly into your preferred external text editor, IDE, or reference.

Example on a Windows device: Open your favorite text editor. Select the code you wish to keep in your Python Notebooks screen. Click Ctrl-C. Move to your text editor. Press Ctrl-V. Save the text file to a folder on your local device or in the cloud.

**Can I continue using my Python Notebooks code in MakeCode Python?**

You will not be able to run Python Notebook projects in Minecraft Education after it is removed. For any projects that you want to continue using in Minecraft Education after the update, we recommend re-creating that code in MakeCode Python.

The easiest way to do this is to copy/paste your Python code into MakeCode and then update the code to the syntax that MakeCode Python uses. Some of the function and variable names in MakeCode Python and Python Notebooks are different, so while the code will be similar you will most likely need to make some changes.

MakeCode Python has autocomplete for functions and a built-in library to browse, so as you put your code into MakeCode, those features should greatly assist in finding the replacement function.

**How can I provide feedback on Python coding in Minecraft Education?**

You can help us understand how you are using Python in Minecraft Education today or how you would like to use it in the future by completing this survey:  [Minecraft Education Python Survey](https://aka.ms/pythonnotebooksurvey)

**How can I provide feedback on the switch from Python Notebooks to MakeCode Python?**

You can provide feedback or ask questions about the move from Python Notebooks to MakeCode Python in [our forum feedback post here.](https://aka.ms/MCEDUCodingChangesFeedback)

## Tynker Specific Questions

**How do I back up my project?**

You can back up your projects to your Tynker account, by signing into Tynker from the top right of the Tynker window in Minecraft Education.  
  

Once the projects are saved, you can return to them by visiting Tynker’s website here: <https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#/projects/recent/>

**Can I continue using my Tynker code in MakeCode blocks?**

You will not be able to run Tynker projects in Minecraft Education after the July 2025 update. For any projects that you want to continue using in Minecraft Education after the update, we recommend re-creating that code in MakeCode.
