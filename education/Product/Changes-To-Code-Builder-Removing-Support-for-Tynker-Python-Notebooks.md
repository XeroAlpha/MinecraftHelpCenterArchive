There will be some big changes coming soon to Minecraft Education Code Builder that simplify the coding experience for students, ease the learning and training needed for teachers and make the educational coding progression from block-based coding to text-based coding easier for everyone. In our last major release (July 2025), we removed support for Tynker and we're planning to remove support for Python Notebooks. However, Python Notebooks will not be removed before December 2025.

The exact timeline for full removal of Python Notebooks will be informed by your responses to the [Minecraft Education Python Survey](https://aka.ms/pythonnotebooksurvey). We will continue to offer library content, tutorials and custom projects in blocks, JavaScript and Python, but after these changes all coding experiences will use MakeCode.

If you are currently using Python Notebooks, we recommend starting to plan for how you can move to MakeCode. This may involve completing your existing Python Notebooks projects before December and starting new ones in MakeCode or it may involve moving long running custom projects to MakeCode blocks or MakeCode Python (from Python Notebooks). It may also include creating backups of any Python Notebook by saving them outside of Minecraft Education.

We want to make this transition as smooth as possible for you, so please see the FAQ below for more details on timing of the changes as well as how you can contact us with questions, feedback or assistance as you evaluate the impact of these changes for you and your teaching needs.

## **FAQs**

### General Questions

**What is changing and when?**

Python Notebooks will be removed from Minecraft Education Code Builder, but not before December 2025. MakeCode will become the only coding experience in Minecraft Education and will be the place to continue coding in blocks, JavaScript and Python. Content in the library will be updated to use MakeCode, but existing Python Notebook projects and existing library content using Python Notebooks will stop working after the coding editors have been removed.

**How can I learn more about what MakeCode supports?**

You can take a look at MakeCode in Minecraft Education Code Builder today and try blocks, JavaScript or Python. You can learn more about what MakeCode supports by reviewing their official documentation here: <https://minecraft.makecode.com/reference>

 

### Python Notebook Specific Questions

**How do I back up my project?**

You can copy/paste your Python code directly into your preferred external text editor, IDE, or reference.

Example on a Windows device: Open your favorite text editor. Select the code you wish to keep in your Python Notebooks screen. Click Ctrl-C. Move to your text editor. Press Ctrl-V. Save the text file to a folder on your local device or in the cloud.

**Can I continue using my Python Notebooks code in MakeCode Python?**

You will not be able to run Python Notebook projects in Minecraft Education after it is removed. For any projects that you want to continue using in Minecraft Education after the update, we recommend re-creating that code in MakeCode Python.

The easiest way to do this is to copy/paste your Python code into MakeCode and then update the code to the syntax that MakeCode Python uses. Some of the function and variable names in MakeCode Python and Python Notebooks are different, so while the code will be similar you will most likely need to make some changes.

MakeCode Python has autocomplete for functions and a built-in library to browse, so as you put your code into MakeCode, those features should greatly assist in finding the replacement function.

**How can I provide feedback on Python coding in Minecraft Education?**

You can help us understand how you are using Python in Minecraft Education today or how you would like to use it in the future by completing this survey:  [Minecraft Education Python Survey](https://aka.ms/pythonnotebooksurvey)

**How can I provide feedback on the switch from Python Notebooks to MakeCode Python?**

You can provide feedback or ask questions about the move from Python Notebooks to MakeCode Python in [our forum feedback post here.](https://aka.ms/MCEDUCodingChangesFeedback)
