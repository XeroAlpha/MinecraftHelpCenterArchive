## What are the changes and when did they take place?

We are adjusted the price of the Minecraft Education commercial licensing offer on September 4th, 2025 to \$36 per year. This change will take effect on your current expiration date, when your subscription is renewed. 

## Why did these changes take place?

The subscription price increase is necessary to support the development of features for Minecraft Education that meet the evolving needs of our customers, and to align our pricing with Microsoft's general pricing policy. The new price also aligns with Minecraft’s other product offerings, ensuring a consistent and fair pricing strategy across all products

Over the years, we have continually added new product features and content, significantly increasing the value of our offerings. These include the ability to upload and save worlds on OneDrive\*, availability on Chromebooks and mobile devices, advancements to the camera, chemistry, and coding features, more than 50 new worlds and curriculum created with expert partners, and esports programs. Minecraft Education releases biannual product updates that continue to add value year over year.

\*Cloud save is available to all customers who meet the requirements listed in the [Cloud Upload and Download – Minecraft Education](../Game-Features/Cloud-Upload-and-Download.md) article.

## How do I disable auto renew?

If you do not want to auto renew into the new price and instead allow your subscription to end on its current expiration date, follow this [Microsoft Learn guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/renew-your-subscription?view=o365-worldwide).

## If I lost access to Admin Center, how do I regain access?

If you have lost access to your Admin center account (either due to the previous Admin account owner leaving the organization or due to losing access to Multi Factor Authentication) contact [Microsoft Support for Business Users](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/customer-service-phone-numbers-c0389ade-5640-e588-8b0e-28de8afeb3f2) and ask to be escalated to the Data Protection team.

If you have difficulties with this route, you can reach out to [Minecraft Education Support](https://aka.ms/MEE_New_Request) and we can escalate your inquiry to this team. Note that this escalation route will take longer.
