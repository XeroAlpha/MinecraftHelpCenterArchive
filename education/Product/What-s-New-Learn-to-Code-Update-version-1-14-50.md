This update brings a new, login-free coding lesson, just in time for [Hack the Classroom](https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2020/10/help-your-students-grow-future-ready-skills-with-hack-the-classroom-stem-edition/ "https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2020/10/help-your-students-grow-future-ready-skills-with-hack-the-classroom-stem-edition/") in November, and Computer Science Education Week in December! Students can complete a series of fun coding activities that bring two villages together using either block-based coding in MakeCode, or coding in Python using our new, notebook-style interface.

Additional features in this update include new Agent commands in Code Builder for content creators and new content in the Library, including additional CS lessons and a category for Equity and Inclusion curriculum.

Please let us know all about the things you love, as well as challenges you run into by contributing to the Learn to Code Update [feedback thread](https://aka.ms/learn_to_code_feedback). 

### New Hour of Code Lesson

This new coding lesson can be accessed from the in-game Library or with the login-free demo. 

Students will use basic coding concepts to practice equity and inclusion as they bring two villages together with code! Choose between block-based coding in MakeCode or Python-based coding in a new, notebook-style coding interface.

### Notebook-style Coding Interface

A new coding interface (IDE) that teaches Python using a notebook-style layout, alternating between instructions and opportunities to write code.

### Library Updates

New lessons in our Coding FUNdamentals series, Coding FUNdamentals: 3. Travel through time, from the pre-historic era to the far-away future! See dinosaurs, Roman aqueducts, and the Wild West while you learn how to use variables, events, conditionals, and functions. 

Mac and iPad users can now share or assign Library lessons via Google Classroom or email. Windows and Chromebook users can continue to share or assign Library lessons via Teams, Google Classroom, or Mail.

New categories, including one for Equity and Inclusion. Concepts include social justice, identity, and tolerance.

### Code Builder Changes

The Choose your Editor screen has been reordered to: MakeCode, Notebooks, Tynker.

Tynker will soon be adding some new commands for the agent as well as some new blocks for mobs, effects, and events.

MakeCode updates include new items and mobs (like foxes and bees!), new time and Agent blocks, a library for the block definitions, a visual update to the UI and a High Contrast mode. Keep checking back, because they have more new blocks and tutorials coming soon.

### Improved Single Sign-On for Chromebooks

Your school district can link your Google and Microsoft accounts to make single sign-on easier for teachers and students with both accounts. Learn more in our [Chromebook Single Sign-On Guide](https://aka.ms/MEE_Chromebook_SSO).

### Technical Updates

All authentication is now done using https://\*.minecrafteduservices.com. If that domain isn’t allowed, it won’t be possible to sign into Minecraft: Education Edition. You can remove <https://meeservices.azurewebsites.net/> from your allow list as it is no longer used for authentication.

In January 2021, we will be updating our sign-in servers. After this update, you will need to be on **Minecraft: Education Edition** **1.14.0** or newer and **Classroom Mode version 1.80** or newer to sign in.  To continue using Minecraft: Education Edition, please [update to the latest version](https://aka.ms/MEEUpdate) this year.
