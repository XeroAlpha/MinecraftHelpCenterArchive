Welcome to the Minecraft Education Copper, Collaborate & Compete Update! We’ve added a new dedicated server for a bigger and better multiplayer experience, moved all in-game coding to MakeCode and added all the features from the last few Minecraft Bedrock updates - like the copper golem and nautilus plus all the new copper blocks and items!  

## Dedicated Server for Multiplayer

Set up your own multiplayer servers to support higher numbers of students, enable cross-tenant gameplay for build challenges and esports, and improve performance and stability.

The servers can be managed by administrators with an easy-to-use web portal or scripts for managing a larger number of servers. (Server management for teachers is coming soon!)
