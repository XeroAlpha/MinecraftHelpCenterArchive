## What is a Minecraft Education Ambassador and how do I get the badge?

- Minecraft Education Ambassadors are a global community of educators passionate about sharing Minecraft Education with others. 
- You receive the badge [via Credly](https://www.credly.com/org/microsoft-education/badge/minecraft-education-expert) after completing the Minecraft 101 series and formally applying on our [Facebook Community.](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/aka.ms/mceduexpert)

## What are the benefits of becoming a Minecraft Education Ambassador? 

As a Minecraft Education Ambassador, you’ll have a chance to connect and build relationships with some of the most inspiring game-based learning educators and experts from around the world. In addition, Ambassadors gain early access to new features and sign ups for Beta opportunities, receive opportunities to speak, write blogs, attend meetups at conferences, and help answer questions in the [Minecraft Education Teacher's Lounge](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/aka.ms/mceduteacherslounge).

## How does the application process work? 

Applications are reviewed by the end of every month, once you've completed the Minecraft 101 series, you can apply via the Facebook Group application which includes showing evidence of completing the series, a series of short questions and a link to a one-minute video highlighting your interest and experience in Minecraft Education.

## How will I be notified about the status of my application? 

Your application will be reviewed before the end of the month, then you'll receive a Facebook notification and entrance into the Private Group with more information.

## What if my bandwidth or time I can provide for the program changes once I’ve been accepted? 

In this case, email us or send a private message via the Facebook Group so we can discuss and decide together whether this is a good year for you to be part of the program.
