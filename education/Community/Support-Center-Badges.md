In the Minecraft Education Universe, you can earn badges for taking courses on Minecraft in [MS Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/), by applying to join the Minecraft Education Ambassador program, and also for contributing to the Minecraft Education Support Forums. MS Learn badges only show up on MS Learn, and Support Center Badges are granted when you are active in the Support Forums.  You can hover over badges you see in the Support Forums to see the titles of the badges.
