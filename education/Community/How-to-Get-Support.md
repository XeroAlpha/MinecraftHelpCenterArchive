We understand that there are times where you can't find the answer you are looking for and you just need a bit more help.  There are a few ways you can reach out for help from our support team.  But first....

### Ask our AnswerBot!

The easiest way to get an answer to your question is to use our Self Helper tool.  This tool will quickly route you to the best answer to almost all of your questions.

Click on the Help icon on any Community Hub page to get started.

### Search our Knowledge Base

The fastest way to get support is to use the search bar to browse our extensive Knowledge Base for answers to your questions.  We have created articles to answer all of the common questions and issues our community has brought to us over the years.  Using the search bar will also return results from the community, where it's very possible you'll find even more information about the topic you are searching for.

### Post in Support Forums

The **I have a technical problem** forum is monitored by the support team as well as a team of community moderators, so in most cases will be the fastest way to get an answer. Don't forget to search first - often, another educator like yourself has already asked a similar question and you can find the answer faster this way.

### Submit a Support Request

If you are having a more complex problem that requires troubleshooting, or have a question that you just can't get answered by other resources on the Community Hub, submit a ticket to the Support Desk.  You have a few options to do this:

1\) You can find a link to **Submit a Request** at the bottom of any Knowledge Base article page (including this page!)

2\) Click your profile picture at the top of any page in the Community Hub and choose the the [Submit a Request](https://aka.ms/MEE_New_Request) option.  If you don't have a profile, read this article to learn how to [Set up an Account and Profile in the Community Hub](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047556611).
