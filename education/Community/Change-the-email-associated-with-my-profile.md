We understand that there are many scenarios where you want to change the email associated with your Support Center profile.  

The Minecraft Education Support Center profile uses multiple data sources to display all the information on your profile:

- Microsoft authentication services are called to log you into either your school/work account or your personal Microsoft account
- Your newsletter subscription is tracked by our secure email system

Using these services can make the process to change the email associated with your profile tricky.  If you are going to be losing access to the email that you currently use for your profile, it's best to complete these steps as soon as possible.  After losing access to your email, it will be more difficult to complete this process.

**Note:** Your new email will need to be either a work/school email (AAD) or personal Microsoft account.  If you do not have either of these, [make a new personal Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account)

## Create a new profile

To create a new profile in the Microsoft Education Community using your new email, just follow along with the steps in this [Article.](https://aka.ms/Setup_Profile)

If you have any issues, you can contact our support team by selecting **submit a request** at the bottom of this page.
