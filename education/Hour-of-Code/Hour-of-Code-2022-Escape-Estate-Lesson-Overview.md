# Welcome to the Hour of Code 2022: Escape Estate!

***Are you ready to put your computational thinking skills to the test? ***

You have been invited by the rich and famous Dr. Breakowski to try and earn a million emeralds. Use coding and computational thinking to unlock secrets, open trap doors, and reveal hidden clues to escape his mysterious mansion by dawn. Be careful though, because things are not as they seem, and every room contains new puzzles. With three levels of challenges, and coding in blocks or Python, Hour of Code offers a learning pathway for anyone to learn the basics of code. The lesson is available for free in Minecraft: Education Edition at [aka.ms/hourofcode2022](http://aka.ms/hourofcode2022).

## **Lesson Objectives**

Through the Hour of Code 2022: Escape Estate, students will:

- Explore early coding concepts
- Use computational thinking to solve coding puzzles
- Create code (using blocks or Python) to solve problems
- Discover how computational thinking can be applied to other subject areas (outside of computer science)

This year’s Hour of Code has a strong emphasis and focused learning outcomes on computational thinking. Computational thinking is an approach to problem-solving using specific skills and practices.
