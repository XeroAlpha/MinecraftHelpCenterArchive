**Learn the basics of AI systems as you tackle a classic Minecraft challenge – the First Night!**

Building on over a decade of success with the Hour of Code, Minecraft Education is proud to introduce the Hour of AI, a global initiative designed to help students and educators everywhere take their first step into understanding and creating with artificial intelligence (AI).

Try to survive the first night in Minecraft, but this time with the help of AI! Team up with an AI Agent and train it to recognize resources, craft tools, and build shelter before the sun sets. Solve fun coding puzzles as you prepare for darkness with MakeCode blocks or Python. Explore the potential of creative collaboration with AI systems and learn why AI tools require human oversight in this thrilling Hour of AI. 

Hour of AI provides a fun and engaging experience to introduce computer science and AI literacy to students, leveraging the magic of Minecraft to make complex ideas accessible and exciting.

#### **What is Hour of AI?**

- Hour of AI is a new initiative by Code.org, building on a decade of impact with Hour of Code, that seeks to demystify AI for millions of learners worldwide through accessible activities and AI tutorials, hosted on https://hourofai.org.
- Students and educators can choose an Hour of AI activity, and in less than one hour, learn the basics of AI.
- Minecraft has worked with Code.org and Microsoft for 10+ years, delivering engaging tutorials and driving engagement through an annual global campaign, customer and community engagement, and teacher training. We have reached 300M sessions of Minecraft Hour of Code through this work and will build on that momentum to go big with Hour of AI.

 

**In Minecraft’s “Hour of AI 2025: The First Night,” students will:**

- **Explore the Minecraft world** to survive the first night, partnering with the Agent to learn and adapt.
- **Train the Agent** to classify materials, recognize patterns, and solve problems—just like real AI!
- **Code and collaborate** to collect wood, craft tools, build a shelter, and make a bed.
- **Practice human-in-the-loop thinking** by verifying the Agent’s work and correcting mistakes.
- **Share your unique strategies and creations** with friends and classmates with the AI Build Challenge finale!
