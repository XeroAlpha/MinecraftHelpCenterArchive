**What is Hour of AI?**

[**Hour of AI**](https://aka.ms/hourofai) is Minecraft Education’s newest global coding and artificial intelligence experience, designed to build on the legacy of ten years of Hour of Code. After a decade of empowering millions of learners to take their first steps in computer science, Minecraft Education is expanding the journey, helping students and educators everywhere understand, create, and shape the future with artificial intelligence.

Hour of AI is a new initiative by Code.org, building on a decade of impact with Hour of Code, that seeks to demystify AI for millions of learners worldwide through accessible activities and AI tutorials, hosted on HourofAI.org. Students and educators can choose an Hour of AI activity, and in less than one hour, learn the basics of AI.

Minecraft has worked with Code.org and Microsoft for 10+ years, delivering engaging tutorials and driving engagement through an annual global campaign, customer and community engagement, and teacher training. We have reached 300M sessions of Minecraft Hour of Code through this work and will build on that momentum to go big with Hour of AI.

Hour of AI, is central to our [AI Foundations](https://aka.ms/minecraftai) collection of AI Literacy experiences. These tutorials introduce students to foundational AI concepts through hands-on, game-based learning. Learners will demystify AI, explore how it works, and imagine what’s possible when they harness it for good.   
  
 

**Why did Minecraft Education create Hour of AI after ten years of Hour of Code?**

Building on the success of Hour of Code, Hour of AI responds to the growing need for AI literacy in today’s world. Students are already using AI, but many don’t understand how it works, how to use it responsibly, or how to shape what’s coming next. Hour of AI helps students move from watchers to leaders, empowering them to participate fully in an increasingly automated society as informed citizens, ethical decision-makers, and creative problem-solvers.
