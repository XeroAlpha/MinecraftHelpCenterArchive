Minecraft is supporting the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) to enable educators and experts with an easy, fun, and accessible way to introduce basic coding concepts using the popular video game students already know and love. We have joined forces with Code.org to create [Minecraft Hour of Code tutorials](http://code.org/mc) to help students learn introductory computer science concepts for the past four years and look forward to hearing about your Hour of Code experience and creations.

 

## 2024

Let your students code, create, and take the spotlight with *Hour of Code 2024: The Show Must Go On!* In this bustling theater-themed lesson, students become the star coder, director, and creative mastermind. Solve puzzles and learn key computer science skills while saving the show!

Through Minecraft’s Hour of Code activities, students of all ages can dive into computer science in fun, interactive ways that spark creativity, develop problem-solving and critical thinking, and build a foundational knowledge of basic coding.

**Code the show, save the day with Minecraft**

In this new Hour of Code adventure, students will explore the theater to find the missing star, the Agent, while solving fun coding puzzles and interacting with lively characters. Students can help the Agent overcome stage fright as they navigate backstage areas like the Dance Studio and Prop Department. For the grand finale, they will customize the stage show with their creative input and watch their coding skills come to life! 

 

## 2023

In Minecraft Hour of Code: Generation AI,students venture through time to create AI-powered inventions. They activate problem-solving skills, creativity, and computational thinking to explore [Responsible AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai). 

The journey starts with an unexpected visit from the Agent, who comes with an urgent mission. They’ll guide your students through a series of future scenarios where they correct problems stemming from wayward AI tools. Throughout the challenges, learners resolve issues around fairness and discrimination, reliability and safety, and more as they progress toward an epic finale.

Minecraft Hour of Code: Generation AI won’t just inspire students to learn coding basics. It will also drive thoughtful discussions about the ethical implications of coding and AI development.

 

## 2022

Are you ready to put your computational thinking skills to the test? For 2022, students embark on an escape room adventure with Escape Estate. You have been invited by the rich and famous Dr. Breakowski to try and earn a million emeralds. Use coding and computational thinking to unlock secrets, open trap doors, and reveal hidden clues to escape his mysterious mansion by dawn. Be careful though, because things are not as they seem, and every room contains new puzzles. With three levels of challenges, and coding in blocks or Python, Hour of Code offers a learning pathway for anyone to learn the basics of code. The lesson is available for free in Minecraft: Education at [aka.ms/hourofcode2022](http://aka.ms/hourofcode2022). This Hour of Code tutorial is available inside Minecraft Education and free to play without a license or Office 365 Education account.  

 

## 2021 

In 2021, the Hour of Code tutorial is again available inside Minecraft Education and free to play without a license or Office 365 Education account. This year’s theme, TimeCraft, showcases the importance of computer science skills – they are truly everywhere and for everyone, no matter where, who or when you are! This Hour of Code adventure travels through time and space and explores the concept of building a better future through code. Players will experience a choose your own adventure game, exploring diverse key moments in human achievement. Traversing the ages, players will connect with innovators and inventions, learn about the impact of advances in art, architecture, music, engineering, science, math, and computer science, and practice critical thinking and deductive reasoning. Using their coding superpower, players will save the future by solving mysterious incongruities in the past, collecting clues, and connecting patterns to identify the mischievous time culprit.   

This year’s lesson is offered in both Blocks and Python. 

 

## 2020

In 2020, the Hour of Code tutorial is again available inside Minecraft: Education Edition and free to play without a license or Office 365 Education account. This year's lesson is A Minecraft Tale of Two Villages. For centuries, the Villagers and Illagers shared the same space but seldom interacted with each other. Now you can use the power of code to bring the two villages together. Players will experience empathy and compassion for their neighbors, learn cooperation and inclusion, and embrace the diversity that makes us all uniquely special.

This year’s lesson is offered in both Blocks and Python.

 

## 2019

In 2019, the Hour of Code tutorial was created as a lesson available inside Minecraft Education.  This demo lesson was made available to all users, even those who don't currently have a valid Office 365 Education account. In this years lesson users learn about wildfires and how we can use AI to prevent them. 

 

## 2018

In 2018 we launched the Voyage Aquatic, a new Minecraft Hour of Code that takes learners on an aquatic adventure to find treasure and solve puzzle with code. Discover dolphins, plunder prismarine and build a conduit while learning about loops and conditionals. Partnering with Code.org for a fourth straight year, Minecraft Hour of Code has reached nearly 100 million sessions.

 

## 2017

In 2017 we joined Computer Science Education week each year for a fresh Minecraft lesson! We introduced the Agent from our popular Code Connection application, and focused on:

- Loops
- Debugging
- Functions
- Exploration through free play
- A Diamond Path for additional coding challenges
- Exporting to Minecraft Education to continue the learning and fun.

## 2016

In 2016, students were provided the opportunity to be a “Minecraft Designer” and program entities to learn the following topics:

- Forever Loops
- Random
- Events
- When statements
- Wait

## 2015

During our first year, the student controlled either Alex or Steve in a series of puzzles in “Minecraft Adventurer”, introducing the concepts of:

- Loops
- Nesting
- If Statements
