### Lesson Overview

For centuries, the Villagers and Illagers shared the same space but seldom interacted with each other. Now you can use the power of code to bring the two villages together. Players will experience empathy and compassion for their neighbors, learn cooperation and inclusion, and embrace the diversity that makes us all uniquely special.

This year’s lesson is offered in both Blocks and Python and is only available on version 1.14.50. For information on how to update go [here](https://aka.ms/MEEUpdateFAQ).

### Lesson Objectives

By the end of the lesson the students will:

- Understand the importance and benefits of diversity, including the role of diversity and inclusion in a community
- Understand bias and recognize how it may cause harm
- Create coding solutions that include sequences, events, and loops
- Decompose (break down) the steps needed to solve a problem into a precise sequence of instructions
- Iterate on coding solutions to complete a task

### Remote Learning

If you plan to offer this lesson via remote learning, please consider these tips:

1.  This lesson is not designed as a multiplayer experience. Each individual student should work in their own version of the world.
2.  Divide students into pairs or small groups via breakout rooms so they can help one another troubleshoot as they solve coding puzzles.
3.  Given that students are likely to have varying levels of familiarity with Minecraft and coding, it may help to assign student group leaders to help peers who may get stuck.
