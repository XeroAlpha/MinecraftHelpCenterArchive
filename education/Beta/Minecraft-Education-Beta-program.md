*Note: Minecraft Education is moving to a Preview system that replaces our Beta system. The preview apps allow users to have both the primary game client plus the preview app installed at the same time. View our [Minecraft Education Preview article](https://aka.ms/MCEDUPreviewFAQ) to learn more* about how to get started with our Preview program.

 

Thank you for your interest in our Beta program! We're excited to get your feedback on our new features before we release them to the general public. View our [Change Log](https://aka.ms/meechangelog) for most recent versions. 

## Frequency of Betas

While in the past we would release a beta about a month before the general update was available, we are now releasing more frequent betas. These will be as often as monthly but may vary in frequency based on testing needs. This will help us get your feedback sooner and ensure our general release updates provide a smooth experience.

## How do I join the beta?

Check out our article [Download Minecraft Education Beta](https://aka.ms/MEEBetaDownload), to learn more about supported platforms and how to install the latest Minecraft Education beta on your platform.  

## How to continue participating in the beta

If you have downloaded and installed our beta version, you will continue to get future beta releases. Chromebook, Android, and Windows users should instead switch to the [Minecraft Education Preview](https://aka.ms/MCEDUPreviewFAQ) which will receive automatic updates.

- iOS users will continue to receive betas through TestFlight.
- macOS users need to manually install future beta releases.
- Windows desktop users are automatically updated when a new version is available.

## How to stop receiving beta releases

Here is information on how to stop receiving beta releases by platform.

- Chromebook and Android users can choose to stop receiving future beta versions in the Play Store. See the [Leave a beta program](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/beta-program#leave_the_beta_program_using_the_play_store) section on the Google Play Help site for information on how to opt out.
- iOS users can visit the [TestFlight](https://aka.ms/joinmee-testflight) page and scroll down to the **Opting Out** section for more details.
- For Windows and macOS, uninstall the beta version of Minecraft Education and install the production version from the Minecraft Education [download page](https://education.minecraft.net/get-started/download).

**IMPORTANT**! Export your worlds before uninstalling or they will be deleted. See the [Importing and Exporting Your Worlds](https://aka.ms/MEEImportExport) article for more information.

 

## How to get the general release version - when available

If you have opted into our beta program, here’s how you can get the general update when it releases.

- iOS and Windows desktop (.exe) installs are automatically upgraded when the release is available
- MacOS users need to install the general release manually once it's available on the Minecraft: Education Edition download page.

**IMPORTANT!** Export your worlds before uninstalling or they will be deleted. See the [Importing and Exporting Your Worlds article](https://aka.ms/MEEImportExport) for more information.
