*Note: Minecraft Education is moving to a Preview system that replaces our Beta system. The preview apps allow users to have both the primary game client plus the preview app installed at the same time. View our* [*Minecraft Education Preview article*](https://aka.ms/MCEDUPreviewFAQ) *to learn more* *about how to* [get started with our Preview program](./Minecraft-Education-Preview-Program.md).

Thank you for your interest in our Beta program! We're excited to get your feedback on our new features before we release them to the general public. View our [Change Log](https://aka.ms/meechangelog) for most recent versions. 

## Frequency of Betas

While in the past we would release a beta about a month before the general update was available, we are now releasing more frequent betas. These will be as often as monthly but may vary in frequency based on testing needs. This will help us get your feedback sooner and ensure our general release updates provide a smooth experience.

## How do I join the beta?

## How to continue participating in the beta

- **Chromebook, Android, and Windows users should switch to the** [**Minecraft Education Preview**](https://aka.ms/MCEDUPreviewFAQ) **which will receive automatic updates.**

- Windows desktop users are automatically updated when a new version is available.

## How to stop receiving beta releases

Here is information on how to stop receiving beta releases by platform.

- Chromebook and Android users can choose to stop receiving future beta versions in the Play Store.
