Welcome to the Dedicated Server beta/preview (v1.21.130) for Minecraft: Education! We are thrilled to announce our first public beta for a long-requested feature: Dedicated Servers for Minecraft Education, which are Education-specific, self-hosted dedicated servers for use in classrooms and Esports!

We are so excited to finally be able to offer this feature for public testing. If you choose to participate in the beta, you will help us tremendously in finalizing and polishing this feature, and we are extremely thankful for your time.

Note that this beta requires technical expertise and support from your tenant’s global IT admin to set up servers, including the ability to run scripts. 

Please let us know all about the things you love, as well as challenges you run into by contributing to our [Beta feedback forum](https://aka.ms/MEEBetaFeedback).

##  

**Note:** The Windows .exe beta version does not yet have an update to v1.21.130 and thus will not be able to connect to multiplayer sessions from devices that are on v.1.21.130 . We expect to have a Windows .exe beta build in January.
