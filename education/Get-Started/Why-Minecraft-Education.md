We're thrilled that you’re interested in teaching, learning, and innovating with Minecraft Education! Minecraft Education is a collaborative and versatile application that offers educators a transformative way to engage students and ignite their passion for learning.

 

The application contains features not found in other editions of Minecraft - Java and Bedrock. Minecraft Education allows instructors to have oversight into the activities of their students. Educators in grades K-12 are using Minecraft Education to teach a range of subjects, from history and chemistry to sustainability and foreign languages. Educators can map lessons directly to specific learning outcomes and curriculum standards. Through these project-based lessons, students build critical 21st-century skills like collaboration, creative problem solving, and digital citizenship.
