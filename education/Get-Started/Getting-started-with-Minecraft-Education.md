If you’re a teacher and would like some training on how to use Minecraft Education, there are a wealth of options available. The options range from in-person to self-directed online courses. To learn more, check out [Training for Minecraft Educators](https://aka.ms/meetraining).

 

## Getting Started for IT Admins:

These are the stages involved in getting started with Minecraft on all devices.

### 1.      Check the system requirements

Minecraft Education can be installed on Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS, and as of 2022, mobile Android and iOS as well. To ensure your experience with Minecraft Education is top-notch, make sure your devices meet the minimum system requirements.

To check if your device supports Minecraft Education, see [System Requirements](https://aka.ms/MEESystemRequirements).  
  

### 2.      Allowlist Minecraft Education URLs

Minecraft Education requires access to our service's URLs. Ensure that our URLs and ports are not blocked on your network. [Learn more here. ](https://aka.ms/MEEITAdminGuide)  
  

### 3.      Try Minecraft: Education Edition for free

Minecraft Education is available for anyone to try. If you have an Office 365 Education account or a Microsoft 365 account, you can start a free trial of Minecraft Education. The trial is a fully functional version of Minecraft Education. The only limit is the number of times you can sign in. If you don’t have an Office 365 Education account or a Microsoft 365 account, you can still try one of the demo lessons available for Minecraft Education.

To learn more about trying Minecraft Education, check out [Try Minecraft Education for free](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047116432).  
  

### 4.      Purchase licenses

Minecraft Education licenses are purchased via a yearly subscription. Individual licenses can be purchased directly from Microsoft or, if you’re part of an eligible educational institution, you can connect with a partner to purchase volume licenses.

To learn more about purchasing Minecraft Education licenses, see [Purchasing Options for Minecraft Education Licenses](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360061371532).  
  

### 5.      Create users accounts and assign licenses

To play Minecraft Education, each user requires a license. The license allows the user to sign into the game on any supported device. An IT administrator creates user accounts in Microsoft 365 Admin Center then assigns licenses to users. The process for assigning licenses depends on how the licenses were purchased.

To learn more about creating user accounts, see [Add Users and Assign Licenses at the Same Time](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users?view=o365-worldwide) in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center Help.

- To learn more about assigning licenses in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, see [Manage Licenses for Camps, Clubs, Homeschool and Other Organizations](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360061370372).  
    

### 6.      Install Minecraft Education

Minecraft Education can be installed on supported devices manually or through system management software. The installation process depends on the device you are deploying it to.

To learn more about installing Minecraft Education, see the installation guides for each device:

- [Windows](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/13106858087956)
- [Chromebook](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4404625978516)
- [iOS](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047556351)
- [MacOS](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047118792)

## Next steps

Once licenses for Minecraft Education have been purchased and assigned and the game installed, users can begin signing in to play, learn, and create!
