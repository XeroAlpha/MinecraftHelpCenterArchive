- "View my Worlds" will show you all of your existing worlds you can load up. 
  - If you do not have any worlds yet, this area will be empty.
- "View Library" will bring you to the categories Subject Kits, Monthly Build Challenges, Starter Worlds, and How to Play. 
  - The "How to Play" section is a great place to start if you are new to Minecraft controls!
- "Create New" will allow you to choose either "New" or "Templates". The new world is the standard Minecraft generation. Templates shows our featured lessons and a few starter worlds.
  - The Blocks of Grass world under Templates is a great controlled, simple environment to experiment for both new and experienced users! 
- "Join World" will allow you to enter the Join Code or IP of another user who is hosting a multiplayer session. 
- "Import" allows you to open worlds you've downloaded.
