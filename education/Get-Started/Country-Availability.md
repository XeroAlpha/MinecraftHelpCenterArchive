Minecraft Education is available for purchase in many countries.  

- To check if Minecraft Education is available in your country through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, refer to the [International Availability](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/international-availability) article on the admin center support site.  
- Note that while the above lists where Microsoft 365 is available and Minecraft Education's international availability is largely similar, there may be exceptions. Namely, that Minecraft Education is not available for purchase in China.
