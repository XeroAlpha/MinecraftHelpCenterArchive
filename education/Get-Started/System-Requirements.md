At this time, Minecraft Education is supported on Chromebook, iPad, Mac, PC, and Mobile. This article provides information on the minimum requirements for each platform.

 

**Notes on upcoming changes:**

**32-bit Support ending:** Support for 32-bit Windows (also called Windows x86) automatic updates is ending. All devices that support 64-bit Windows will automatically update to the 64-bit version of Minecraft Education. 32-bit Windows OS support and 32-bit Android & Chromebook OS support will be ending on or after December 31, 2025. This will not affect any devices that have a 64-bit OS. 

**RAM Minimum Requirements:** Minimum and recommended memory (RAM) requirements will increase on or after December 31, 2025. 

 

## **Operating system requirements**

These are the operating systems (OS) that we support for Minecraft Education.

|                        |                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Device**             | **Minimum supported OS\*** |
| Chromebook             | Chrome OS 114              |
| Mac                    | macOS 12 (Monterey)        |
| PC                     | Windows 10                 |
| Android Phone / Tablet | Android 8                  |
| iPhone / iPad          | iOS 13 / iPadOS 13         |

*\***Note**: Minecraft Education should be able to run on the minimum supported operating systems; however, the experience will generally be better on the latest OS.  Issues discovered that are specific to the minimum supported OS versions will **not** be prioritized.*

 

## **Hardware requirements**

These are the minimum and recommended hardware requirements needed to run Minecraft Education.

Minimum specifications: Should allow you to participate in all common scenarios in Minecraft Education - such as library content, coding, and multiplayer - with some limitations such as low frame rates, shorter rendering distances, occasional lag, and performance issues. When hosting a multiplayer session of 5 or more people you may experience significant performance issues such as lag, rubberbanding, players disconnecting, inventory not opening, etc.

Recommended specifications: Should allow you to see consistent performance for all common scenarios with minimal limitations and should allow you to successfully host larger multiplayer sessions with 10 or more participants.
