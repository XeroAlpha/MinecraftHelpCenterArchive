Minecraft Education is available to anyone to try for free! There are two ways to try Minecraft Education for free, through the free trial or through the demo lesson. The free trial requires you to have a Entra ID account, either an Office 365 Education account or a Microsoft 365 account (Note: Personal versions of Office 365 or Microsoft 365 do not provide access nor trial access to Minecraft Education). The demo lesson does not require any account or log-in. This article provides information on how to use the free trial and the demo lesson. 

 

## Technical requirements 

Minecraft Education can be played on Chromebook, iPad, Mac, and PC. Before trying Minecraft Education, check the [System Requirements](https://aka.ms/MEESystemRequirements) article to ensure your device is supported. 

 

## About the free trial 

The free trial is fully functional and contains all the features of the paid version. The trial is compatible with Classroom Mode. For more information on these features, see the [Get Started with Classroom Mode](https://aka.ms/MEEUseClassroomMode) articles. 

 

The trial is limited by the number of logins (25 for teachers with an Office 365 Education account and 10 for all other users) before a paid license is required to continue playing. Trial logins **cannot** be refreshed – if you have any issues, [contact our support team](https://aka.ms/MEE_New_Request) right away so you don’t use all your trial logins! After your trial logins have been used, Minecraft Education is available to purchase. 

  

### Start the free trial 

If you have an organizational Office 365 Education or a Microsoft 365 Education account, follow these steps to start the free trial. 

1.  From the [Get Minecraft Education](https://education.minecraft.net/get-started/download) download page, select the version of Minecraft Education to download that is compatible with your device. 
2.  Install the version of Minecraft Education that you downloaded. 
3.  Launch and sign into Minecraft Education with your Office 365 Education account information (this may be your school email) or with your Microsoft 365 account information.

## About the demo lessons 

Demo lessons allow you to try Minecraft Education for free and without an account. Each demo lesson has limited functionality: for example worlds and progress cannot be saved, and it is not possible to join or host a multiplayer game. Playing a demo lesson allows you the opportunity to experience a real lesson in Minecraft Education.  There is no limit on the number of times you play each demo lesson.
