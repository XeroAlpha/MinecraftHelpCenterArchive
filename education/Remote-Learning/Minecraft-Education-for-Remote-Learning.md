As COVID-19 concerns prompt school closures around the world, many parents are turning to remote learning to keep students engaged.  Features like classroom [multiplayer](./How-To-Set-Up-A-Multiplayer-Game.md) allow students to collaborate on projects in their Minecraft worlds, building, planning, learning and even chatting as they work together. When they are ready to document their work and submit their projects, students can use tools like the [Camera and Book & Quill](../Game-Features/Assessment-Tools-Cameras-Portfolio-Book-Quill.md) to take screenshots, write about their work and export their in-game portfolios in PDF format.

## Multiplayer

Multiplayer is one of the most popular and effective ways to leverage Minecraft and is a great way to stay connected with classmates, even when collaborating remotely.  Working together encourages collaboration, communication and problem solving as students work together on projects in a shared Minecraft world.

Multiplayer across different internet connections is possible as long as the criteria in our [multiplayer guide](./How-To-Set-Up-A-Multiplayer-Game.md) is met. Keep in mind that every home network is different, so it's possible that some players may not be able to join a multiplayer session from their respective networks due to distinct configuration settings. Anti-virus and firewall applications may block access to multiplayer, so ensure you configure these programs to allow access to Minecraft Education.

Our support team is limited in our ability to troubleshoot these unique network issues, but we are always happy to try to help.

## Help!

The [Support Center](https://aka.ms/mcedusupport) has a wealth of information to help answer your questions, as well as access to a robust and supportive community.  You can also contact our support desk for help if you aren't able to find the answers you need.
