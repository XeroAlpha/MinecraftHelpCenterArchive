We understand that everyone loves to learn with Minecraft. The great news is that there are other options to learn using the [Bedrock](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition) and [Java](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition) editions of Minecraft!

### Family-Friendly Activities

Visit our [Distance Learning](https://aka.ms/minecraftathome) page for immersive, fun, and educational self-guided activities for players to try at home with any version of Minecraft.

### Educational Worlds in Bedrock

The Minecraft Marketplace team has added a new [Education category](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.minecraft.net%2Fen-us%2Fmarketplace%2Feducation&data=02%7C01%7CCarrie.Doring%40microsoft.com%7C5819b6ea20c341a8800c08d7d110d7d6%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637207742575072907&sdata=3%2F2%2FZW7XIWz3FQW1675cdpbRQJJUNixHL00paOSWUjw%3D&reserved=0) to make content available to all Minecraft players and families.

### Hour of Code

Many Hour of Code worlds are available to play without logging in.  You can download and [play free lessons](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047116432) without a Microsoft 365 Education account.

You can also take advantage of many [Minecraft themed coding exercises](https://code.org/minecraft) on the Code.org website.  

### Using Education Features 

Minecraft Education has several features designed for classroom use, to help educators and students build lessons, document their creations and explore STEM subjects. A few of these features are available in Bedrock and some can also can be replicated in the Java version.

1.  To use the **Chemistry features** in Minecraft Bedrock, turn the Education Edition settings on when you create a new world. Toggle **Activate Cheats** and **Education** to the on position in the Cheats menu. We recommend using these features on a desktop device with moderate to high memory.![educational_features.png](https://edusupport.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/4402655311124)
2.  Some lessons will call for the use of the [camera](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Camera) to assess student progress. When using other versions of Minecraft, ask students to take screenshots to capture their progress.  
3.  Some lessons will call for students to use the [book and quill](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Book_and_Quill%C2%A0%C2%A0) to record observations, ideas, or reflections. If you are working in a version of Minecraft where **book and quill** is not available, have students complete written activities using a text editor like Microsoft Word or a pencil and paper. 

 

### Coding with Java Edition

More advanced coders can take advantage of the open-source framework of the Minecraft Java edition to create modifications (mods) of the game code-base.  There are many online tutorials and sites dedicated to learning to mod, as well as courses taught through independent learning centers.  Modding requires more advanced coding skills and knowledge of the Java language, so is a great way to challenge more advanced learners.

### Using Lessons and Build Challenges for Inspiration

Educators, parents, and students can still benefit from many of the [lessons](https://education.minecraft.net/class-resources/lessons/) available for free on the Minecraft Education web site, even if the worlds are not compatible with Bedrock or Java. 

Challenge your kids to build in Minecraft!  Here are some fun ideas to try even if you don't have access to Minecraft Education.

1.  Build your bedroom
2.  Recreate your neighborhood
3.  Create a home for a character in your favorite book
4.  Build a roller coaster using [Minecarts](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecart) and [Redstone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Block_of_Redstone)
5.  Build a [Redstone circuit](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mechanics/Redstone/Circuit)
6.  Build a historical building from another era
7.  What can you build with 64 blocks?
