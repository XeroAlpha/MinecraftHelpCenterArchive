If you can’t find your world in Minecraft Education, you can check your local folder. Worlds are stored in the minecraftWorlds folder in individual folders. 

 

To convert world folders to Minecraft Worlds:

1.  copy the entire folder for this world to your desktop, or another convenient location
2.  open the folder in this new location, select all of the files in the directory, right click and then select "Send to Compressed (zipped) folder"
3.  A new file with extension ".zip" will show up in this folder.  Move this .zip file to the desktop, or another convenient location
4.  Rename the .zip file to "\[WORLDNAME\].mcworld" - WORLDNAME is a name you choose that is recognizable to you
5.  Double click on this file, and Minecraft Education will launch

## Show hidden files

To locate the folder or world file, you may need to enable the setting to view hidden files.

For Chromebook

- Ensure the Minecraft Education has [storage permission](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7515036?hl=en).
- Enable view of hidden files by selecting **..** \> **Show hidden files** and **Show all Play folders** from the **Files** window.

For PC, [enable view hidden files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5).

 

## Path to world files by device platform

**Chromebook**:

- Play files \> games \> com.mojang \> minecraftWorlds

**iPad**:

- Minecraft Education Edition\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds

**Mac**: 

- HD \> Users \> \[*USERNAME*\] \> Library \> Application support \> Minecraftpe \> Games \> com.mojang

**PC Desktop version: **

- C:\Users\\*USERNAME*\]\AppData\Roaming\Minecraft Education Edition\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds

**PC Store version:**

- C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftEducationEdition_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds

*Note: “*\[*USERNAME*\]*” refers to the user account used to log in to the device, not the sign in for Minecraft Education.*

 

## World files a GUID for the file name

Minecraft Education world files are saved using a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID), a series of letters and numbers that don't correlate to the world name you created.

Follow these steps to locate the world name.

1.  From the **minecraftWorlds** folder, select one of the folders.
2.  Open the **levelname** text document.  
    **Result:** The text file opens and displays the world name as it appears in Minecraft Education.

If you have a lot of worlds and do not want to search through all the folders to locate the world file you want, sort the **minecraftWorlds** folder by date and open the folder with a date/time close to the last time you were in the world.
