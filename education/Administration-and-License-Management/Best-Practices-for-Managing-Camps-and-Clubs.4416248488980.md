Camps and Clubs present a different model from the Academic usage of Minecraft Education, both for license management and permitted usage of Minecraft brand, assets and learning materials.  Read on for information about navigating these differences.

## How to Re-allocate licenses across your Camps and Clubs

Since Camps and Clubs are normally run as limited time classes with changing rosters, we wanted to offer some tips to manage Minecraft Education licenses for your programs.  

### Unique User accounts (**Recommended)**

The recommended, compliant method to manage your licenses in your program is to create a unique (AAD) user account for each student and assign a license for the duration of the class.  When the class is complete, you can remove licenses from the previous students and then re-assign the licenses to the new group of student accounts.  

#### Advantages to using this method:

- Unique user accounts allow you to identify students in-world in multiplayer sessions, which allows for better communication and ability to monitor student behavior.
- Work done by students is associated with their user account.  With unique accounts, student work will only be available to the students who created it, other students won't be able to change or delete it.
- Teams integration for lesson assignment allows for individual lesson management
- Future features on the product roadmap will rely on ability to identify users to connect them to new services

### Recycle User Accounts (**Not Recommended**)

While it is possible to create a set of user accounts that you re-use for each class, this method has many drawbacks including **not being in compliance with our usage terms**. 

#### Issues with using this method:

- This method is a **violation of Microsoft online services usage terms**
- If passwords aren't changed on the accounts between classes, students from previous classes could maintain access to your licenses
- Students have access to other students' work and could be exposed to material not intended for them
- Students can alter or delete other students' work
- Can't uniquely track activities of each student

## Usage Guidelines for Camps and Clubs

The Commercial license used for Camps and Clubs allows for a different level of usage than the Academic license.  

- Read the [Minecraft Education Usage Guidelines](https://aka.ms/EducationUsageGuidelines)
- Use of Minecraft Education Commercial licenses is governed by the [Microsoft Product Terms for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/EES). 
- Commercial organizations do not have resale rights for Minecraft Education licenses. Licenses are owned and must be managed by the commercial organization that purchased them; ownership is not transferrable to another entity.
- You are welcome to use the application and our lesson content in your classes, including classes for which you charge a fee.
- You cannot re-package our lessons or other learning material and sell it outside of your company.
