License management is how you assign or unassign licenses to the users who will play Minecraft Education. Managing your licenses used to depend on two factors: the type of licenses you purchased (academic or commercial) and where you purchased them (either in the Store for Education or the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.) However, we have migrated all Store for Education licenses to the Admin Center. Note that only IT Admins have access to Admin Center so you'll need to reach out to your IT Admin for assistance with license management for the time being. 

*Note: If you are not sure which type of license you have or are an educator who purchased licenses in Store and no one in your school has access to Admin center, [contact our support team](https://aka.ms/MEE_New_Request) and we'll help you out!*
