The migration of Minecraft Education licenses from the Microsoft Store for Education to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center is now complete! 

Our goal for this migration was for our customers to experience minimal impact.  Both your licenses and user assignments were migrated to the admin center, so you should not experience any Minecraft Education service disruption due to the migration.

Read on for important information to help you use Minecraft Education in the admin center and Intune.

### Intune app deployment

Intune will stop deploying Store for Education apps on **June 15th, 2023**. Migrate to the new Microsoft Store app to keep deploying Minecraft Education.

### Auto-claim in the admin center

Auto-claim will be available for Minecraft Education in the admin center very soon!  This feature allows you to set up a policy that will automatically assign available Minecraft Education licenses to an unlicensed user when they log into the application.

**Note**: auto-claim is not available for the **Minecraft Education Invoice** subscription.  This subscription will be retired over the next year, and the subscription that will replace it will work with auto-claim.

### License Management in the Admin Center

There may be slight changes to the way that you manage and renew your license subscriptions in the admin center.  Refer to these resources for more information.

Customers who purchased licenses using a credit card in the Store for Education:

- You will need to [manually renew your subscription in the admin center](./Manually-renew-your-Minecraft-Education-trial-subscription.md) once, and then you can set your subscription to renew automatically.

Licenses purchased by users that are not IT Admins were not migrated. 

- If you believe your tenant may own licenses purchased by non-admins, reach out to the [Minecraft Education support team](https://aka.ms/MEE_New_Request) for help manually migrating your licenses.

Customers who own licenses purchased using an Invoice in the Store for Education:

- You can now [manage your licenses in the admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide).

Customers who own licenses purchased through a CSP or other VL option:

- You can now [manage your licenses in the admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide).
