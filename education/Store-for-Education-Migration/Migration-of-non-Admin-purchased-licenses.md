The Microsoft Store for Education is [retiring in the first quarter of 2023](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/microsoft-store-for-business-education-retiring).  This retirement impacts your Minecraft Education subscriptions and may require manual configuration from you.  

## How this will affect your organization

If your tenant owns licenses that were purchased by non-Admins in the Store for Education, then those licenses **will not be automatically migrated to the Microsoft 365 admin center**.

- The Store for Education allowed non-Admins to purchase and manage Minecraft Education licenses for your organization. Your organization owns a number of these licenses that are currently managed in the Store for Education.
- The admin center does not allow purchase or management by non-Admins, so we are unable to migrate these licenses directly.
- You may already have licenses in the admin center that you can assign to affected users.

## If you are an IT Admin

Reach out to the [Minecraft Education Support team](https://aka.ms/MEE_New_Request) if you would like help manually migrating any non-admin purchased licenses that were on the Store for Education.

## If you are not an IT Admin

The admin center doesn’t offer the ability for non-admin users to buy or assign licenses for a tenant, so we can’t migrate licenses bought by users that aren’t admins. There are three options to renew your Minecraft Education subscriptions after March 31, 2023:

- Contact your IT Lead to see if your school already has access to Minecraft Education licenses through other license bundles.
- A Global Administrator or Billing Administrator for your organization can buy new licenses in the admin center. Contact the IT Lead for your school to have them purchase new licenses or ask them to grant you a [Billing Administrator role](https://emails-ppe.azure.microsoft.com/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fadmin%2Fadd-users%2Fassign-admin-roles%3Fview%3Do365-worldwide&p=bT0wMDAwMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAmdT1hZW8tcHJldmlldyZsPWFzc2lnbi1hZG1pbi1yb2xlcw%3D%3D) in your tenant.
- If you would like to manage licenses in your tenant, you can request a [User Administrator role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide).
- If your tenant does not have an owner, you can follow these [steps to become the administrator for your tenant](https://emails-ppe.azure.microsoft.com/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Feducation%2Fdeploy%2Fbecoming-an-admin-in-office-365-education%3FredirectSourcePath%3D%25252fen-us%25252farticle%25252fbecome-an-admin-in-office-365-education-22d6591b-a5af-41f9-bc86-52f62e7aa400&p=bT0wMDAwMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAmdT1hZW8tcHJldmlldyZsPWJlY29taW5nLWFuLWFkbWluLWluLW9mZmljZS0zNjUtZWR1Y2F0aW9u).
