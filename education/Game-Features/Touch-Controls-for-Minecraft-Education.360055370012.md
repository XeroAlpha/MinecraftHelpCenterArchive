Minecraft Education with touch controls offers players a chance to play on an iPad and certain Chromebooks. While this can be really fun and engaging for players, the controls are also different from our other platforms that use a traditional keyboard and mouse. This article will break down how to use the basic touch game controls for Minecraft Education. You can also print out [this control layout sheet](https://education.minecraft.net/content/dam/education-edition/software-downloads/MCEDU%20Movement%20Control%20Guide.pdf).
