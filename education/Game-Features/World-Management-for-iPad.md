One of the most exciting parts about bringing Minecraft Education into the classroom can be having individuals or groups work on their own individual worlds and see what creative ideas students and teachers can come up with!

Getting a world file out to a group or individual on an iPad can be a slightly different process than doing so on a PC or Mac. This article help clear up the confusion by showing some best practices used by Teachers from around the world!

Below are some suggested steps and tips to help:

**Select the .MCWORLD file you would like to use**

- This can be a world that you created yourself and have exported 
- It can also be a world that you have downloaded from our website (pictured below). Any .MCWORLD file will work

**Upload the .MCWORLD file to a shared location that can be accessed by  everyone**

- These locations could include:
  - Sharepoint folder
  - DropBox folder
  - Shared email inbox
  - Google Drive
  - One Drive
  - Canvas
  - Microsoft Teams 
  - iCloud Drive (pictured Below)
  - And many other options!

 *Tip: If you are uploading the world to a shared location ensure all users have the permissions to access the location*

**Access the shared location and download the world to Minecraft Education**

*iCloud Drive is pictured above and instructs to "copy" world to Minecraft Education*

**Minecraft Education will start after download and the world will import**

**Alternate scenarios:**

What if the teacher is on an iPad but the students are on Mac/PC?

- Make sure the world shared with students through a means that is accessible via PC or Mac. For example Sharepoint would be accessible by both PC and Mac but iCloud may not be accessible via a PC.

What if the teacher is on a Mac/PC and the students are on a iPad?

- Make sure the world is shared with students through a means that is accessible through an iPad. For example email would be a means where the teacher could send the world file from their Mac/PC and students could open email on their iPad and import the world.

Can I use AirDrop? How do I use this?

- AirDrop lets you quickly and easily transfer files between iPads and Macs. It uses Bluetooth LE to broadcast, discover, and negotiate connections, and point-to-point Wi-Fi to transfer files. AirDrop is not compatible with PC.
