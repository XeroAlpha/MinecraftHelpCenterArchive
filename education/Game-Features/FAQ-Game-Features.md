**When will Minecraft Education get the latest Minecraft features?**

Minecraft Education normally runs about one full version behind the Minecraft Bedrock production version. When we start work on our next release, we adopt the latest version of Bedrock possible based on their production cycle as well as how ready their code is for us to adopt. We do this to ensure the best experience for our users.

Our next release will contain many of the new Minecraft features that are live in the Bedrock edition today.

 

## **How do Multiplayer Games function?** 

Minecraft Education multiplayer games take place connecting over IP. Multiplayer games have a capacity of 40 players, for iPad, Windows, ChromeOS, and MacOS. Check out our [Multiplayer Guide](../Remote-Learning/How-To-Set-Up-A-Multiplayer-Game.md) for more information. Server style multiplayer is not available. Server licenses are not available.

 

**Can I play multiplayer with other versions of Minecraft?**

No. Minecraft Education is not compatible with other versions of Minecraft such as Java or Bedrock etc.

 

## **Can students play Multiplayer with players on other internet connections at home?**

While this is possible if all of the requirements from the [Multiplayer Guide](../Remote-Learning/How-To-Set-Up-A-Multiplayer-Game.md) are met, it can be very difficult to setup and it is not recommended. Each individual network will need to satisfy network requirements. Our support team is not equipped to handle troubleshooting of individual home networks.

 

**Why can't I run code in another player's world**

In order to run code and use your agent in a world hosted by another player you need to have Operator Permissions.

 

**Can I play multiplayer with users on other Office 365 tenants?**

Educators and students can only use the multiplayer feature within their O365 EDU tenant, which means students can only collaborate with other students from the same tenant.  The scope of a tenant is determined by your school organization, and is normally set to the school or district.  You can contact your IT department to understand how your tenant has been set up. Users can connect with other users on different domains, provided they are within the same tenant. 

 

**What accessibility features are in Minecraft Education?**

You can learn more about the accessibility features Minecraft Education has in [our article here](./Accessibility-Features.md). 

 

**Can multiple teacher accounts play in the same world?**

Yes, also each teacher account will have OP by default. For more info, [view our article on profile types and permissions.](./Profile-Types-and-Permissions.md)

 

**What is Classroom Mode and how do I use it?**

Classroom Mode is a companion app for Minecraft Education that enables educators to manage world settings, communicate with students, give items and teleport students in the Minecraft world. For videos and extensive documentation on Classroom Mode, head to our full set of [training materials](https://education.minecraft.net/trainings/install-use-classroom-mode-for-minecraft/).

  
**Can I code in Minecraft Education? How does it work?**

Yes, you can! Press "c" on your keyboard for it to launch. 

This allows educators and students to explore, create, and play in an immersive Minecraft world – all by writing code. Head here to a training that answers all your questions and get in touch with support if you need further assistance.

  
**Is offline usage possible?**

The only time you need to be connected is for logging in, accessing the Library, and [multiplayer](../Remote-Learning/How-To-Set-Up-A-Multiplayer-Game.md) games. Once you successfully login, you can play offline successfully until you close the app again. Then you'll need to login once again. 

 

**What are mods and will they be supported in Minecraft Education?**

Mods are modifications to Minecraft: Java Edition and available through a number of third-party websites. They can add or remove content to the game, or change how it is played. Community created mods are not currently supported in Minecraft Education.

 

**What is the difference between survival and creative mode?**

In survival mode, players have to gather all their materials to build, craft items and tools and gain experience points. There is a hunger and armor bar, an inventory and, when underwater, an oxygen bar. If you die you go back to your spawn point.

In creative mode the player has access to an infinite amount of almost all blocks and items available, and can destroy them instantly. Players are invulnerable and do not have health, armor, or hunger, and can fly. The player has access to items not available in Survival mode, e.g. spawn eggs.

 

**What is adventure mode?**

Adventure mode is a game mode intended for player-created maps, limiting some of the gameplay in *Minecraft.* In this mode, the player cannot directly destroy any blocks with any tools or place any blocks, in order to avoid spoiling adventure maps or griefing servers. Adventure mode is accessible only with commands.

 

**Can I use my custom skins in Minecraft Education? **

No. Minecraft Education Edition does not support custom skins for players or NPCs.

 

**Why can't I see my coordinates?**

In order to see your coordinates go to "settings" and toggle "show coordinates" on.

 

**How do I logout?**

You can close the game and each time a login will be required.

 

**Can I open worlds from Education in Bedrock or Java?**

Once a world has been opened in Minecraft Education it cannot be opened in Bedrock or Java
