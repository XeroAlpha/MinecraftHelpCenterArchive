MakeCode is a web application that users can select when they launch Code Builder. Usually the projects created will save to the machine you are playing on and will be there the next time you use MakeCode. There are a couple other alternative routes for saving your work in MakeCode:

### Save project to a file on the local machine

- Click on the gear on the project page, then select "**Save Project"**

- Give the project a name and pick a folder on the machine to save the project. (the file manager window can hang a bit…give it a little time)
- Select "**Save"**

### Import a project from a file

- Users can use this URL to import the project back into MakeCode

### Import a Published project using the MakeCode URL
