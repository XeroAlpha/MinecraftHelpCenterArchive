MakeCode is a web application that users can select when they launch Code Builder. Usually the projects created will save to the device you are playing on and should be there the next time you use MakeCode. There are a couple other alternative routes for saving your work in MakeCode:

### Save project to a file on the local machine

Click on the gear on the project page, then select "**Save Project"**

- Give the project a name and pick a folder to save the project. 
  - We recommend you save this file to your OneDrive folder so your projects can be available from any device and are not at risk of being lost on your local device.
- Select "**Save"**

### Import a project from a file

Note: Users on Mac, iPad and Chromebook cannot use the above process. They must use the below URL method.

- Users can use this URL to import the project into MakeCode

### Import a Published project using the MakeCode URL
