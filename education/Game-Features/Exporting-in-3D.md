**How it Works**

Build (or locate) an object you would like to export from Minecraft.

Change your world to creative mode (open the in-game menu, enable cheats, and change your personal game mode to creative), if you are not in creative mode already.

Type this command: “/give @p structure_block 1 0” without the quotation marks to give yourself a Structure Block. Open your inventory to gain access to the Structure Block (“E” key). Place the Structure Block on the ground near the object you would like to export by holding the Structure Block in your character’s hand, and put it on the ground. Right click on the Structure Block to access the menu.

Note that there is a fourth 3D Export mode available that you need to scroll down to access.

**Export a Structure**

Change the X, Y and Z values to define how much of the structure will be included.  You can see how much of your structure is going to be exported in the preview window.  You can also select the Detect button to have the system autodetect the boundaries of your structure.  

Set offset values to define boundary offsets from the location of the structure block.

When the preview window shows you the correct boundaries for your structure, select **Save** to save your structure in your world.  You can select **Export** to save your structure as a separate .mcstructure file.

If you don’t want to save your export locally, press the Cancel button to close the Save window.

You can then use the Load option to put this structure anywhere in the world where you created it!

 

**Load a Structure**

After you've exported a structure, you can load it anywhere in the world where you saved it.  Place a structure block on the ground, and then right-click to open the menu.  Select the **Load** mode and type the name of a saved structure from your world.  Click **Load** and then exit the Structure menu.

**3D Export**

In the Structure Block menu, scroll down to the **3D Export** mode.  Follow the previous steps to define your structure boundaries, and then click **Export**.  This will save the structure as a .glb file that you can import into other programs, such as 3D printing software.

You can also use the [Mixed Reality viewer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality) (Windows 10) to put creations in the classroom – or anywhere!

**Helpful hints**

- When putting data into the 3D export window you can only use positive numbers
- You will get an exported ,glb file. This means you must have a program that can open a .glb file
- Put the structure block one level below your creation
- Share your creations with us by tweeting [@playcraftlearn](https://twitter.com/PlayCraftLearn) and using \#3DMinecraftEdu

**Known issues with the Structure Block on iPad and Chromebook devices**

- iPads and Chromebooks do not support Exporting from Save mode.  The Export button does not appear in the menu while in Save mode.
- To export from an iPad, either use the 3D Export mode or export the world, transfer to a supported device, and then export the structure onto the supported device
- The .GLB files for structure blocks don’t open in other platforms when exported from a Chromebook.  To export from a Chromebook - export the world, transfer world to a supported device, and export the structure onto the supported device
