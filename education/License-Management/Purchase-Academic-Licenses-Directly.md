Qualified academic institution can purchase academic licenses of Minecraft Education through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. To purchase licenses, you need to have an academically qualified admin center account. If you do not have an academically qualified admin center account, you can set one up for free. This article provides information on how to:

- Check if you have an academically qualified admin center account
- Purchase licenses from the admin center

If you're eligible, it's free to set up an admin center account and does not obligate you to any subscriptions or purchases unless you specifically authorize them.

 

## Check if you have an academically qualified admin center account

Follow these steps to check if you are part of an eligible educational institution and have an academically qualified admin center account:

1.  Navigate to the [Office 365 Education](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office) page.
2.  Enter your school email address and select **Get Started**.\
    **Result:** The Office 365 Education page notifies you if you have an academically qualified admin center account, if you are eligible for an account, or if you are **not** eligible for an account.
    - If you are not eligible you can still purchase Minecraft Education through our [Commercial Licenses offer.](https://aka.ms/MEEFirstCommercialPurchase) 
3.  If you do qualify, continue the process to request Office 365 for your school organization.
4.  When you have received details about your new Microsoft Admin Center tenant, and you have been verified as academically qualified, you can purchase licenses in the Admin Center.

## Purchase and manage licenses in the Microsoft Admin Center 

Note that only IT Admins or staff that have been granted proper permissions are able to purchase through this platform.  Here's how:

1.  Sign into the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home) with your admin center IT Admin account credentials.
2.  Navigate to the [Minecraft Education product page](https://aka.ms/MEEDirect).
