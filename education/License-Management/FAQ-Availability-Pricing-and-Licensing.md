**Where do I buy it?**

The process for purchasing Minecraft Education depends on if you are part of an eligible educational institution or not. For more information on where you can purchase Minecraft Education licenses, see [Purchasing Options for Minecraft Education](https://aka.ms/MEEPurchaseOptions).

**Is it available on Chromebook?**

Yes! You can learn more [here](../Troubleshooting/Chromebook-Support.md).

**I see you have launched on iOS. Can I play Minecraft Education on my iPhone?**

Yes, Minecraft Education is available on iPhone and Android mobile devices.

**Can I purchase a school/server license?**

No. Unless licenses are bundled as part of your larger Enrollment Education Solution (EES), licenses are purchased at the individual level and assigned to individual Microsoft 365 accounts. It is not compatible with Servers.

**Do I need anything besides a Minecraft Education license to play?**

Yes, each user will need a Microsoft 365 account. For more information on how to purchase Minecraft Education licenses, see [Purchasing Options for Minecraft Education](https://aka.ms/MEEPurchaseOptions).

**What if the students don't have email address to assign licenses to?**

Minecraft Education licenses just need to be assigned to a user account in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. These accounts don't necessarily have to have email functionality. New accounts can be created in the admin center. Once these accounts are created under your tenant, then Minecraft Education licenses can be assigned to these accounts and they can be used to login to the game. For more information on creating accounts in the admin center go [here.](./Manage-Licenses-in-the-Admin-Center.md)

**Is Minecraft Education available in my country? What languages can I play in?**

If you have a suggestion for a new country or language, please post in our [community](https://edusupport.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics) to let us know you are interested and also please subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated for future availability.

**Who is eligible to purchase Minecraft Education? Are home schools eligible?**

Minecraft Education is available for anyone to purchase. For more information on how to purchase Minecraft Education licenses, see [Purchasing Options for Minecraft Education](https://aka.ms/MEEPurchaseOptions).

**Can I purchase Minecraft Education if I am a parent, student, or individual consumer?**

Yes you can! For more information on how to purchase Minecraft Education licenses, see [Purchasing Options for Minecraft Education](https://aka.ms/MEEPurchaseOptions).

**How much does it cost?**

If you are part of an eligible educational institution, Minecraft Education costs 5.04 US dollars per user, per year (or local currency pricing). If you are not part of an eligible educational institution, the cost is 36 US dollars per user, per year (or local currency pricing). To see the exact cost for your local currency and tax, have your IT Admin go to admin.microsoft.com, and add Minecraft Education licenses to your cart.  For more information on how to purchase Minecraft Education licenses, see [Purchasing Options for Minecraft Education](https://aka.ms/MEEPurchaseOptions). \

**Are there any discounts if I buy a large number of licenses for my school? **

School districts and municipalities with a [Microsoft Enrollment for Education Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/licensing-programs/licensing-for-industries.aspx) volume licensing agreement may add Minecraft Education to their agreement which will give them access across their organization, contact your local Microsoft representative or re seller to learn more. If you are not adding Minecraft Education through your EES agreement licenses must be purchased individually from the Admin Center.

**Are you providing discounts for underprivileged schools?**

Our current pricing levels are in line with many other educational software and services, and there is great value in having Minecraft in the classroom as a virtual maker space, replacing many alternative hands-on learning lab kits which are more expensive.

**Can I give copies of the software to my students to use at home?**

Students are able to use Minecraft Education at home by signing in using their Minecraft Education login as long as they are on a supported platform.

**If I have questions about COPPA, FERPA and CIPA as it relates to Minecraft Education and Office 365, where can I find this information?**

You can find that information right [here](../Get-Started/User-Privacy-and-Minecraft-Education.md).

**What if I want a refund?**

In order to process a refund you'll first need to ensure that all of your licenses have been reclaimed and are not assigned. Then you can process a refund by navigating to the "manage" tab. A complete guide can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription?view=o365-worldwide).

**Can I reclaim a license after its been assigned?**

Yes you can. Licenses can be assigned and unassigned to different accounts within the one year period. After you reclaim a license it can take up to one month for that user to lose access to the game.

**Can I use my Minecraft Education licenses to access a Minecraft Bedrock or Java server?**

Since each of these Minecraft editions use distinct licensing systems, it's not possible to login to a different edition with Minecraft Education licenses.
