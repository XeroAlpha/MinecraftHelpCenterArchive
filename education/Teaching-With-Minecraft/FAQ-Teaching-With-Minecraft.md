**What can I teach with Minecraft Education?**

Much like the game Minecraft, Minecraft Education is designed to be a versatile and open platform. By utilizing the digital platform and classroom experience, students can also develop skills in collaboration, problem solving, communication, digital citizenship, and more. There is no limit to what students can learn in the game, and no limit to how the game can extend classroom learning.

**Does Minecraft Education offer built-in lesson plans?**

A range of [Minecraft lessons](https://education.minecraft.net/class-resources/lessons/) are available for educators to use across subjects and age levels. Each lesson includes learning objectives, activities, suggested reflection questions, and evidence of learning criteria.

  
**Can a video game really be educational? Do you have any data to prove this is more effective than traditional lesson plans in the classroom?**

Video games are a great way to engage students and personalize lessons.
