This article will cover:

- Import
- Export
- Copy
- Delete

We recommend frequent backups of your worlds. The best way to accomplish this is through export and import. This is important to do not just periodically, but before you install or update your client.

Backing up your levels can help teachers measure daily progress, provide a way to “restore” a world damaged by error or mischief, and allow students to work on projects outside the classroom setting.

**Import**

1.  From the Minecraft start screen, click “PLAY"
2.  Click the icon that reads "IMPORT" on the Play screen
3.  Find the .mcworld file and select it to import.

**Export**

1.  From the Minecraft Education start screen, click “Play”
2.  Click "View My Worlds" to see all of your worlds
3.  Click on the world you want to export, and then click "Manage"
4.  Click “Export World” 
5.  Save the world to your location of choice. The exported .mcworld file can be placed anywhere (network drive, USB, etc.) to provide maximum flexibility.

**Copy**

1.  From the Minecraft Education start screen, click “Play”
2.  Click "View My Worlds" to see all of your worlds
3.  Click on the world you want to copy, and then click "Manage"
4.  Click “Copy” 
5.  This will create a copy of your world with "Copy of" prepended to the name. 

**Delete**

1.  From the Minecraft Education start screen, click “Play”
2.  Click "View My Worlds" to see all of your worlds
3.  Click on the world you want to delete, and then click "Manage"
4.  Click “Delete” 
5.  Confirm that you want to permanently delete the world by clicking "Delete."

**Additional Notes**

- Worlds from Bedrock can be renamed as .mcworld files and opened in Minecraft Education. Worlds created in Minecraft Education cannot be converted to Bedrock
- No special characters or punctuation can be used in world titles if you want to export
- If you open a world from a file picker on your device the world will automatically generate
- As of the 1.12 release work done with the book and quill can be exported into a PDF
- Steps to find Minecraft Education worlds can be [found here](../Administration-and-License-Management/Location-of-World-Files.md). 

If you have any issues, or cannot locate your worlds via this method, please [contact support](https://edusupport.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new) or post a thread in the [“Technical Support”](https://edusupport.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/360001721951-I-have-a-technical-problem) area of the forums.
