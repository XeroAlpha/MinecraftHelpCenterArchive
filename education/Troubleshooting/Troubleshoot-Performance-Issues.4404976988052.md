If you are experiencing low performance (choppy graphics, slow response) especially when joining or hosting multiplayer worlds, there are a few things you can check to try and increase performance.

- In a search engine, search “internet speed test” and check your network speed to ensure the number of players isn’t overloading your network.
- Make these changes to the Video Settings for the hosted world:
  - - Turn off Fancy Leaves
    - Turn off Render Clouds
    - Turn off Beautiful Skies
    - Turn off Smooth Lighting
    - Turn off Fancy Graphics
    - Decrease the Render Distance to 6
