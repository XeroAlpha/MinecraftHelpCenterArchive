This article provides information on Minecraft Education features that aren’t supported on Chromebooks. Refer to the [Chromebook Installation guide](https://aka.ms/meechromebook) for information about deploying Chromebooks to your organization.

 

## Proxy support isn’t yet available

Directing web traffic through proxies may function but is **not** currently supported or validated. You should verify all scenarios requiring proxies to see if they work in your network environment.

 

## Storage Requirements

On Chromebooks, Minecraft Education installs a separate installation per user on the device. Keep this in mind when considering storage requirements. View our [System Requirements](../Get-Started/System-Requirements.md) page for minimum space needed per installation. 

 

## Companion apps aren’t available

This table provides a list of companion apps that are **not** supported on Chromebook and a workaround.
