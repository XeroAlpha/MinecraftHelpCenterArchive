<li> In order to access Minecraft Education, you'll need to have a Microsoft 365 school or business account.   You can use this school or business account to access a free trial of Minecraft Education, and you can always try out a demo lesson without logging in.  </li>
<li>Read more:  <a href="../Get-Started/Try-Minecraft-Education-for-free.md">Try Minecraft Education for free</a></li>

<td style="vertical-align: top"><ul>
<li>Try syncing your system's clock. This is done differently per OS, but here are a couple examples:
<ul>
<li>Windows 10/11: Go to Windows Settings &gt; Time and Language &gt; Date and Time. Then, confirm that your time zone and region are right and hit the "Sync Now" button</li>
<li>iOS: Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Date and Time and flip set automatically off and back on. Also, confirm that the time zone is correct.</li>

<td style="vertical-align: top" width="312"><ol>
<li>Although you may see the account and be able to assign a license in the admin center, the user isn't an account in your tenant.  This can happen if you've created a guest account.</li>
<li>We recommend that you create a new account in your tenant for the user and assign a license to it.</li>
</ol></td>

<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top"><p>Commercial account is not correctly configured</p></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top"><ul>
<li>If you have recently purchased a license through our commercial subscription, you'll need to create users in the Admin Center and then assign purchased licenses to them.</li>
<li>When you first signed in and purchased Minecraft Education licenses, right before the billing info you would have created a new "business" email with its own @domain. The email address would look like this: <a href="mailto:EmailName@DomainName.onmicrosoft.com">EmailName@DomainName.onmicrosoft.com.</a></li>
<li>When you log into <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/">Admin Center</a>, you should see your onmicrosoft account cached if you use the same device that you used to purchase the Minecraft Education license. If you can remember the Domain name but not the email name part, let us know.</li>
<li>Here is the guide to purchasing and managing <a href="../Purchase-Licenses/Purchase-Commercial-Licenses.md">commercial licenses</a> that has more details about the full process.</li>
<li>If you're able to log into the admin center, this guide covers <a href="../Administration-and-License-Management/Manage-Licenses-for-Camps-Clubs-Homeschool-and-Other-Organizations.md">creating accounts and assigning licenses in the admin center</a>.</li>
