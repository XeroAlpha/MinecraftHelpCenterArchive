Uh-oh! You are probably here because something went wrong. If you got a message that something went wrong, it is generally because there is a URL you need to make sure is on your network’s allow list. This article provides information on how URL to allow to resolve this issue.

 

**Example message **

If you are seeing this after the 1.14.50 update it is most likely due to not having the following URL allowed on your network: https://\*.minecrafteduservices.com/. The [URLs Used by Minecraft Education](https://aka.ms/MEERequiredURLs) article has a list of all the required URLs.

 

If you have tried the solutions in this article and are still having issues, contact the support team via the [submit a request](https://aka.ms/MEE_New_Request) form and include this information:

- Which device and OS version you’re using
- Which version of Minecraft Education you are using (bottom right corner of the screen).
- A screenshot of the error.
