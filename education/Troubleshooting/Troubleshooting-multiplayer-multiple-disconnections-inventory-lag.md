## **Users begin disconnecting and/or unable to** **join after the host reaches a certain number of users connected. May be accompanied by in-game lag. **

<td style="width: 77.2857%"><p>After a certain number of users connect to the host (this number will vary based on host device specs), users in the world begin experiencing lag, inventory access issues, and/or disconnections. In addition, new users may be unable to join the host. This may be accompanied by in-game lag such as block place/destroy delay or a delay opening the inventory. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This issue tends to arise when the host device cannot handle processing all of the connected users in the multiplayer session. We tend to see CPU or RAM at 100% on devices before uses begin experiencing disconnections and lag. Once you've found how many players a device and its specs can handle, try hosting sessions with one or two less players for a better experience. </p></td>

<td style="width: 77.2857%"><p>Hosting with a fewer number of players can prevent the issue from happening in the first place. While we investigate what causes the increased performance requirements when hosting larger number of players, here are some things that can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure you're using the device with the highest specs to host the multiplayer session</li>
<li>Have the host lower their in-game video settings and close out of other apps</li>
<li>Try switching from wireless to a wired ethernet connection</li>
<li>Break into smaller groups for multiplayer sessions</li>
<li>Close other background apps on the host device</li>
<li>Update host device's OS &amp; drivers</li>
<li>Restart devices that haven't been restarted recently.</li>
</ul>
