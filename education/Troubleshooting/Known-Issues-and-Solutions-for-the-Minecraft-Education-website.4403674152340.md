## Using the same email address for your work/school (O365) and personal (MSA) accounts can create issues logging into the site

**Description**:  If you have used your work or school email address (Office 365) to set up a personal [Microsoft Account](https://account.microsoft.com/account), this can cause confusion when you log into the website for the first time.  The profile system may default to your personal account.  In some cases, you will be asked to create a new profile, and you won't be able to access your old profile, which you created with your school or work account.

**Status**: under investigation
