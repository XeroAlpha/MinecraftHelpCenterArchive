Oops! If you are seeing an error message saying that you can’t sign in with the email you provided, it is probably because the email address you used isn’t associated with a Minecraft Education license.

 

**Example message**

![Unable_to_sign_in_account_not_eligible.png](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/4404977207828/Unable_to_sign_in_account_not_eligible.png)  
  

If you are seeing this message, you are either trying to sign into Minecraft Education with a personal account (i.e. Gmail, Yahoo, or iCloud) or with an account that was not assigned a license. Contact your IT administrator to verify which email you should use.
