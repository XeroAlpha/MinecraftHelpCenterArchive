Any organization can purchase licenses for Minecraft Education, including eligible academic institutions, other organizations (like camps, clubs, and homeschools), and even individuals. This article provides information on how you can purchase licenses for Minecraft Education. 

 

## Two types of licenses

There are two different license types that you can purchase for Minecraft Education: Academic and Commercial. The difference between an Education license and a Commercial license is in purchase eligibility, price, and the process to purchase and manage licenses. The Minecraft Education game itself has the same features and functions regardless of the license type.

 

## Education license eligibility

Education licenses are **only** available to eligible academic institutions.  To see if your organization is eligible to purchase Education licenses, check your organizational email at the [Office 365 Education](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office) page. This article explains how to have your organization [reviewed for academic eligibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/verify-academic-eligibility?view=o365-worldwide).

 

## Purchasing academic licenses

Eligible academic institutions can purchase individual licenses for Minecraft Education directly from the Microsoft 365 admin center or can connect with a partner for volume licensing.

*Note: Check with your IT admins before purchasing licenses as your school may already be licensed for Minecraft Education.*

| **Option** | **Detail** |
| Direct buy | IT administrators can [purchase licenses directly from the Admin Center](./Purchase-Academic-Licenses-Directly.md).  |

## Commercial license eligibility

Any organization can purchase a Commercial license. This is the license option available to any organization (like a camp, club, after-school program, etc.) that is **not** an eligible academic institution. It is also available to individuals and homeschoolers.

 

## Purchasing Commercial licenses

Individual licenses can be purchased for use by anyone. See [Purchase Commercial Licenses](./Purchase-Commercial-Licenses.md) for more information on purchasing commercial licenses.
