This article provides information about deploying and using Minecraft Education on iPads and iPhones.

## Before you begin

Before installing Minecraft Education, ensure these prerequisites are met.

- Your iOS device must meet the system requirements, see [System Requirements](https://aka.ms/MEESystemRequirements).
- Users need to have the correct permissions based on the setup and installation method used at your organization.

## Deploying Software

Minecraft Education for iPad and iPhone is delivered via the Apple App Store, and guidance for deploying the software within schools can be found on the [Apple Support](http://help.apple.com/) page and the [iOS Deployment Reference](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment-reference-ios/welcome/web).

 

## Touch-based controls

Minecraft Education for iPad and iPhone uses touch-based controls that are functionally equivalent to the standard control scheme for the game. For a summary of how touch controls work in Minecraft, see [Bedrock Touch Controls](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Controls#Touch).
