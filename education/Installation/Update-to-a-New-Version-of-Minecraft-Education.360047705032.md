## Updating Minecraft Education on your devices

Windows PC:

- Desktop app (Windows): Will look for updates when a user logs into their computer as long as [https://downloads.minecrafteduservices.com](https://downloads.minecrafteduservices.com/win32/x86/updates/Updates.txt) is not blocked by your network.
  - Automatic updates can be blocked by performing the following:
  - Search for "Task Scheduler"
  - Select "Task Scheduler Library" in the left menu
  - Right-click "Minecraft Education Automatic Updater" in the list that populate
  - Select "Disable" from the context menu that appears
- Store app (Windows): Will give a store notification when the update is available. Automatic updates can be [configured](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15081/windows-turn-on-automatic-app-updates) in store settings

 

Chromebook:

Note: If a device does not auto update, it may be because your organization has blocked automatic updates. If you have install permissions, you can always download the latest version from our [download page](https://aka.ms/MEEDownloadPage).

 

## How to manually update

- [Back up your worlds](../Teaching-With-Minecraft/Import-Export-and-Manage-Worlds.360047555391.md) as they may be deleted when you uninstall your current version. Note that worlds are only deleted during a manual update, and not when you are auto-updated.

- Visit the [download page](https://aka.ms/MEEDownloadPage) to download and install the latest version
