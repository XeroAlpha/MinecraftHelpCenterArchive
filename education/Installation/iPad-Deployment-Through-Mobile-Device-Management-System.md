Minecraft Education can be purchased in bulk and then deployed using your preferred mobile device management system. This article provides information on how to deploy Minecraft Education to your organization's iPads.

 

To deploy Minecraft Education across a large-scale environment, you can use Apple School Manager.  For assistance with Apple School Manager, see [Deployment Reference for iPhone and iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment-reference-ios/welcome/web).
