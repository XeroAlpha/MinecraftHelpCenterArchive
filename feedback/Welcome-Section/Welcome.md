### **Welcome to the official Minecraft feedback site!**

Last update: 20 June 2019

We love listening to your feedback and suggestions. If you are looking for anything support or technical related, please visit [Mojang Support](http://help.mojang.com/) or [Xbox Support](http://support.xbox.com/). Bugs [go here](http://bugs.mojang.com/). We don\'t announce things here and updates on things in review are not guaranteed.

For general gameplay discussion or assistance please visit our official discord channels. They are here:  [discord.gg/minecraft](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/discord.gg/minecraft) - you can find people to play with, ask for help with your build, debug your redstone device, or just come on by and say hi.

### **Changes are coming to the Feedback site!**

[Please read our newest update about the website, located here.](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360043705892-Feedback-Website-Spring-Update-)

We are not accepting new layout suggestions or bug reports for the feedback site at this time, we are focused on our visual refresh. We appreciate everyone hanging in there with us and hope to share screenshots in the near future.

Remember, the best feedback:

\* Is short and includes everything you need to know.

\* Is easy to read. Posts using lots of bold and italics are not easy to read.

\* If you have a recipe, a picture **must be optional**. Screen readers will typically announce the image file name, the image URL, or the URL for the link destination, which isn\'t helpful for anyone. Thanks for your help with this!

\* Is respectful and doesn\'t copy old posts. People worked hard on those posts! Search first.

Enjoy!
