**Feedback Submission Terms of Use**

Thanks for your interest in Minecraft for Windows 10! We appreciate your enthusiasm and your willingness to share feedback. These "Terms of Use" are important, so please read them. They apply to your submission of comments, suggestions, input, ideas, feedback, or any related materials ("Feedback") through this website (the "Site"). These Terms are a binding legal agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation ("We" or "Microsoft"), and they are here, among other reasons, to make sure you understand what it means when you submit your Feedback, and so you have the correct expectations.

**License and Use of Your Feedback**

Microsoft makes a lot of different products and services, and we can't be obligated to you if something that we or Mojang creates resembles your Feedback. We are pleased that you want to share Feedback, but we also need to be clear about the legal issues.

When you submit Feedback, your Feedback is given for free and you are giving us rights to use the Feedback in any way we want. If you expect to be paid or do not want to give Microsoft these rights, do not submit your Feedback.\
Specifically, by making any Submission, you are granting to Microsoft full rights to use your Feedback as it sees fit, in any Microsoft product or service, without any obligation or restriction of any kind, including, without limitation, any obligation or restriction related to intellectual property rights, confidentiality, or contracts. When you submit Feedback, you grant to Microsoft a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, unrestricted license, including sublicense rights, to use, copy, distribute, publicly display and perform, sell, market, make available to the public, practice, or otherwise exploit and commercialize any and all of your intellectual property rights in any form and/or of any type that is or may at some future time be associated with your Feedback. So think carefully before you submit to us anything that is protected by intellectual property -- including patents, trademarks, copyrights, rights of publicity, or other IP -- because, by doing so, you are granting us an IP license.

We don't have any obligation to use or respond to your Feedback. We might use your Feedback, we might not use your Feedback, or we might do something (or have already done something) that seems related to your Feedback but which we created independently. In all cases, we will not pay you compensation or give you credit or be obligated to limit how we use or don't use the Feedback.

**Your Representations and Warranties**

You represent that you own or otherwise control any and all rights, including intellectual property, necessary for any Feedback you provide through this Site.\
Do Not Submit Confidential Feedback\
If your Feedback contains any confidential information or trade secrets, do not submit it. If you do submit to us any such secret information, it will not be secret any more and we do not have any obligation to keep it secret.\
No Liability and Disclaimer of Warranty\
We disclaim any liability that could arise from receiving or using your Feedback. You hereby release Microsoft and its employees, directors, customers and all others associated with Microsoft, including Mojang, from any past, present or future liability or obligation, related directly or indirectly, to the Feedback you submit.

The Site is provided "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. \$5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages. This limitation applies to:\
• Anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and\
• Claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.\
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

**Termination**

We have the right to terminate or suspend your participation in this Site if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you have breached these Terms, done something unlawful, or behaved inappropriately. We also have the right to shut down this Site without notice for any reason.

You understand and agree that your use of this Site is for providing comments, feedback, ideas and suggestions. No other use is permitted. You may not use this Site in any way that might harm the Site or anyone else. You may not use the Site to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account, or network by any means. You may not use the Site for any unlawful purpose.

**Additional Terms**

This agreement, and the terms for the party that hosts this Site, are the entire agreement for your use of the Site.\
Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.\
This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.
