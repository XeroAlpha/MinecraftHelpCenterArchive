Minecraft has entered The Copper Age! Express yourself in every shade of copper as you transform this versatile metal into handy tools, shiny armor, gleaming light sources, oxidizing decor, smart storage, and even lively mechanical companions known as copper golems. Whether scraped or oxidized, this is the start of a new clonking era of creativity! Unearth the power of copper in Minecraft now!

## Features and Bug Fixes

### Copper Chest

Copper chests are a new block! Summon a copper golem to get your first copper chest, which you can leave to oxidize, or keep pristine with wax. Drop items into a copper chest, and then sit back and relax as your copper golem sorts them into normal chests around your base!

- Copper Chest is a new type of chest that has waxed and oxidized variants
- Copper Chests oxidize over time and can be waxed like other Copper blocks
- Copper Chests can be crafted using a Chest and Copper Ingots

### Copper Equipment

What comes between stone and iron? Now the answer is: copper! Craft tools, weapons, and armor from copper, giving this early-game ore more uses than ever before. Unlike copper blocks, these items won't oxidize, but like all copper blocks - they will look beautiful!

- Copper armor has higher durability than leather but less than iron. Copper armor enchantability sits slightly lower than with iron
- Copper equipment turns into Copper Nuggets when smelted
- Hostile Monsters have a chance to spawn with Copper Armor equipped
- Hostile Monsters can pick up and use Copper Weapons and Armor
- Added Copper Horse Armor
  - Has the same loot table and chance of generating as Iron Horse Armor
  - Armor toughness: 4

### Copper Golem

Copper golems are handy, organization-loving companions that’ll bring your base to life! Summoned with copper and carved pumpkins, the copper golem removes items you leave in copper chests and sorts them based on the item type into chests around your base!

- Copper Golem will drop between 1 and 3 Copper Ingots when killed
- Copper Golem can help with sorting items into Chests
- If the Copper Golem has fully oxidized it will turn into a Copper Golem Statue Block
- When turned into a Copper Golem Statue block, it will freeze in a random pose
- When turned into a Copper Golem Statue the Copper Golem will drop any item it may be holding
- A Copper Golem turned into a Copper Golem Statue will keep its name if named with a Name Tag
- Interacting with the Copper Golem with an empty hand will drop its carried item
- Iron Golems will sometimes plant a decorative flower onto a nearby Copper Golem

#### Copper Golem Item Sorting

- If the Copper Golem is not holding an item, it will look for nearby Copper Chests to try to pick up an item
- The Copper Golem will look in any oxidized and waxed Copper Chest variant to pick up items
- It can pick up max 16 items in a stack at a time
- Any item in a Copper Chest can be picked up
- If the Copper Golem is holding an item, it will look for nearby Chests to try to place the item in
- The Copper Golem will look in Chests and Trapped Chests to try to place items
- It can place an item in a Chest if it's empty, or if it contains the same type of item it is holding in its hand
- The Copper Golem will visit max 10 Chests or Copper Chests in sequence to try to pick up or place an item
- If no matching chest is found the Copper Golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again
- The search area for chests from the Copper Golem's position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks

### Copper Golem Statue Block

- Copper Golem Statue Block is a new type of decorative block which has waxed and oxidized variants
- Copper Golem Statue Block oxidizes over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks
- The pose of the block can be changed by interacting with it
- If the Copper Golem Statue Block has no oxidation when interacted with using an Axe, the block will turn into a Copper Golem again
- When connected to a Redstone Comparator, the Copper Golem Statue Block emits a Redstone signal based on its current pose

### Copper Decorations

- Added Copper Torch
  - A green variant of the Torch crafted from a Copper Nugget, Coal, and Stick
  - Functionally identical to the Torch
- Added Copper Bars
  - Functions like the existing Iron Bars block
  - Made from copper and oxidizes over time
- Added Copper Chain
  - Functions like the existing Chain block (now renamed to Iron Chain)
  - Made from copper and oxidizes over time
- Added Copper Lantern
  - Crafted similarly to a regular Lantern but uses Copper and a Copper Torch
  - The lantern itself oxidizes, changing its look as it ages
  - Functionally identical to the Lantern

### Shelf

- The Shelf is a new type of decorative block which comes in the following variants:
  - Oak
  - Spruce
  - Birch
  - Jungle
  - Acacia
  - Dark Oak
  - Mangrove
  - Cherry
  - Pale Oak
  - Bamboo
  - Crimson
  - Warped
- The Shelf can be crafted from six matching blocks of any Stripped Log, Stripped Stem, or Block of Stripped Bamboo, filling the top and bottom row
  - This recipe produces 6 Shelves
- The Shelf can store up to 3 item stacks:
  - Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player's main hand item with the content of that slot
  - The Shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an Item Frame
- While a Shelf is powered by Redstone, its front texture changes to reflect that it's powered; when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered Shelves will connect
  - Interacting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player's hotbar
  - Interacting with two connected Shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player's hotbar
  - Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player's hotbar
  - It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with
- Shelf storage affects a Comparator's output signal depending on which slots are occupied ([MCPE-225226](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-225226))
  - Each Shelf slot corresponds to 1 bit
  - The signal strength is determined by converting the 3 bits of the slots into a decimal value
  - All slots empty \[000\] means a signal strength of 0
  - Only the first slot occupied \[100\] means a signal strength of 1
  - Only the second slot occupied \[010\] means a signal strength of 2
  - Only the third slot occupied \[001\] means a signal strength of 4
  - All slots occupied \[111\] means a signal strength of 7

    - "passenger"
      - Momentum applied from the dash action will now instead be applied in the view direction of the passenger entity, using the horizontal_momentum as forward momentum and vertical_momentum as upward momentum in the direction of the passenger. Short of it: looking up with horizontal momentum will launch you upwards.
    - Old schemas with format version older than 1.21.110 will automatically receive the "entity" direction

### Editor

We are excited to announce Editor v1.1.0! To learn more about Editor and its multiblock world editing capabilities, check out the documents [HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/bedrockeditor/?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable), or learn how to build an Editor Extension [HERE](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor)

#### Feature Highlights in Editor v1.1.0

##### Updated Flatten Tool

The Flatten Tool has been redesigned with new functionality and more flexible controls. You’ll now find a new Flatten mode within the Terrain Tool, along with two sub-modes: Flatten Up and Flatten Both, for better control over how terrain is leveled. New properties like FlattenSmoothing, FlattenIntensity, and FloorBlockOverride give you more customization. We’ve also added support for reading Cylinder Brush Shape properties (width, depth, height, radius, isUniform), and included the option to hide rotation controls. The previous version of the Flatten Tool has been removed.

##### Line node weights

You can now adjust the vertical and horizontal line weight for each node. This provides finer control over the thickness and shape of lines, making it easier to create more customized and organic-looking builds.

### Entity Components

- Fixed the documentation of minecraft:on_death claiming the component only works on the Ender Dragon, it works on all entities
- Added slot.weapon.mainhand and slot.weapon.offhand as valid slots for minecraft:interact component operations
- Changed the schema for the minecraft:experience_reward entity component so that the on_bred and on_death members no longer accept arrays; only single Molang expressions are now supported for each member

### Entity Event Responses

- Added the drop_item entity event response, which allows an entity to drop its item in a given slot

### Gameplay

- Fixed an issue where the player behaved incorrectly with the fixed boom camera when using the locked_player_relative_strafe control scheme. Player movement is now consistent with the free camera in this scenario
- From 1.21.110 onward, the free camera and fixed boom cameras use Camera Relative Strafe as default scheme
- Camera custom FOV command no longer requires the Experimental Creator Cameras experimental toggle

### General

- Models exported via Structure Blocks no longer use the missing texture for all block geometry ([MCPE-223559](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-223559))

### Graphical

- Changed defaults for color grading contrast and saturation fields to 1. Previously the defaults were 1.2 and 1.05, respectively

### Items

- Setting the "minecraft:use_modifiers" component's "movement_modifier" field to 1.0 now allows using the item while sprinting, and starting to sprint while using the item
- "poly_mesh" is no longer treated or documented as an experimental feature
- "texture_meshes" is no longer treated or documented as an experimental feature
- The "scale" field can now adjust the depth of "texture_meshes", since its value is no longer ignored
- Added the "use_pixel_depth" option to "texture_meshes" to control how geometry depth relates to texture resolution
  - If set to "true", the geometry will have a depth of one pixel (in entity space, not texture space)
    - This causes textures with a resolution different from 16x16 to appear stretched
  - If set to "false", the geometry will be built from perfectly cubic voxels, regardless of the texture's aspect ratio
  - Defaults to "true" to ensure backward compatibility
- Added Armor and Armor Toughness values to Armor tooltips ([MCPE-152962](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-152962))
- "poly_mesh" is now documented as a deprecated feature
  - It was already treated as deprecated, but the documentation did not reflect this
- "texture_meshes" is no longer documented as an experimental feature
  - It was already treated as non-experimental, but the documentation did not reflect this
- Fixed bug where custom Items' menu_category is_hidden_in_commands value was not sent to client and the items would show up in commands' autocomplete when they shouldn't.
- All items that can be eaten now have the tag minecraft:is_food, except glow_berries

### Item Components

- Repairing an item using the minecraft:repairable item component no longer fails when a stack larger than strictly needed is used as repair material
- Added the new minecraft:fire_resistant item component, which determines whether an item is immune to burning when dropped in fire or lava

### Mobs

- The minecraft:shareables component now also accepts item entries specifying item tags to name all items tagged as that to become shareable with the given settings

- Foxes now use the minecraft:is_food tag instead of listing all foods manually, except glow_berries which is still listed manually

- Fixed a bug where the minecraft:shareables component would mix attributes of duplicated entries in its items list. E.g. the priority would be taken from the first duplicated element and the max_amount from the last. Now the first "matching" entry will fully shadow those coming after it. Consider this items list in a minecraft:shareables using the new tag functionality:

  ``` auto
  "items": [  
    { "item": "minecraft:apple", "priority": 1, "max_amount": 2 },
    { "item": "minecraft:is_food", "priority": 0, "max_amount": 1 }]    
  ```

- Previously minecraft:apple would have had priority 1 but max_amount 1 instead of 2. Now it will correctly use all data from that first item apple entry.

### Molang

- Renamed query.is_cooldown_type to query.is_cooldown_category, to better reflect what it does

### Network Protocol

- Modified the binary format of PlayerArmorDamagePacket

### Block Components

- Modified minecraft:material_instances to support weighted variations textures with these requirements
  - **"format_version"** must be greater than or equal to 1.21.110
  - World must have **Upcoming Creator Features** experiment enabled
- Added new block component minecraft:flower_pottable
  - It is an empty component defined as such: minecraft:flower_pottable: {}
  - When the component is present on the block, \> a player can interact with an empty flowerpot when holding the block in order to embed it
  - Similar to other Vanilla pottable blocks, a player can remove the potted block by interacting with the pot with an empty hand
  - The component requires the Upcoming Creator Features toggle
  - Pottable not potable
- Added new block component minecraft:embedded_visual
  - The component has two required fields, "geometry" and "material_instances", similarly to minecraft:item_visual
  - When the component is present on the block, it defines which geometry and material_instances to use when the block is embedded into another block, eg. into a Flowerpot
    - If the component is not present, embedded blocks fallback to their innate geometry and material_instances
    - The component cannot be defined in the "permutations" section; only one embedded visual can be achieved per block type
  - The component requires the Upcoming Creator Features toggle
- Added new field embeddedto the item_display_transforms object
  - The field defines the overall transformation this geometry should be subject to when embedded into a block, eg. a Flowerpot
  - If the field is not defined, the default transformation is a 0.75x scale, similar to the one applied to most Vanilla flowers
