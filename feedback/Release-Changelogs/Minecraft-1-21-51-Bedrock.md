**Posted:** 11 December 2024

A new update has been released to address a few issues with the 1.21.50 release, as well as introducing an updated Play Screen.

# Bug Fixes and Features:

## General

- Fixed several crashes that could occur during gameplay
- The new Magma Cube model and texture are now only used by Resource Packs that explicitly override them, as they have been renamed to differentiate them from the original assets ([MCPE-188547](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188547))
- Fixed issue where some shaped recipes weren't parsing properly
- Fixed issue where legacy data driven block didn't apply the render layer from the material instances component

## Updated Play Screen

We’ve introduced a brand new Play screen!

- Worlds tab: Access your saved local and LAN worlds
- Realms tab: Easily jump into Realms you own or have joined
- Servers tab: Join multiplayer featured servers from our partners, and add or access your custom servers
- Create from template: Create from, and rate, your owned templates, discover Minecraft creator made content
- Friends: Connect with your Minecraft friends (they now live in the top right hand corner of the screen)
  - We would love to hear your feedback! Please let us know what you think at [feedback.minecraft.net](http://feedback.minecraft.net/) 

These updates are being rolled out incrementally, so they might not be available right away.

- **Known Issue:** When playing Hardcore worlds on a Realm, the world tag currently shows Survival instead of Hardcore. We hope to have this addressed as soon as possible!
