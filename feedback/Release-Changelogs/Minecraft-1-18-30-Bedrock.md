**Changes:**

**Updated *Create New World* Experience**

Create New World is being updated with improved navigation, more descriptions, and a new look and feel. It’ll be rolled out gradually across Android, iOS, Windows, and Xbox starting today.

![Create_New_World.png](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/5522357974541/Create_New_World.png)

We’re still working on some things, like support for other platforms, screen narration, the trial version of the game, and the Japanese language. We need some more time to work on these features in order to provide the best possible experience.

We would love to hear what you think! Share your feedback on [the Feedback Site](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/360000280611-User-Interface-Input-Methods-and-Menu-Options) and put “Create New World” in the title so we can find it.  
  

**Realms World Storage**

- We are cleaning up expired Realms that have been collecting dust. Realms that have been canceled for more than 18 months will be deleted. Find out more at [aka.ms/expired-realms-update](https://aka.ms/expired-realms-update)

**RenderDragon**

- The new Minecraft Bedrock rendering engine, RenderDragon, is now live on Android, iOS, Switch, and Windows 10 UWP x86 builds! Consolidating onto our new graphics engine will allow us to continue investing in future performance and stability improvements, as well as exciting new features for Minecraft!
- This technical update shouldn't impact gameplay or experience, but if you run into any new issues, please file feedback so the team can investigate

**Experimental Features:**

**Reminder:** Remember to **make regular backup copies** of your favorite worlds before enabling experimental features!

Please keep in mind that these features are work in progress, still under in development, and subject to change. If you activate them, your world might crash, break, or not work with future updates. Experimental features cannot be turned off after world creation.

For more information, please see the article about enabling experimental features at [aka.ms/MCExperimentalFeatures](https://aka.ms/MCExperimentalFeatures).

**Deep Dark Biome**

- Dimly lit and eerie, the Deep Dark is sure to strike fear into the hearts of even the bravest players

**Ancient Cities**

- Wander the halls of these long-abandoned structures in the Deep Dark depths to uncover relics long forgotten

**Warden**

- The horror of the Deep Dark! A creature with no eyes, roughly resembling the Sculk that can be found throughout the Deep Dark, the Warden is an unstoppable force of nature that inhabits this biome

**Sculk Blocks**

- A new variety of blocks that can be found in the Deep Dark

**Darkness Effect**

- A new mob effect unique to the Warden and Sculk Shrieker, which will afflict players with the effect when nearby

**Axe Changes**

- Attacks with Axes towards a raised Shield will disable the Shield for 5 seconds

**Spectator Mode**

- This update contains early functionality for Spectator Mode – a much-wanted feature we're adding to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. This will launch after the upcoming 1.19 update has shipped, but we’ll be testing it further in upcoming Betas and Previews. We recommend not relying on this in-development feature, which was not meant to be included in the release. We won't be accepting bug reports related to Spectator Mode until our first iteration is released, as the feature is likely to change during development.  
    

**Known Issues:**

- Teleporting entities into unloaded chunks removes them from the world. This will be fixed in an upcoming update

**Technical Updates:**

**Updated Add-On Template Packs**

- Updated Add-On templates for 1.18.30 with new resources, behaviors, and documentation, are available to download at [aka.ms/MCAddonPacks](https://aka.ms/MCAddOnPacks)

**RenderDragon**

- With the release of RenderDragon for Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, and Win10 UWP x86, HAL will no longer be available on these platforms. We know the community has found ways to build shaders on top of HAL and with this change, these shaders will no longer function. We understand that this is a valuable feature for players and the creator community, and we are working on how we may be able to deliver this sort of creative capability to players and creators in an officially supported way. While we have nothing to share right now, look out for more details in the future.

**Additional Modding Capabilities Experiment/JavaScript APIs**

- **Important!** In this release, we are removing the Additional Modding Capabilities experiment. This experiment contained experimental JavaScript APIs launched in 2018 – and with this removal, JavaScript within worlds associated with this API will no longer function. GameTest Framework – a separate JavaScript API – should not be impacted, nor should behavior pack/resource pack type add-ons more broadly.
- You can read more about this [via this article](https://aka.ms/mcamc).

**Changes**

- A world with "StorageVersion" 8 or lower will be increased to 9 and have its "RandomSeed" upgraded from using only the lower 32 bits of a 64-bit number to using the full 64-bit range while still representing the same number. This is only relevant for negative 32-bit seeds, which need a sign bit extension
- The world loading screen now shows progress when loading ticking areas marked for preload
- Experimental: Volume definitions are now stored and read from Behavior Packs instead of being part of the level directory
- Experimental: Added an optional "mob_amount" parameter to the Damage Event Response that specifies a unique damage amount when used by mobs
- Due to engine limitations, "minecraft:geometry" data used for blocks with the Holiday Creator Features experimental toggle are now restricted to only allow geometry in the \[0,0,0\] to \[15,15,15\] space. Any blocks loaded from Behavior Packs that exceed this limit will render as the info_update block and show a content error in the log
- The Interact component now has two new fields, GiveItem and TakeItem, specifying if it is possible to give/take items from an entities main hand slot. Taking the item also drops the inventory of the mob
- Removed *preventsjumping*component from data-driven blocks
- Removed *BlockImmovable*, *BlockBreakOnPush*, and *BlockOnlyPistonPush* components from data-driven blocks
- Limited the number of elements in the *crafting_tags*field of *CraftingTableComponent* to 64

**Commands**

- Fixed an issue that would cause commands to affect players in all dimensions ([MCPE-152218](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-152218))
- Added the "hasitem" filter for target selector of entities. This allows the player to target entities based on the items that have in their inventory or are wearing

- The '/tickingarea' command no longer modifies areas from entities with the *tick_world* component
- Entities must now be loaded for an area to be considered fully loaded and ticking

- Added '/loot ' command insert loot and insert kill overload

**AI Goals**

- Exposed new data parameter "calculate_new_path_radius" for GoHomeGoal. This is for specifying a distance in blocks that the mob is considered close enough to the end of the current path. A new path will then be calculated to continue toward home
- Added Knockback Height Cap value to KnockbackRoarGoal

**WebSocket**

- JSON format for events sent from websocket server and Code Builder APIs updated to hierarchical JSON format instead of flat format
- Less useful properties removed with block and item IDs moved to newer name-based format instead of numerical format
- Agent-based commands in websockets moved to new "action:agent" format, and all commands are now queued and include unique ids to correlate responses
- Any future breaking changes to websocket and Code Builder APIs will now result in the "protocolVersion" being incremented

**Molang**

- Molang expressions inside animation scripts for actor resource definition (pre_animation and initialize) that contain capital letters are properly evaluated now with format_version 1.18.20 or higher
- Clarified documentation for query.is_item_name_any that the slot index is required when there is more than one slot, i.e. the hotbar
- Fixed Logical AND to evaluate before Logical OR, and for comparison operators to evaluate before equality operators
  - This is a Molang Versioned Change that only takes effect for Molang expressions in packs that use a min_engine_version of 1.18.20 or higher
  - For example, *A && B \|\| C*now evaluates as *(A && B) \|\| C* and *A \< B == C \> D *now evaluates as *(A \< B) == (C \> D)*

**GameTest Framework (Experimental)**

New Module! We added a **mojang-minecraft-ui** module with API structures for creating simple dialog boxes:

- *Added* *ActionFormData/ModalFormData/MessageFormData* types in the mojang-minecraft-ui namespace. Documentation is available on [the Minecraft Creator documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/mojang-minecraft-ui/mojang-minecraft-ui).
