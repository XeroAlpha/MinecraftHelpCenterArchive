This hotfix is available only on Xbox One and Windows 10, as the fixes only apply to those platforms. It is still multiplayer compatible with other devices running version 1.7.0.

**Fixes:**

- Fixed several crashes that occurred during gameplay
- Fixed a crash that occurred when attempting to launch Code Connection with Minecraft for Windows 10
