**Posted:** March 19, 2024

A new update is now available to address stability issues introduced with the 1.20.70 update. The update is currently available on Android, iOS, and PlayStation 4, and other platforms will receive the update soon.

1.20.70 remains unavailable for Windows and we’re continuing to work on a solution. We’ll make an announcement as soon as the update becomes available again. We appreciate your continued patience as we work to address this issue.  
  

**Fixes:**

- Fixed several crashes that could occur during gameplay
