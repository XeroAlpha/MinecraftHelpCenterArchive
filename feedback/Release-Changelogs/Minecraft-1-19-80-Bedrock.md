# **Experimental Features:**

Even more experimental features are available in this update that are coming in the [**Trails & Tales**](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-trails---tales-update) update!

As these features are still incomplete, in development, and considered a work in progress, be sure to backup your worlds before enabling experimental features. The features can be enabled by turning on the “Next Major Update” toggle in world settings.  
  

## **Player Sneaking**

- The ability to sneak under 1.5 block gaps is now behind the “Short Sneak” toggle. Enable the toggle to continue to test out the feature while we continue polishing it
- Player’s hitbox height now reduces to 1.5 blocks while sneaking
  - Sneaking will automatically be initiated while stuck in a gap of less than 1.8 blocks
  - Sneaking will lower the player camera height respective of these changes
  - Sneaking now requires enough space to stand in order to exit sneaking state
  - Players will transition from swimming to sneaking if they are unable to stand up but would be able to sneak

## **Cherry Grove**

- Introducing the Cherry Grove biome, with pretty Cherry Blossom trees. You can find it in the mountains, like Meadows
- It has a new flower, Pink Petals, as ground cover, which can be crafted into Pink Dye
- Pigs, Rabbits, Sheep, and Bees spawn there
- Comes with a new wood set for the Cherry Blossom trees

## **Archaeology**

- Added the Trail Ruins, a buried structure from a lost culture
- Added Suspicious Gravel block, which has the same characteristics as Suspicious Sand
- Added Suspicious Sand to Warm Ocean Ruins
- Added Suspicious Gravel to Cold Ocean Ruins
- Added 16 new Pottery Shards (Now 20 Pottery Shards in total)
  - These have been distributed between the five Archaeology sites: Desert Wells, Desert Temples, Cold Ocean Ruins, Warm Ocean Ruins, and Trail Ruins

## **Armor Trims**

- You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
- Armor Trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits, and can only be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, and Boots
  - All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
  - To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
- An Armor Trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
  - The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
  - The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim
- The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your Armor Trim are the following:
  - Iron
  - Copper
  - Gold
  - Lapis
  - Emerald
  - Diamond
  - Netherite
  - Redstone
  - Amethyst
  - Quartz

## **Smithing Templates**

- Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
- Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Templates
- Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to equipment
  - It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
  - There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
- Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Template:
  - Pillager Outpost: Sentry Armor Trim
  - Desert Pyramid: Dune Armor Trim
  - Shipwreck: Coast Armor Trim
  - Jungle Temple: Wild Armor Trim
  - Ocean Monument: Tide Armor Trim
  - Ancient City: Ward Armor Trim
  - Woodland Mansion: Vex Armor Trim
  - Nether Fortress: Rib Armor Trim
  - Bastion Remnant: Snout Armor Trim
  - Stronghold: Eye Armor Trim
  - End City: Spire Armor Trim
  - Trail Ruins: Wayfinder Armor Trim, Raiser Armor Trim, Shaper Armor Trim, Host Armor Trim
  - Ancient City: Silence Armor Trim
- Smithing Templates are found in Chests in their respective structure, except for the Ocean Monument. Instead of finding it in Chests, Elder Guardians sometimes drop a Smithing Template when defeated
- Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
- Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
- You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 Diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 Smithing Template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template

## **Netherite Equipment**

- Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
- Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests, and there is a guarantee of 2 in every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant
- This change was made for a variety of reasons:
  - Increases the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
  - Make Netherite equipment a more significant achievement in the game's progression
  - Adapts Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

## **Calibrated Sculk Sensors**

- A new variant of Sculk Sensors which allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level. They are not found naturally and can only be crafted
- They can be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table
- One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a Redstone signal as input
  - The strength of that Redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to

## **Vibration Resonance**

- Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors
- If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location
- This behaviour is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally

## **Sign Improvements**

- Signs have improved customization options
- Sign text can now be edited after being placed in the world
  - This can be done by interacting with the Sign
- Both sides of the Sign can now have separate text and colors, allowing for further customization options
  - By default, a Sign will prompt you to input the front side's text when placed
  - To apply text to the back-side, you must walk to the other side and interact with that face to edit it
- Signs can now also be waxed with Honeycomb, preventing any further edits to its text

- Updated Add-On templates for 19.80 with new resources, behaviors, and documentation are available to download at [aka.ms/MCAddonPacks  
  ](https://aka.ms/MCAddOnPacks)

## **General**

- For behavior packs using version 1.19.80 and above, recipes no longer accept a Molang query for the item's data field, instead use the item's full name, eg. use { "item": "namespace:actor_spawn_egg" } instead of { "item": "spawn_egg", "data": "query.get_actor_info_id('namespace:actor')" }
- Fixed an issue that caused the InteractComponent to not work correctly while sneaking ([MCPE-168449](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168449))

- For worlds using game version 1.19.80 and above, acquiring a custom spawn egg through a command can only succeed with their full name rather than with an aux value, eg. "/give @s namespace:actor_spawn_egg"
- "fence" block is now split into unique names, "oak_fence", "acacia_fence", "birch_fence", "dark_oak_fence", "jungle_fence", and "spruce_fence"

                "translation": \[0.0, 0.1, -0.1\],  
                "scale": \[0.5, 1, 1.5\],  
      "rotation": \[90, 180, 0\]  
}

- Transformed geometries still have the same restrictions that non-transformed geometries have, eg. a maximum size of 30/16 units

## **Add-Ons and Script Engine**

## **Servers**

- Blocks can now optionally (via a setting in StartGamePacket) use a hashed value for their network IDs. This hashed value is independent of all other blocks and remains stable across future releases

## **GameTest Framework**

- Updated specific GameTest exceptions to be thrown as GameTestError error objects
- Added two new commands:
  - /gametest stopall - Used to manually stop all tests while they are running
