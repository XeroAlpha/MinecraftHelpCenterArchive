- Introducing Realms Saves, a new and improved version of our previous backup system. Keep your Realms worlds safe with a new bank of cloud storage included with your Realms subscription. Realms saves come in two flavors:
  - Automatic saves are functionally the same as our previous "backups" system:
    - They are on by default - no need to enable anything to keep your Realm world safe with automatic saves.
    - They are taken at the end of every Realms play session when the server shuts down, or every 30 minutes during a play session.
    - They are only retained for a limited time, according to our retention policy (which has not changed with this update): [How Mojang Saves Backups for Your Minecraft Realm \| Minecraft Help](../../help/Manage-Realms-Worlds/How-Mojang-Saves-Backups-for-Your-Minecraft-Realm.md)
    - They do not count towards your bank of cloud storage.
    - All previous Realms backups will be converted to automatic saves.
  - Manual saves are created by the Realm owner and count towards a bank of storage that comes with your Realms subscription.
    - Manual saves are retained as long as your Realm is. They are not automatically deleted by our retention policy\*, but Realm owners can delete manual saves if they want to free up storage space.
    - Realms Plus subscriptions come with 10GB of manual save storage and Realms core subscriptions come with 5GB.
    - Automatic saves can be turned into manual saves by the Realm owner.
  - Realms saves can be found in the Realms settings menu accessed via the "Edit Realm" button rather than the Realms world settings menu that backups used to show up in. While playing on the Realm, saves can also be found in the in-game settings menu for the Realm owner.
  - Realms saves will also now list the world name and the packs that were applied at the time of the save.

### Settings

- Fix suggested commands in chat misplaced when resizing window ([MCPE-147816](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-147816))

- Fixed a bug where the text to speech settings incorrectly auto enabled when starting a world
- Fixed the Social drawer lacking a border when opened within a world ([MCPE-227007](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-227007))
- Added a new joystick for touch controls when using the control schemes 'player_relative_strafe' or 'camera_relative_strafe'
  - The new joystick is only available with "Joystick & tap to interact" and "Joystick & aim crosshair"
  - Players who are using "D-Pad & tap to interact" when entering into one of the two control schemes will be put into "Joystick & tap to interact" and then returned to "D-Pad & tap to interact" after they stop using one of the two control schemes

- Added the "minecraft:behavior.use_kinetic_weapon" AI goal
  - Description:
    - Allows a mob to make use of items with a "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" item component
    - The mob will approach the target before using the weapon and charging with it
    - If the target gets too close, the mob will retreat and reposition before charging again

  - Fields:
    - "approach_distance": The distance to the target within which the mob begins using its kinetic weapon
    - "reposition_distance": The distance the mob retreats to once the target is closer than the midpoint of the item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component's minimum and maximum "reach"

    - "cooldown_distance": The distance the mob retreats to after all of the item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component's "max_duration" values have elapsed
    - "cooldown_speed_multiplier": Multiplier applied to the mob's movement speed while on cooldown
    - "weapon_reach_multiplier": Multiplier applied to the item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component's "reach"
    - "weapon_min_speed_multiplier": Multiplier applied to each "min_speed" and "min_relative_speed" condition in the item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component
    - "min_path_time": Minimum base time, in seconds, before recalculating a new attack path to the target (before increases are applied)
    - "max_path_time": Maximum base time, in seconds, before recalculating a new attack path to the target (before increases are applied)
    - "path_fail_time_increase": Time, in seconds, added to the attack path recalculation interval when the mob cannot move along the current path
    - "inner_boundary_time_increase": Time, in seconds, added to the attack path recalculation interval when the target is beyond "path_inner_boundary"
    - "outer_boundary_time_increase": Time, in seconds, added to the attack path recalculation interval when the target is beyond "path_outer_boundary"
    - "path_inner_boundary": Distance at which to increase attack path recalculation by "inner_boundary_time_increase"
    - "path_outer_boundary": Distance at which to increase attack path recalculation by "outer_boundary_time_increase"
    - "speed_multiplier": Multiplier applied to the mob's movement speed when moving toward its target
    - "require_complete_path": Specifies whether a full navigation path from the mob to the target is required
    - "track_target": Allows the mob to track its target even if it lacks a hard-coded sensing component

### Blocks

- Added component minecraft:support behind the Upcoming Creator Features toggle Example:

``` auto
"minecraft:support": { 
    "shape": "stair" // "fence" is also valid 
}
```

- Created a new block trait, minecraft:connection, to expose behavior like Fences or Glass Panes from Vanilla where blocks connect to other blocks around them. Using this trait with the example below adds the bool states minecraft:connection_north, minecraft:connection_east, minecraft:connection_south, and minecraft:connection_west. This is only available while the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle is enabled Example:

``` auto
{
    "format_version": "1.21.130",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "test:connection_block",
            "traits": {
                "minecraft:connection": {
                    "enabled_states": ["minecraft:cardinal_connections"]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- One known issue with this is that blocks using minecraft:connection don't properly decide connections to blocks like Fences, Walls, Iron Bars, Fence Gates, and Glass Panes. Addressing this issue is currently in development
- Added component minecraft:connection_rule behind the Upcoming Creator Features toggle which allows custom blocks to define whether other blocks with connection behavior - such as fences, walls, bars, and glass panes - can try to create a connection.
- Added VanillaBlockTag minecraft:has_fence_connections that can be used to identify a custom block as a block that creates connections like a fence; this tag is required to create connections between custom and Vanilla fences. The component and tag can be used along with the minecraft:connection block trait to make a custom fence that creates connections like a Vanilla fence. The following is an example of how they fit into the JSON of a custom fence block:

``` auto
{
    "format_version": "1.21.130",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "test:my_fence",
            "traits": {
                "minecraft:connection": {
                    "enabled_states": ["minecraft:cardinal_connections"]
                }
            }
        },
        "components": {
            "tag:minecraft:has_fence_connections": {},
            "minecraft:connection_rule": {
                "accepts_connections_from": "only_fences"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- Added new state minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction to the minecraft:placement_direction block trait which enables the minecraft:corner with values none, inner_left, inner_right, outer_left, and outer_right to provide similar behavior to how stairs in Vanilla work
  - When this is set, you can use the field blocks_to_corner_with to decide the criteria with an array of block descriptors to determine what blocks to form a corner with
  - The default behavior for this field is to corner with the same block name
  - This all requires the Beta APIs toggle to be enabled on a world and the use_beta_features flag on your block

``` auto
  "format_version": "1.21.130",
  "use_beta_features": true,
  "minecraft:block": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "custom:custom_block",
      "traits": {
        "minecraft:placement_position": {
          "enabled_states": ["minecraft:vertical_half"]
        "minecraft:placement_direction": {
          "enabled_states": ["minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction"],
          "blocks_to_corner_with": [{"tags": "q.any_tag('minecraft:cornerable_stairs')"}]
      }
  }
```

- With the Beta APIs toggle on, Vanilla Stairs have the tag minecraft:cornerable_stairs available, and can corner with custom blocks with the same tag if the block also uses minecraft:cardinal_direction block states
- Blocks using minecraft:placement_direction Block Trait with the minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction had the inner_left/outer_left and inner_right/outer_right states backwards when a block was facing south or west
- Made blocks that use the minecraft:placement_position block trait with the state minecraft:vertical_half and minecraft:placement_direction with the state minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction update the corner state immediately instead of happening a tick later
- We now will mirror the minecraft:corner block state when used within a structure
- Added minecraft:redstone_consumer component behind the Upcoming Creator Features experiment. A component describing how a block can consume and potentially propogate a redstone signal
  - Contains optional field min_power which defines the minimum value for incoming signal stregth. If signal strength is greater than or equal to this value then the onRedstoneUpdate event is sent to Scripts. Defaults to 0 meaning event is always emitted

  - Contains optional field propogates_power a Boolean to control whether a signal can pass through this block or not, defaults to false

  - This component is currently not available for block permutations

  - Example:

    ``` auto
    {
        "format_version": "1.21.130",
        "minecraft:block": {
            "description": {
                "identifier": "test:custom_consumer_block"
            },
            "components": {
                "minecraft:redstone_consumer": {
                    "min_power": 5,
                    "propogates_power": true
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
- Modified minecraft:material_instances block component
  - Removed redundant experimental field shaded formerly named emissive
  - Same effect can be achieved with existing fields, example below

``` auto
"minecraft:material_instances" : {
    "*": {
        "texture": "my_texture",
        "render_method": "opaque",
        "face_dimming": false,
        "ambient_occlusion", false
    }
}
```

- Added minecraft:leashable block component, which allows custom blocks to receive a lead attachment, including an offset field to change the position of the leash knot. Currently only available with "Upcoming Creator Features" enabled

### Editor

- Initial experimental support for "Prefabs" in the Editor
  - This feature is highly experimental, has some issues, is guaranteed to change and is not yet documented
  - Do not use in production projects
- Added a "Prefab Template Manager" to help create, edit and delete prefab templates
- Added a "Prefab Instance Editor" to allow placement of prefabs in the scene, and edit the properties of the instance

### Graphical

- Fixed an error where Marketplace content containing local_lighting.json could spam content errors ([MCPE-1498487](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-1498487))
