-   Fixed relative_block_has_all_tags block_neighbor_has_all_tags and biome_has_all_tags queries to require all tags rather than just any tags
-   Fixed nested conditional (ternary) operator parsing to go right-to-left instead of left-to-right
    -   This is a Molang Versioned Change that only takes effect for Molang expressions in packs that use a min_engine_version of 1.18.10 or higher
    -   Previously nested conditional expressions like \'A?B:C?D:E\'would evaluate as \' (A?B:C)?D:E\', now they evaluate as \'A?B:(C?D:E\'
-   Access of missing public variables on other entities will return 0.0 and not cause an error
-   Fix loading of public variables containing capital letters to not cause an error
-   Added \"slot.equippable\" added as a slot option for WearableItemComponent and Molang
-   Added alland query.any to check if a value matches all or any of the following values
-   Added in_rangeto check if a value is in the (inclusive) range between a min and max value

**Block Components (Experimental)**

-   Fixed BlockPartVisibilityComponent for multiplayer by adding network save/load tags ([MCPE-141908](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-141908))

**GameTest Framework (Experimental)**

There are some important breaking changes in APIs creators should be aware of:

-   Renamed mojang-minecraft:Worldobject to mojang-minecraft:world 
    -   In practice, this means "World.getDimension" code should now read "world.getDimension"
-   Removed mojang-minecraft:Commands- Instead, we are adding runCommand methods on dimension, entity, and player
    -   In practice, this means that "Commands.run("say Hello World", dimension)" should now read "dimension.runCommand("say Hello World")"

Other major API adds and updates:

**mojang-minecraft module**

World

-   Replaced function getPlayers() : Player\[\] with function getPlayers(options: EntityQueryOptions = undefined) : EntityIterator- Returns an iterator to a collection containing all players in the dimension. Optionally, options can be used to filter the result

World.events

-   Added blockBreak and blockPlace events, which are called when a player breaks or places a block in the world
-   Added optional argument to events.addEffect. This argument will limit the callback to only fire for specific entities (see EntityEventOptions)
-   Item use events:
    -   Added event events.beforeItemUse - Fires before an item is used. Can be canceled
    -   Added event events.itemUse - Fires when an item is used and the before event is not cancelled
    -   Added event events.beforeItemUseOn - Fires before an item is used on a block. Can be cancelled
    -   Added event events.itemUseOn - Fires when an item is used on a block and the before event is not cancelled\
        \
-   Note that the following definition events only function with data driven items created as part of the Holiday Creator Features experiment:
    -   Added event events.beforeItemDefinitionEvent - Fires before an Item definition event is processed. Can be canceled
    -   Added event events.itemDefinitionEvent - Fires when the Item definition event is processed and the before event is not canceled
