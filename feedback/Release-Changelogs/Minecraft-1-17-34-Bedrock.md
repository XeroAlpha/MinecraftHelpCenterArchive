**Posted:** October 5, 2021

A new Minecraft update is available to address issues with redeeming codes. We're rolling this update out to each platform as they become available so if you haven't received the update, it will release over the coming days. Multiplayer is still compatible with platforms running other non-beta versions of 1.17.

**Fixes:**

-   Fixed an issue with owned content not appearing in the inventory after redeeming a retail code
