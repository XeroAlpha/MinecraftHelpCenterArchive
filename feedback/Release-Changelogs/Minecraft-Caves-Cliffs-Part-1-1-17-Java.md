It's here. The Cave Update, with a side of cliffs. That's right, The Caves & Cliffs Update: Part I is launching today!

Now you can finally swim with the glow squid, fight alongside the axolotls, and get rammed off a mountain by a goat. You can also build with new blocks like copper, pointed dripstone, and moss, hang some hanging roots and cave vines, and marvel at the new ore textures. Light up your homes, caves, mineshaft and lives with the glow berry. Build a spyglass and peep your next adventure or just keep track of what that creeper over yonder is doing. Wait, what is it doing? Is it getting closer, or is this spyglass just really good?

Have fun with Part I!.

## AMETHYST BLOCKS

-   Amethyst comes in block form inside the Geodes in two ways: Block of Amethyst and Budding Amethyst
-   All types of Amethyst blocks (Clusters included) create beautiful sounds when you walk on them, break them, place them, or hit them with a projectile -- go make some music!

## AMETHYST CLUSTERS

-   Amethyst Clusters grow from Budding Amethyst, which can be found inside Amethyst Geodes
-   Clusters have four growth stages: Small Amethyst Bud, Medium Amethyst Bud, Large Amethyst Bud, and Amethyst Cluster
-   Clusters can only grow when they are placed on Budding Amethyst blocks

-   Axolotls love tropical fish! Bucket of Tropical Fish can be used to breed Axolotls.
-   Axolotls will swim around with you if you're holding a Bucket of Tropical Fish in either hand
-   When a player kills a mob that the Axolotl was attacking or being attacked by, the Axolotl will show its appreciation by granting the player temporary Regeneration and removing any Mining Fatigue effects
-   If the player has more than 2 minutes of Regeneration effect left already, the axolotl will not grant additional regeneration
-   You can pick up your Axolotl in a Water Bucket and carry it around just like a Salmon or a Cod!
-   Axolotls will always chase after and attack Squids, Glow Squids, Tropical Fish, Cod, Salmon, Pufferfish, Drowned, Guardians, and Elder Guardians
-   Axolotls do not like being out of water, and will dry up and begin taking damage if they are out of water for longer than 5 minutes
-   An Axolotl will not dry up as long as they are in water or rain
-   Sometimes when an Axolotl takes damage while inside water, it will pretend to be dead so that it stops being attacked
-   There are four common varieties and one rare variety (blue) of Axolotl
-   Axolotls spawn in underground water sources that are in total darkness and above natural stone blocks

-   Candles can only be placed if there is a solid surface below but will remain even if the surface below is removed

## CAULDRONS

-   Cauldrons can now be filled with Lava and Powder Snow Buckets!
-   Cauldrons filled with lava give off a Redstone signal with Strength 3 when used with a comparator

-   Smelt Copper Ore to get a Copper Ingot
-   Copper Ore drops 2-3 Raw Copper

## DEEPSLATE

-   Deepslate can be found in the deepest parts of the underground, and is slightly tougher to mine than normal Stone
-   Deepslate will drop Cobbled Deepslate, similar to how Stone drops Cobblestone
    -   You can still obtain Deepslate with Silk Touch
-   Like Cobblestone, Cobbled Deepslate can be used to craft basic tools, Furnaces and Brewing Stands
-   You can also craft the following blocks with Deepslate:
    -   Cobbled Deepslate Slab
    -   Cobbled Deepslate Stairs

-   Twice as tough to mine as normal ores

## DRIPSTONE BLOCK

-   Decorative block
-   Can be crafted with four Pointed Dripstone

## POINTED DRIPSTONE

-   Forms a stalactite if placed on the ceiling or a stalagmite if placed on the floor
-   Can be combined to form longer stalactites & stalagmites
-   Stalactites and stalagmites merge if the tips are next to each other unless you press shift while placing
-   Stalagmites will break if they're not attached to something below
-   Landing or jumping on a stalagmite hurts! They are sharp
-   Stalactites fall down if not attached to something above
-   Being hit by a falling stalactite hurts! They are sharp
-   Stalactites drip water (or lava if there is lava above the ceiling)
-   A stalactite with a water source above the ceiling will gradually fill a cauldron below with water
-   A stalactite with a lava source above the ceiling will fill a cauldron below with lava after a while
-   Thrown Tridents break Pointed Dripstone

## DRIPSTONE GROWTH

-   If a stalactite is hanging from a Dripstone Block with a water source above, it will slowly grow both the stalactite from above and a stalagmite from below
-   Growth speed is random but very slow, a single growth step can take several Minecraft days
-   A stalactite will only grow up to seven blocks long
-   A stalactite will only cause stalagmite growth if the floor or stalagmite below is within 10 blocks
-   If the stalactite tip is inside water it won't drip, and therefore won't trigger any growth
-   If the stalagmite tip is inside water it won't receive drops, and therefore won't be grown by a dripping stalactite. Same thing if there is any fluid between the two tips.
-   A stalagmite or stalactite will never grow into a fluid

## GLOW LICHEN

-   A dim light source that generates in caves
-   Use Shears to pick it up
-   Use Bone Meal to spread it along block surfaces

## GLOW SQUID

-   Glow Squids are well-lit and can be seen from far distances

-   Use an Ink Sac on a Sign to remove the glow effect
-   Axolotls will attack any Glow Squids they see, so... be careful
-   Glow Squids spawn in underground water that is in total darkness with Stone, Granite, Diorite, Andesite, Tuff, or Deepslate below

-   Screaming Goats will use their ram attack more often than other Goats will
-   Mobs rammed by Goats do not retaliate

## INFESTED BLOCKS

-   Infested Blocks are no longer instantly destroyed, and instead, have half the destroy time of their non-infested counterpart

## LIGHTNING ROD

-   A Lightning Rod is crafted from three Copper Ingots
-   Keeps your builds safe (well, as long as the closest area around the Lightning Rod is fireproof) during thunderstorms!

-   The Wandering Trader will sometimes sell Small Dripleaf plants
-   Small Dripleaf grows into Big Dripleaf when bonemealed
-   Big Dripleaf grows taller when bonemealed
-   If you stand on a Big Dripleaf, it will tilt after a while, and you will fall off
-   A tilted Big Dripleaf will tilt up again after a while
-   A Big Dripleaf will tilt when hit by a projectile
-   A Redstone powered Big Dripleaf will not tilt (except when hit by a projectile)

## OXIDATION

-   Copper will oxidize over time
-   There are four stages: Copper, Exposed Copper, Weathered Copper, and Oxidized Copper
-   It takes 50-82 Minecraft days (in loaded chunks) for a Copper Block to oxidize one stage
-   Waxed Copper Blocks will not oxidize
-   You can wax any oxidation stage -- how lovely, that means you can keep that pretty Weathered Copper Block in its weathered stage forever!
-   A lightning strike hitting Copper will clean its oxidation
-   Waxed Copper Blocks can be crafted into nine Copper Ingots
-   Axes can scrape off wax and oxidation from Copper Blocks

## POWDER SNOW

    -   Common activators
    -   Openables
-   Slime Blocks and Honey Blocks have been moved to the Redstone tab

## SMELTABLE ORE DROPS

-   Ores that are smeltable now drop raw item forms of the ore instead of the ore block, and these can be smelted just like before

-   Just like other ore materials, you can craft a compact version with raw ore items in order to save inventory space

## SMOOTH BASALT

-   Smelt Basalt to obtain Smooth Basalt

## SPYGLASS

    -   an effect is removed

### LIGHTNING BOLT

-   blocks_set_on_fire - a range check for blocks set on fire by this entity
-   entity_struck - a predicate for entities struck by this lightning bolt (if present, must match one or more)

### NEW TRIGGERS

-   Triggers for any player within a certain radius of a lightning strike
-   Conditions
    -   player - a player for which this trigger runs

    -   {\"selector\": \"@e\[type=chicken\]\", \"separator\": \"\|\"}
    -   {\"nbt\": \"CustomName\", \"entity\": \"@e\[type=chicken\]\", \"interpret\": true, \"separator\": {\"text\": \"\*\", \"color\": \"red\"}}

## COMMANDS

### ITEM

Modifies the item or block inventory.\
This command has three forms:\
Possible sources and targets:\
For example, /item replace block \~ \~ \~ container.0 from entity \@s enderchest.0 will copy the first item from the player's Ender Chest to the first slot of a container that the player is currently standing on.

-   /item replace \<target\> with \<item stack\> \[\<count\>\] - the same as old replaceitem
-   /item replace \<target\> from \<source\> \[\<modifier\>\] - copies an item for source to target(s), optionally applying a modifier
-   /item modify \<target\> \<modifier\> - modifies an item (without copying)
-   entity \<selector\> \<slot\>
-   block \<x\> \<y\> \<z\> \<slot\>

## CUSTOM SERVER RESOURCE PACKS

-   A dedicated server can enforce custom resource packs by setting require-resource-pack in server.properties
    -   When this option is used, players will be prompted for a response and will be disconnected if they decline the required pack
    -   If user has a setting to automatically decline packs, the prompt will still be shown (since the alternative would be automatic disconnection)
-   A dedicated server can also configure an additional message to be shown on the resource pack prompt (resource-pack-prompt in server.properties, expects chat component syntax, can contain multiple lines)
    -   This message won't be shown if user has already declined pack and it's not required

-   Those new files are still region files with NBT

## ITEM MODIFIERS

-   The function part of loot tables can now be defined as a separate data pack resource in the item_modifiers directory
-   This type of file can contain a single function (i.e single JSON object) or an array of functions

## JAVA 16

Minecraft now uses a more recent version of Java. If you are using a default setup, the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup, or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 16 or above.

## LIGHT BLOCK

-   Op-only (/give), air-like, waterloggable block
-   Emits light at a level that is determined by block state

-   value - see "New value providers" section (currently a combination of random generators and score)
-   range - min/max range

### NEW FUNCTIONS

#### SET_BANNER_PATTERN

Sets tags needed for banner patterns.\
Parameters:

-   patterns - list of pattern objects:
    -   pattern - the name of the pattern (square_bottom_left, bricks, etc.)
    -   colour - the name of the colour (light_gray, etc.)
-   append - if true, the new elements will be appended to the existing ones instead of replacing them

#### SET_ENCHANTMENTS

Modifies enchantments on an item.

##### Parameters

-   enchantments - map of enchantment id to level value (can be a score or a random number)
-   add - if true, the change will be relative to the current level. If false, the level will be replaced with the current value (default behaviour)

### NEW VALUE PROVIDERS

Note: value providers can be used in same places as random number generators.

#### SCORE

Returns scaled scoreboard value.

##### Parameters

-   score - scoreboard name
-   target - see below
-   scale - scaling factor (float)

##### Scoreboard provider targets

-   \<target\> or {\"type\": \"context\", \"target\": \<target\>} where \<target\> can be one of this, killer, direct_killer, killer_player (not all may be available depending on context)
-   {\"type\": \"fixed\", \"name\": \"\<scoreboard name\>\"} for fixed scoreboard name (may be fake player)

## MARKERS

Markers are a new type of entity that is meant for custom use cases like map-making and data packs.

-   Only exist on the server-side, and are never sent to clients
-   They do not do any updates of their own
-   They have a data compound field that can contain any data

## OPENGL

Rendering is now using OpenGL 3.2 core profile. All fixed-function rendering has been replaced with shader-based rendering.

### SHADERS

Shaders are now included for all supported render states. Any shader, except for the blit shader, can also be replaced in resource packs. For now, replacing these shaders is not officially supported, and the way it works may change in the future.\
The current rendering engine uses a system similar to the post-processing shader pipeline. There are some differences between both systems that cater to the slightly different requirements.

## PARTICLES

-   Added new particle types called vibration and dust_color_transition

## PERFORMANCE METRICS REPORTING

These will be saved to a zip file in debug/profiling/\<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss-\[levelname\]-\[version\]\>.zip and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.\
The exact metrics, output format, and names are susceptible to change between versions. Our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

### CLIENT F3+L SHORTCUT

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds, which captures metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes, and other more detailed stats.\
Pressing F3+L before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.\
This shortcut is always available to clients, even on multi-player servers where it will record client-side performance.

### DEDICATED SERVER PERF START/STOP COMMAND

-   perf start will start a recording for 10 seconds, which captures metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes, and other more detailed stats
-   perf stop before the 10-second limit will end the recording early

## RESOURCE PACKS

Changes to resource packs for version 7:

-   Drowned texture mirroring has changed (see [MC-174685](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-174685))
-   The slots for the Game Mode Selector are now 26 pixels instead of 25

## SERVER PROPERTIES

-   Removed max-build-height

## STATISTICS

-   The statistic for play time has been renamed to play_time
-   There is now a statistic for "Time with World Open" (total_world_time) that also includes time when the game was paused
