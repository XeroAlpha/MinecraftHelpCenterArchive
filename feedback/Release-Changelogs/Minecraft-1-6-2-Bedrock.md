Minecraft 1.6.2 is a hotfix to address several crash issues that affected the game exclusively on iOS devices. This update is only on iOS and is multiplayer compatible with devices running Minecraft 1.6.1

# Fixes:

- Fixed the cause of three crashes that could occur during gameplay.
- Fixed a crash that occurred when spawning high amounts of Creepers, Rabbits, Villagers, and Wolves in a small area.
