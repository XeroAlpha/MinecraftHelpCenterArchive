**Posted:** 22 October 2024

Today marks the launch of our third game drop: Bundles of Bravery! Featuring space-saving bundles and the hardest Survival mode out there (Hardcore mode!) this drop is all about embarking on a new adventure, collecting everything you can along the way, and definitely *not* dying. Given Hardcore mode brings hardcore stakes, we really can’t recommend backing up your Hardcore worlds enough – especially if you’ll be playing the new drop on low internet speeds (Read more about these bugs [here](#hardcore-mode-1)!). If that wasn’t enough stuff to stuff into a changelog, we’ve also fixed over 140 bugs, increased the spawn rate for bats above ground (because they’re cute, and more players should see them) and made a heap of technical changes for creators. Goodness, that was a lot, wasn’t it! Perhaps I should’ve stuffed it all into a bundle?

# Features and Bug Fixes

## Hardcore Mode

A new game mode for Bedrock Edition!

- You can't turn off Hardcore mode after creating this world
- The game is locked to the highest difficulty
- There are no second chances. If you die, it's game over!
- Upon death, you can only respawn as a spectator. You can still explore your world and watch others, but you’ll no longer be able to interact or rebuild

> ***Developer's Note:** We’re confident that Hardcore mode will run smoothly for most Bedrock players, but we’re still working on quashing some smaller bugs. Two of these impact multiplayer gameplay – one related to low internet speeds, and another when replacing a Creative mode Realm with a Hardcore mode world. While we develop a fix for these final bugs, we recommend all players regularly back up their worlds and check below for more detailed information on factors that might trigger them.*

## Bundles

A Bundle is an item that lets you stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot. Different items normally don’t stack together, so you can end up wasting space by only having a few items in each slot. A Bundle lets you pack those items together so there is no wasted space.

- A Bundle is an item that can pack different items together into the same stack
- A Bundle only fits one stack (usually 64 items) but it can be a mixture of many different item types
- You can insert items into a Bundle directly in the inventory
- Bundles have a tooltip that shows the items inside
  - If a Bundle has less than 12 item types inside, the tooltip will show all of them
  - Otherwise, the tooltip will show the top three rows of items and the others will be hidden below
- You can select any of the visible items to pull out of the Bundle
  - Use the scroll wheel on mouse, the right stick on a game controller, or tap on a touch device
- When selecting an item to remove, the Bundle icon shows that item poking out of the Bundle
- When holding a Bundle in hand, you can empty it onto the ground
- The Bundle is crafted with one String above one Leather

> **Developer's Note:** *The original prototype for Bundles was much more expensive to craft and used Rabbit Hide, which is only available in certain biomes, so the player had to explore to get their first Bundle. In this version we've made it cheaper and something that you can craft at home in almost any biome. We want it to be easy to get Bundles in a new world so you can use it in your early adventures.*

## Accessibility Features

- Trial Spawner hit sounds now play at their intended volume
- Fixed an issue with shipwrecks only generating lower-slabs. (This fix will not alter already generated shipwrecks) ([MCPE-186235](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-186235))
- Updated references to old block names in behavior pack wood recipe files
- Updated references to old block names in remaining behavior pack recipe files

## Commands

## Creative Inventory Changes

> **Developer's Note**: Items and blocks in the creative inventory have been reorganized, with the goal of making overall sorting more intuitive.

- Trial Chamber items
  - Trial Keys were moved to be next to Ominous Trial Keys, very ominous ([MCPE-180280](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180280))
  - Ominous Bottles were moved next to the existing Potions and were made into its own "Ominous Bottle" group ([MCPE-180278](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180278))

  - Reordered Raw Iron, Raw Copper, Raw Gold to Raw Copper, Raw Iron, Raw Gold
  - The Copper, Iron, and Gold blocks were moved to match the Raw versions ordering
  - The Copper Doors were moved to all the other Doors

  - Rooted Dirt is now next to the other Dirt blocks
  - Many Dirt blocks and Grass variants were shuffled around to match Java Edition

  - Clay was moved from the Construction Category to the Nature Category, placed next to the Mud Block

## Gameplay

- Wind Charges can't be hit and redirected shortly after throwing them
- Interacting with a Bed now sets it as the respawn point regardless of nearby enemies ([MCPE-152134](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-152134))
- Hardcore mode is now fully released. This mode locks player's game mode to Survival, locks difficulty to hard, and disables cheats. Players only have one life in Hardcore mode, if you die, you cannot respawn, only spectate
- Players hitting the edge of the generated world will keep their velocity. Example: While flying with the Elytra, the player will stay floating instead of losing all speed instantly
- Fixed a bug where Oozing, Weaving, and Wind Charged effects did not apply on player's death ([MCPE-180640](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180640))

- Players getting killed by the Mace's Smash Attack now get the correct death message ([MCPE-185952](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185952))
- Fixed an issue that could prevent the player from respawning correctly ([MCPE-186324](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-186324))
- TNT explosions no longer reset momentum of other falling Primed TNTs. This should fix any issues that were occurring with TNT cannons ([MCPE-181055](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-181055))

## General

- Added Minecraft for PlayStation®5, an enhanced version of the game for PlayStation®5 users that better utilizes the hardware for smoother performance

## Graphical

- Addressed an issue where the game would show pink on iOS when using Large Zoom ([MCPE-174398](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-174398)) ([MCPE-185373](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185373))
- Data driven items are no longer misplaced in screenshots ([MCPE-185132](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185132))

## [Hardcore Mode](#hardcore-mode-1)

Here are some of the bugs that we've fixed that could be especially troubling when playing in Hardcore mode!

- Fixed an issue where End Gateway Portals could teleport some players incorrectly ([MCPE-66061](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-66061))
- Fixed a bug that could sometimes cause the player to get pushed when pillaring up ([REALMS-9874](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/REALMS-9874))
- Fixed issues with taking random fall damage ([MCPE-120140](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-120140) , [MCPE-136406](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-136406))

**Known Issues:** These are some of the issues that may rarely occur, and may be worse when playing on a world with a slow connection

- Rain/snow sometimes does not visually match the actual weather ([MCPE-131325](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-131325))
- Blocks sometimes disappear when placed ([MCPE-112420](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-112420))

**Known Realms Issue:**

- Replacing an existing Realms Creative world with a Hardcore world, or vice versa, may corrupt some world settings for the newly-uploaded world. It is safest to only replace a Survival mode world with a Hardcore mode world to avoid this issue.

- Updated the rules under which Bats spawn in the world:
  - Bats can now spawn at any height, provided the area is covered and sufficiently dark

From this point on you can keep building in your worlds, and your Marketplace purchases (including Minecoins) will continue to be available on a non-VR/MR graphics device such as a computer monitor. You will no longer be able to use your VR/MR device with Minecraft as it will no longer be supported in the latest updates.

## Components

- The "restriction_type" field has been added to the "minecraft:home" component, allowing to define how an entity is restricted to its home position:
  - Its values are:
    - "none", which poses no restriction
    - "random_movement", which restricts randomized movement around the home position
    - "all_movement", which restricts any kind of movement around the home position
  - The "all_movement" value is currently in \[Beta\] and is planned to be fully released at a later date
  - Entities that have moved too far from their home will always be able to move closer to it if prompted
  - The radius of the restriction is still specified with "restriction_radius"
  - Entities with a format version prior to 1.21.40 will be upgraded to use the new field in a way that preserves their existing behavior
- Added the "minecraft:dimension_bound" component, which prevents entities from changing dimension through portals 
  - In Vanilla content, this is used by the Ender Dragon, the Fishing Hook, and some projectiles
- Added the "minecraft:transient" component, entities with this component will never be saved. In Vanilla content, this is currently used for the Fishing Hook
- Renamed the "minecraft:lookat" component to "minecraft:looked_at" to better reflect its functionality
  - Its "look_event" field was also renamed to "looked_at_event"
  - Its "look_cooldown" field was also renamed to "looked_at_cooldown"
- Expanded the "minecraft:looked_at" component functionality with the addition of six new \[Beta\] fields: 
  - "find_players_only" restricts the search for entities looking at the owner entity to Players only, ensuring that the closest Player satisfying the specified "filters" is selected
  - "look_at_locations" defines the parts of the owner entity that are targeted for being looked at
    - For these parts, a line-of-sight check is performed to ensure no blocks obstruct the view
    - Supported values are "head", "body", and "feet"
  - "not_looked_at_event" specifies the event to trigger when no suitable entity is looking at the owner entity
  - "field_of_view" defines the width of the field of view, in degrees, for entities looking at the owner entity:
    - If "scale_fov_by_distance" is set to true, this value corresponds to the field of view at a distance of one block between the entities
  - "scale_fov_by_distance" determines if the field of view narrows as the distance between the owner entity and the entity looking at it increases
    - This ensures that the width of the view cone at the owner entity position remains relatively constant, regardless of distance
  - "line_of_sight_obstruction_type" defines which block shape is considered when checking for line-of-sight obstructions
    - Supported values are "outline," "collision," and "collision_for_camera"
  - Moreover, "set_target" now supports three different values:
    - "never", looking entities are never set as targets, but events are emitted
    - "once_and_stop_scanning", the first detected looking entity is set as target, but scanning and event emission is suspended if and until the owner entity has a target
    - \[Beta\] "once_and_keep_scanning", the first detected looking entity is set as target, but scanning and event emission continues
  - All these fields are planned to be taken out of \[Beta\] and fully released at a later date
- Moved the "minecraft:redstone_conductivity" component out of the Upcoming Creator Features experiment for format_versions 1.21.30 and above 
- The "minecraft:damage_sensor" component's "deals_damage" field now supports three values: 
  - "yes", received damage is applied to the entity
  - "no", received damage is not applied to the entity
  - "no_but_side_effects_apply", received damage is not applied to the entity, but the side effects of the attack are
    - This means that the attacker's weapon loses durability, enchantment side effects are applied, etc.
  - Pre-existing content will be automatically updated to maintain its original behavior
- Removed support for the "allow_invulnerable" field from the "minecraft:looked_at component" 
  - This field never had any functionality, so this change won't affect pre-existing or future content in any way
  - The field will be ignored for any content with a format version lower than 1.21.40
  - A content error will be emitted for any content with a format version equal to or higher than 1.21.40 that still uses this field

## Entities

- Horse armor now correctly renders on horses when using resource packs with a minimum engine version of 1.17.0 or lower ([MCPE-185316](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185316))

## Entity Components

- "behavior.fire_at_target" is no longer usable if it is missing a projectile definition and will now throw a content error if so

## Entity Event Responses

- Added the "execute_event_on_home_block" entity event response, which allows the entity to execute an event on the block at its home position
  - The "event" field allows to specify the event to execute
  - For this to work properly, the entity must have a "minecraft:home" component with a set home position
- Added the "reset_target" entity event response, which allows an entity to reset its target 
- The "behavior.jump_around_target" can no longer be used by an Entity on top of a Honey Block ([MCPE-176991](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-176991)) 
- Jump Boost now increases how high an Entity can jump when using "behavior.jump_around_target" ([MCPE-176922](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-176922))
- Wind Charges now use the `minecraft:explode` component instead of `minecraft:wind_burst`
- Expanded `minecraft:explode` with the following new fields:
  - `damage_scaling`: A scale factor applied to the explosion's damage to entities. A value of 0 prevents the explosion from dealing any damage. Negative values cause the explosion to heal entities instead
  - `toggles_blocks`: If true, the explosion will toggle blocks in the explosion radius
  - `knockback_scaling`: A scale factor applied to the knockback force caused by the explosion
  - `particle_effect`: The name of the particle effect to use. The accepted strings are `wind_burst` or `breeze_wind_burst`. All other inputs will use the default explosion particles
  - `sound_effect`: The name of the sound effect played when the explosion triggers
  - `negates_fall_damage`: Defines whether the explosion should apply fall damage negation to Players above the point of collision
  - `allow_underwater`: If true, the explosion will affect blocks and entities underwater

## Feature

- Using unsupported feature placement in "pregeneration_pass" will now throw a content error instead of crash

## General

- Made the following changes to 'minecraft:single_block_feature'
  - 'places_block' now supports a list of weighted block specifiers
  - New 'randomize_rotation' property
  - New 'may_not_attach_to' placement conditions
  - Added 'diagonal' as a new option for 'may_attach_to' conditions
  - File format version increased to 1.21.40

## Graphical

- Fixed bug where the tessellation of Redstone dust does not match the powered state of the dust for the following blocks: 
  - minecraft:\*\_slab
  - minecraft:chain
  - minecraft:chorus_flower
  - minecraft:chorus_plant
  - minecraft:farmland
  - minecraft:grass_path
  - minecraft:heavy_core
  - minecraft:jigsaw
  - minecraft:sea_lantern
  - minecraft:sniffer_egg
  - minecraft:structure_block
- Add new the_end.client_biome.json as the first new type of file to contain per-biome rendering and audio settings in resource packs 
- Starting with base game version 1.21.40, built-in biomes_client.json files will no longer be loaded. That file from other packs will continue to be loaded. Water and fog settings are now in individual client_biome.json files in resource packs. When both biomes_client.json and the individual client_biome.json file specify competing values, the loaded biomes_client.json from creator content will have priority

## Blocks

- Fixed a bug where old block IDs were incorrectly overwriting data of new block IDs from blocks.json format_version 1.21.20 or higher ([MCPE-186255](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-186255)) 
- Updated references to old block names in behavior pack color recipe files 
- Updated references to old block names in behavior pack feature files
- Updated references to old block names in biome definition files

## Items

- The `"minecraft:item"` object is parsed with a strict loader from 1.21.40
  - Numbers and booleans are no longer interchangeable in the JSON input
  - Floating point numbers are no longer accepted where an integer is expected

## Molang

- Molang queries "wing_flap_position" and "wing_flap_speed" now work for the Chicken 

## Resource and Behavior Packs

- Built-in packs now include archive files for improved load performance on some platforms 

## Stability and Performance

- Increased the size of biome ids in saved chunk data from 8 bit to 16 bit values 
- Fixed a bug where extremely fast moving entities would cause the game to crash. Entities can now no longer move more than 16 blocks in a single tick. (For reference, an entity with Speed 255 will move ~11 blocks in a single tick.)
- Game will no longer crash when loading a world near an End City
- Worlds created with Experimental Custom Biomes before Caves & Cliffs update will have their Custom Biomes in Chunks replaced with a default Biome (Ocean for Overworld)
- Custom biome ids are now assigned with values starting at 30,000 and are stored in 'BiomeIdsTable' in world data so their id assignments persist for the duration of the world 
- Made a change on Nintendo Switch which may help neighboring chunks to load quicker when player has maximum framerate set ([MCPE-120971](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-120971))

## Resource and Behavior Packs

- Fixed an issue where packs were not downloaded or applied when joining a server that had CDN enabled
- Fixed an issue where user choice for downloading/applying resource packs during server join was ignored when CDN is enabled on the server

## Trading

- Fixed an issue where trades with negative 'max_use' values could not be traded

# Experimental Technical Updates

## Add-Ons and Script Engine

- Add support for custom items with the "minecraft:block_placer" item component to use the referenced "block" as the icon for the item
  - If the "minecraft:icon" component is specified, it will override the "block" icon
  - Requires the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle. Must use item json version `1.21.40` or higher
- Added "replace_block_item" field to the "minecraft:block_placer" item component. This field allows you to specify that this item should replace the default item created for the data-driven block it places. To use this field, the identifier of the item must match the identifier of the block it places. This field is optional and defaults to false. 

## API

- Added enum `PlatformType`  
  export enum PlatformType {  
  Console = 'Console',  
  Desktop = 'Desktop',  
  Mobile = 'Mobile',  
  }  
  Class `ScriptClientSystemInfo`
  - Added field `platformType`
  - Added field `maxRenderDistance`

## Cameras

- Fixed an issue where `rider_rotation_lock` of `minecraft:rideable` had no effect when using the `minecraft:follow_orbit` camera
- Added `minecraft:camera_attach_to_player` to `minecraft:follow_orbit` 
- Added `align_target_and_camera_forward` option to the camera preset behavior pack JSON which can be used when the third person camera preset experiment is enabled 
- 3rd person camera experiment - The radius property of the creator cameras is now constrained to a value between 0.1 and 100
- Third person boom camera will now reset to the starting rotation values specified in json when the 'default' parameter is passed in the camera command
- Added camera relative movement to the "New Third Person Presets" experimental toggle 
  - Camera relative movement is enabled on any camera that inherits from `minecraft:follow_orbit` and sets `align_camera_and_target_forward` to `false`
- Added horizontal and vertical rotation limits to the Focus Target Camera experimental toggle 
- Added "continue_targeting" bool to the Focus Target Camera experimental toggle for tracking entities outside of set rotation limits 

## Molang

- Adding under upcoming creator features:
  - `query.client_memory_tier`. Returns a number representing the client RAM memory tier, 0 = 'Undetermined', 1 = 'SuperLow', 2 = 'Low', 3 = 'Mid', 4 = 'High', or 5 = 'SuperHigh'. Available on the Client (Resource Packs) only
  - `query.server_memory_tier`. Returns a number representing the server RAM memory tier, 0 = 'Undetermined', 1 = 'SuperLow', 2 = 'Low', 3 = 'Mid', 4 = 'High', or 5 = 'SuperHigh'. Available on the server side (Behavior Packs) only

## Scripting

- Added enum `MemoryTier`

``` hljs
    export enum MemoryTier {
        Undetermined = 0,
        SuperLow = 1,
        Low = 2,
        Mid = 3,
        High = 4,
        SuperHigh = 5
    }
```
