-   Added helper functionÂ *isValid()*Â to several classes in order to check if the object is valid. This can safely be used on any handle to a native object before accessing or using the object, to ensure the underlying object still exists and is valid to use
    -   Block (checks the block is a valid position in bounds and the containing chunk is loaded & ticking)
    -   Container (checks the relevent container inventory exists and is valid)
    -   Effect (checks the owning entity is valid and the effect exists on that entity)
    -   ScreenDisplay (checks the owning player is valid)
    -   ScoreboardObjective (checks the objective entry exists and is attached to a valid scoreboard)
    -   Entity (checks that the entity exists in the world. Will return true if the entity is dead)
        -   Player
        -   SimulatedPlayer (Note simulated players do not automatically get removed from the world, soÂ *isValid*Â will return true long after they are dead)
    -   ContainerSlot (checks the item context is valid: Container exists in the world, such as the owning entity, and the slot is within the container bounds)
        -   Already existed as a read-only property, changed to a method for consistency
-   Component
    -   EntityAttributeComponent (checks the owning entity is valid and the attribute exists on the entity)

**Camera**

-   Changed camera command fade color to take integer values from 0 to 255 rather than 0.0 to 1.0 fractional values
-   Camera fade command now enforces fade duration limits; fade in, hold, and fade out must be between 0 and 10 seconds
-   Ensuring camera pitch can only be between -90 and 90 degrees when using the /camera command
-   Camera preset JSON now supports an optional bool \'*player_effects*\' value which causes game rendering to use player effect state (for example night vision) when this preset is active. Added the \"*example:example_player_effects*\" preset to demonstrate this
-   Camera command can now take a \'facing\' option instead of a \'rot\' option with a target entity or position specified
-   Fixed custom cameras to not use the \'inside block\' effect when player head is inside a block ([MCPE-170206](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-170206))
