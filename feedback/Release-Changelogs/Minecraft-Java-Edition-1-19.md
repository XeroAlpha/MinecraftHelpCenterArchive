  - Unlike Soul Sand, no slowdown effect will be applied
- Mud can be created by using a water bottle on dirt, by hand or with a Dispenser
- Packed Mud can be crafted from Mud

## MUD BRICKS

- Mud Bricks are a building block that can be crafted from Packed Mud

- Tadpoles can be caught in a bucket

## DEEP DARK BIOME

Dig into the depths far underground to uncover the darkest biome in Minecraft - the Deep Dark.

- Dimly lit and eerie, the Deep Dark is sure to strike fear into the hearts of even the most brave player
- Less flooded than surrounding areas
- The floor of the Deep Dark is covered in sculk
- No mobs spawn in the Deep Dark

## ANCIENT CITY

Wander the halls of these long-abandoned structures in the Deep Dark depths to uncover some relics long forgotten.

- Ancient City structures spawn in Deep Dark biomes
- In chests, guarded by Sculk Sensors and Sculk Shriekers, you can find the new Swift Sneaking enchantment
- You can also find a new mysterious block called Reinforced Deepslate here, which cannot be obtained in Survival
- Mobs cannot spawn in Ancient Cities

## DARKNESS

- A new mob effect applied to nearby players by the Warden and Sculk Shrieker
- Lowers the gamma to an equivalent of “Moody” while having this effect
- In periodic pulses, will lower the overall brightness of the world so that the darkness creeps up towards light sources
- The icon for the Darkness effect is only shown in the inventory
- A new Accessibility slider has been added in your Options menu called “Darkness Effect”

- These Disc Fragments can be found rarely in Ancient City Chests

## RECOVERY COMPASS

A new Recovery Compass can be crafted with Echo Shards, another new item which can only be found in Ancient City Chests

- Unlike a normal Compass, the Recovery Compass will point to the last place you died
- If you are not in the dimension you last died, or you haven’t died yet in your world, it will spin randomly
- It can be crafted with 1 Compass surrounded by 8 Echo Shards, which can be found in Ancient Cities

## SWIFT SNEAK

Imbue your leggings with this shiny new enchantment to move as fast while crouching as you would normally walk!

- When applied, it will increase your movement speed while sneaking
- Has 3 different levels with different speed increases
- It is the first enchantment unique to leggings equipment!

## SCULK

The rattling tendrils of the Sculk Sensors had to come from somewhere, right? Introducing sculk, a new family of blocks that dwells in the Deep Dark.

- Added Sculk Catalyst Block, a mysteriously soul-emitting block that blooms with Sculk patches underneath nearby dying mobs
  - Mobs that perish in the presence of the Sculk Catalyst will not drop their experience
- Added Sculk Blocks
  - When a mob dies near a Sculk Catalyst, some unknown process seems to consume blocks beneath and turn them into Sculk Blocks
  - A Sculk charge that spreads has a chance to consume some of its charge to grow a Sculk Sensor or Sculk Shrieker
  - Sculk Blocks have very low blast resistance
- Added Sculk Vein Blocks
  - These veins are found on the edge of Sculk patches
  - Similar to Glow Lichen, they can be placed in any orientation
  - Spreading of veins causes other blocks to be taken over by the sculk
  - Sculk Vein can spread underwater
- Added Sculk Shrieker Block
  - Sculk Shriekers can be found growing rarely from the charge of a Sculk Catalyst
  - Sculk Shrieker can be waterlogged
  - Notable for its boney appendages, this block responds to Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations by sending out a warning call to distant Wardens
    - Watch out when stepping on them, as they will feel that too and send out a call!
  - Initially it may take some time for a Warden to arrive, but you’ll hear it responding in the distance…
  - Once it’s close enough, a call from the Sculk Shrieker will summon the Warden nearby - be prepared!
- Souls from mobs will spread through Sculk Veins and Sculk Blocks in random directions until they find a valid substrate they can feed off of
  - The charge from souls in the Sculk Blocks and Sculk Veins will eventually decay, but it will decay slower within close vicinity of the Sculk Catalyst and faster when further away from its host
  - If the charge is dropped outside the range of the Catalyst, it has a chance of growing a Sculk Sensor
- Sculk, Sculk Veins, and Sculk Catalysts require Silk Touch to acquire
  - If mined without Silk Touch, they will drop experience instead
- The efficient tool for all Sculk family blocks is the Hoe

## WARDEN

The horror of the Deep Dark! A creature with no eyes, roughly resembling the Sculk that can be found throughout the Deep Dark, the Warden is an unstoppable force of nature that inhabits this biome. Wardens are powerful creatures, and it is often better to sneak around one that has emerged instead of taking it head on - you have been warned.

- Just like Sculk Sensors, these terrifying creatures use vibrations as a means to navigate their environment
- When vibrations aren’t enough, they will also use a sense of smell to track down their prey - you can observe them sniffing their surroundings to get closer to unsuspecting players and mobs
- If something gets too close, it will be noticed
- In the Deep Dark, Wardens can appear anywhere
  - When enough Sculk Shriekers have been alerted to your presence, a Warden will appear
- The more vibrations a Warden detects, the more angry it will get
  - You can hear and see this from how fast the souls in its chest are beating
- Once a mob has pushed beyond the Warden’s anger threshold, it will face its prey and roar before charging
- Building up high, hiding behind walls or being out of range of their powerful melee attack will cause Wardens to switch to their ranged attack
  - Their rib cages will open up to shriek a sonically charged ranged attack that can penetrate walls
  - This attack bypasses protection for armor and shield
- If, however, you keep the Warden from noticing you or getting angry for 60 seconds, it will dig back underground and despawn
  - If the Warden is stuck in a liquid, it will despawn instead of digging
- They have a special interaction with thrown projectiles
  - If the Warden receives two projectile vibrations within 5 seconds of one another, it will grow angrier at the shooter
  - If the Warden receives a projectile vibration more than 5 seconds from the last projectile, it will not grow angrier at the shooter
  - This allows you to strategically distract the Warden without it getting angry while you take loot from nearby chests
- Wardens will also disable shields when they hit them with their fists
- They drop a Sculk Catalyst upon death

## CHANGES TO VIBRATIONS

- Carpets, like Wool Blocks, will now dampen the vibrations caused by their placing, breaking, or dropping as items
- Carpets now also dampen the vibrations caused by running and jumping over them
- item_interact_start and item_interact_finish vibrations are ignored if sneaking

## ALLAY

- Allays will collect all the surrounding items that match the item they are holding
- Allays will like a player who hands them an item and will bring the items they collect to their liked player
- If the Allay hears a Note Block play, that Note Block becomes the Allay’s favorite Note Block for 30 seconds
  - The Allay will stay near that Note Block for that duration and bring its collected items to Note Block instead of to the player
- Interacting with an Allay with an empty hand will remove the item the Allay is holding
- Allays can be found at Pillager Outposts and in Woodland Mansions
- Allays are immune to damage from their liked player
- Allays have a natural health regen of 2 health per second

## BOAT WITH CHEST

- Lets you bring more stuff on your boat adventures
- If you are in the Boat, press the open inventory key to access the Chest contents
- If you are not in the Boat, sneak and use your interact key to access the Chest contents
- If you break the Boat the Chest contents will spill out, like with other Chests
- Also works with Hoppers, Droppers, and other blocks that interact with Chests
- Like other Chests, opening a Boat with Chest or breaking the Boat will anger Piglins, since they think all Chests belong to them

## GOAT HORNS

- A Goat Horn drops when a Goat rams a tree or any other hard block that occurs naturally where Goats spawn (Log, Stone, Packed Ice, Iron Ore, Copper Ore, or Emerald Ore)
  - Other solid blocks are unfamiliar to the goat, so it won’t ram them
- Use the Goat Horn to play a loud sound that can be heard from afar
- Each Goat Horn has its own sound based on the Goat it originated from
- There are 8 Goat Horn variants, 4 of them exclusive to Screaming Goats
- Goat Horns can sometimes be found in Pillager Outposts

## ADVANCEMENTS

- Added “It Spreads” for killing a mob near a Sculk Catalyst
- Added “You’ve Got a Friend in Me” for having an Allay deliver items to you
- Added “Birthday Song” for having an Allay drop a Cake at a Note Block
- Added “With our Powers Combined” for having all Froglights in your inventory
- Added “Bukkit Bukkit” for catching a Tadpole in a Bucket
- Added “From Dirt to Mud” for using a Water Bottle on Dirt
- Added “When the Squad Hops into Town” for getting each Frog variant on a Lead
- Added “Sneak 100” for sneaking near a Sculk Sensor or Warden to prevent it detecting you
- Added Darkness effect to the “How Did We Get Here?” advancement

## PREDICTABILITY OF RANDOMIZED EVENTS

Some randomized events are now more predictable and no longer have a possibility of extreme behaviors:

- Placement and velocity of things dropped from Droppers/Dispensers
- Placement and velocity of items spawned from containers upon destroy
- Randomized follow_range component attribute for mobs
- Velocity of Horses spawned from Skeleton Traps
- Blaze random position and randomized speed of Blaze projectiles
- Randomized portion of damage and velocity of Arrows
- Randomized flight pattern of Fireworks
- Bobbing patterns and time until a Fish appears for Fishing Rods

## FOUR NEW MUSIC TRACKS

- The new music tracks are called Ancestry, Aerie, Firebugs, and Labyrinthine
- They play in certain biomes

## MINECART VARIANTS

- The recipes for minecart with Chest/Furnace/TNT/Hopper are now shapeless
- When broken each Minecart variant drops itself as item, instead of splitting into two items (such as Chest and Minecart)

## MONSTER SPAWNING

- Endermen, Skeletons, Wither Skeletons and Piglins now spawn in a wider range of light levels in the Nether (from light level 0 to 11)
  - This makes it possible for more types of mobs to spawn inside Nether Portals, which causes them to instantly change dimensions after spawning
  - Our intent for the future is to prevent most mobs from spawning in Nether Portals and the ones that do will not immediately travel through the portal - expect to see these changes in a coming version

# TECHNICAL

#### `AVOID_VIBRATION`

 

- Triggered when a vibration event is ignored because the source player is holding the sneak key
- Conditions:
  - `player` - a player for which this trigger runs

 

#### `KILL_MOB_NEAR_SCULK_CATALYST`

 

- Triggered when a player kills an entity next to a Sculk Catalyst

## BLENDING

 

- Blending now supports 3D biome blending, which blends the underground biomes as well as the overground biomes
- Removed `blending_data.old_noise`, now existence of `blending_data` in chunk data determines if a chunk is considered old
- Added `blending_data.min_section` and `blending_data.max_section` that determines which section data that will be used for blending

 

## CHAT PREVIEW

 

- Servers can enable Chat Preview by setting `previews-chat=true` in `server.properties`
- Custom servers can enable or disable chat preview for certain clients by sending a new network packet
- When enabled, a server-controlled preview appears above the chat edit box, showing how the message will look when sent
  - A preview is also shown for chat-related commands, such as `/say` and `/msg`
- This can be used by servers to preview messages with styling applied, such as emojis or chat coloring
- Chat Preview sends chat messages to the server as they are typed, even before they’re sent
  - The server then sends back the styled preview in real time
  - This allows servers to apply dynamic message stylings while still allowing chat to be securely signed
- A warning screen is shown on the client when joining a server with Chat Preview, and it can be globally disabled in Chat Settings

 

## CHAT TYPES

 

- Different chat style formats can now be controlled by the server through the `chat_type` registry
  - These are synchronized to clients when they join the server
  - The translation key or translation format can be defined, like `chat.type.text` or `%s says: "%s"`
    - Chat can be similarly optionally narrated with a custom translation key or format
  - The entire message can have formatting applied, such as italics or a specific color (but currently not click or hover events)

 

## COMMANDS

 

### `PLACE`

 

New command that replaces `placefeature` and can place features, jigsaws, structures, and templates at a given location. Syntax:

 

``` has-line-data
place feature <feature> [pos]
place jigsaw <pool> <start> <depth> [pos]
place structure <structure> [pos]
place template <template> [pos] [rotation] [mirror] [integrity] [seed]
```

 

Parameters:

 

- `place feature` works like `placefeature` used to work
- `place jigsaw` works like using the generate button in the UI of a Jigsaw Block
- `place template` works like using the load button in the UI of a Structure Block
- `place structure` generates a full structure, matching how structures generate during world generation
- `feature`: The namespaced id of a configured feature to try to place
- `structure`: The namespaced id of a structure to try to generate
- `template`: The namespaced id of a template (“structure block file”) to load and place
- `pool`: The namespaced id of a template pool to start generating
- `start`: The namespaced id name of a jigsaw to use as the starting anchor
- `depth`: The maximum number of jigsaw connections to traverse during placement
- `pos`: The position to use as the origin for the generation (if omitted, `~ ~ ~` is used)
- `rotation`: The rotation to apply (if omitted, `none` is used)
- `mirror`: The mirroring to apply (if omitted, `none` is used)
- `integrity`: The structure integrity value between 0 and 1
- `seed`: The seed to use for the randomized degradation when integrity is less than 1

 

## DEBUG

 

- Added a heap memory allocation metric to the F3 debug screen
- Added estimated GPU utilization percentage to performance profiling metrics and the F3 debug screen
  - This is only available for graphics devices that support GPU timer queries
- Removed the debug hotkey that cycles the render distance

 

## GAME EVENTS

 

### ADDED EVENTS

 

- `teleport` with a vibration frequency of 5
- `note_block_play` with a vibration frequency of 6
- `instrument_play` with a vibration frequency of 15

 

### COMBINED EVENTS

 

The following events have been collapsed into `block_activate` and `block_deactivate`:

 

- `block_press`
- `block_unpress`
- `block_switch`
- `block_unswitch`

 

### OTHER CHANGES

 

Other miscellaneous changes to game events:

 

- `ring_bell` has been removed and replaced with `block_change`
- Both `shulker_open` and `shulker_close` have been removed in favour of using `container_open` and `container_close`
- `fishing_rod_cast` and `fishing_rod_reel_in` have been renamed to `item_interact_start` and `item_interact_finish`
- `item_interact_start` is not detectable as a vibration to allow more specific actions be detected, like `drink` or `eat`, but `item_interact_finish` is
- `entity_interact` should be dispatched more often when interacting with various mobs
- Added the `dampens_vibrations` block tag that that includes all Wool and Wool Carpet blocks, to indicate blocks that will not trigger when placed, broken, or stepped on
- Renamed item tag `occludes_vibration_signals` to `dampens_vibrations` item tag as well

 

### RENAMED EVENTS

Sets the item tags needed for instrument items to a randomly selected instrument from a tag  
Parameters:

 

- `options` - a tag reference specifying the instrument options to randomly pick from

 

## MULTIPLAYER SECURE CHAT SIGNING

 

- Chat messages between players are now cryptographically signed
  - The message arguments to `/say`, `/msg`, `/teammsg`, and `/me` commands are all also signed
- Players are given a Mojang provided key-pair on startup
- Servers can require players to have a Mojang-signed public key by setting `enforce-secure-profile=true` in `server.properties`
  - Enforcing secure profiles will prevent players without a Mojang-signed public key from connecting
  - By default this is set to `false`, allowing players to connect without a Mojang-signed public key
- Static chat styling can now be controlled by the server through the `chat_type` registry, or with server resource packs as before
- Dynamic chat styling can also be controlled by the server, although this is only signed when Chat Preview is enabled
  - Clients can prefer to always show the original, signed message by enabling “Only Show Secure Chat” in Chat Settings
- Chat from players still using Mojang Accounts is not signed
  - Their messages will not show for players with “Only Show Secure Chat” enabled
  - They may be unable to join server with the `enforce-secure-profile` option enabled

 

## PACK FILTERS

 

- Data and resource packs can have `filter` section in `pack.mcmeta`
- This section has mandatory field `block`, which is a list of patterns (regular expressions) for namespaces and paths
- If any of the files in packs are added before one with `filter`, the section will match any pattern inside `block`, and it will then be filtered out (i.e. treated as if it wasn’t present in the first place)
- `filter` section does not apply to a pack containing it - only to packs loaded before it
- Both `namespace` and `path` can be omitted
  - Missing field matches every value
- For example, adding a pack with this section in `pack.mcmeta` after the vanilla pack will hide all the recipes and advancements defined by the vanilla pack

 

### EXAMPLE

 

``` has-line-data
"filter": {
    "block": [
        {
            "namespace": "minecraft",
            "path": "recipes/.*"
        },
        {
            "namespace": "minecraft",
            "path": "advancements/.*"
        }
    ]
}
```

 

## PAINTINGS

 

- Paintings that are placeable in survival can now be controlled with the `painting_variant/placeable` tag
- Added unused paintings from Bedrock edition (`earth`, `wind`, `fire`, `water`)
  - These paintings are not placeable by default, but can be added through a datapack

 

## POINT OF INTEREST TYPES

 

- Removed `unemployed` and `nitwit` `point_of_interest_type`s
- Added tag `point_of_interest_type/acquirable_job_site` for all job sites seeked by villagers with `none` profession
- Added tag `point_of_interest_type/village` for PoI that are part of village
- Added tag `point_of_interest_type/bee_home` for all PoI targeted by bees

 

## PREDICATES

 

- The `feature` field in location predicates is now called `structure`

 

### ENTITY PREDICATE

 

- `player`, `fishing_hook`, `lightning_bolt` and `catType` fields have been replaced with `type_specific`
- `type_specific` has field `type` (one of `player`, `fishing_hook`, `lightning_bolt` or `cat`) and same fields as removed fields
- `catType` has been wrapped to match new format and now uses new cat variant names instead of texture names:
- New `type_specific` options:
  - `frog` has `variant` field matching Frog variant (`minecraft:warm`, `minecraft:temperate` or `minecraft:cold`)
  - `slime` applies for Slimes and Magma Cubes, has `size` field matching Slime size (smallest is `1`)

 

#### `CATTYPE` EXAMPLE

 

Before:

 

``` has-line-data
 "catType": "minecraft:textures/entity/cat/british_shorthair.png"
```

 

After:

 

``` has-line-data
 "type_specific": {
    "type": "cat",
    "variant": "minecraft:british"
 }
```

 

#### `TYPE_SPECIFIC` EXAMPLE

 

Before:

 

``` has-line-data
 "lightning_bolt": {
   "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
 }
```

 

After:

 

``` has-line-data
  "type_specific": {
    "type": "lightning",
    "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
  }
```

 

## SPACE GLYPH PROVIDER

 

- The new glyph provider type `space` is added to allow creation of space-like glyphs
- The new provider has a single argument called `advances` which is a map of codepoint to glyph advance (width)
- The rendering of space glyph is no longer hardcoded (needs to be declared manually in font)

 

## WORLD PRESETS

 

- New registry types `worldgen/world_preset` and `worldgen/flat_level_generator_preset` have been added to configure data-driven presets (like “Amplified” or “Single Biome”)
- Two tags for world presets have been added (`normal` and `alternative`) to control which values show on the “World Type” button in the “Create World” screen
- One tag has been added (`visible`) for flat world presets to control the order that elements are displayed in the “Configure Flat World” screen
- World presets can also be used as a value of `level-type` in `server.properties`
