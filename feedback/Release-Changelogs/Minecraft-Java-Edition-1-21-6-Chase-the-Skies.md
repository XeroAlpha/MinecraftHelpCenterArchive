![1.21.6_1170x500.jpg](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/37432097124877)

Experience the joy of soaring above the Overworld with our Chase the Skies drop! This drop not only brings an exciting flying mount to Minecraft but opens up the skies for exploring, building – and more. Raise your ghastling with care and it'll let you soar with friends above the clouds once fully grown.  
  
With 1.21.6 we are also taking steps towards adding Vibrant Visuals to Java. In this release, there are new fog improvements and clouds will extend all the way to the horizon.  
  
Go out and explore the Overworld, build high into the sky, leash a caravan of camels together, uncover new music, and find wandering friends with the Player Locator bar.

### Happy Ghast

The Happy Ghast is a new mountable flying mob.

#### Dried Ghast Block

- The Dried Ghast block is found in Nether Fossil structures and is the first stage of the Happy Ghast mob
- Can be crafted with 1 Soul Sand block and 8 Ghast Tears
- When waterlogged, it undergoes 3 hydration level changes over approximately 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob
- The hydration level decreases when it is no longer waterlogged, using the same timescale
- The hydration level is not preserved when mined
- Makes sounds and shows particles depending on its hydration level
- The Dried Ghast block emits a vibration frequency of 11 when its block state changes

#### Ghastling Mob

- The Ghastling is a young version of the Happy Ghast mob
- Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes
- After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow:
  - Players within a 16-block radius or
  - An adult, non-aquatic passive mob or some of the neutral mobs within a 16-block radius
- If no player or suitable mob is close around, the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position where it spawned or was last interacted with
  - It will reset its home position if it is moved more than 16 blocks away from the border of its home position
- Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs
- Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes, or faster if fed Snowballs

#### Happy Ghast Mob

- Can be equipped with a Harness and then be mounted by up to four players
- Tempted by Snowballs and Harness
  - The Happy Ghast can only be tempted with a Harness when it has no harness equipped
- Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds
- The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting above it in the front seat
  - When controlled, the goggles of the Happy Ghast flip down to cover its eyes
- Players mounting after the first player are placed in slots on each side of it, starting clockwise from the first player
- Pressing the sneak key dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast
- If the Happy Ghast detects players standing on top of it, it ceases all movement and rotates to the closest cardinal direction
  - This happens regardless of whether it has a Harness equipped or not
- When mounted on the Happy Ghast, the third-person camera is further away from the player
- When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, it starts its roaming behavior
  - If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it starts roaming
  - The roaming behavior is similar to the Ghastling, except for the radius being 64 blocks
  - When wearing a Harness, the Happy Ghast roams closer to the home position, within a 32 block radius
  - When leashed, the Happy Ghast has a roaming distance of 10 blocks
  - The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming
- Cannot be bred
- Cannot enter boats
- Has no panic behavior when taking damage

#### Harness Item

- The Harness is a new item that can be equipped on a Happy Ghast to allow players to ride it
- The Harness comes in 16 different colors
- Can be crafted out of 3 Leather, 2 Glass blocks and 1 Wool block
  - The Harness will have the same color as the Wool block used when crafting
- Can be re-dyed in the crafting grid
- Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast
- Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast
- Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears when no players are mounted

###  

### Locator Bar

The Locator Bar is a new UI element that displays the direction of other players in the world.

- If another player is in the world (and that player is not hiding) the Locator Bar will display in the same area as experience bar
  - When experience is gained the experience bar will appear
  - If there are no other players in the world the experience bar will display as normal
- Facing other players within a 120 degree range will display those players as colored indicators on the Locator Bar
  - Other players that are above/below the screen will also display an up/down arrow together with their indicator
  - The indicator will change to different sized icons depending on how far away the other Player is
  - Colored indicators are randomized for each player
    - Operators can modify the colors of indicators with the /waypoint command
      - e.g.: /waypoint modify @s color red to set an indicator to red
    - Players on a team will override their default indicator color with their team color
- Players can hide by crouching, wearing a mob head or a Carved Pumpkin, or using a Potion of Invisibility
- Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar
  - However, spectators are visible to each other
- The Locator Bar can be toggled off by setting the locatorBar game rule to false

### Music and Sound

  - "Tears" by Amos Roddy

### Projectile Targeting

- The target tolerance margin of projectiles now changes over time
  - Previously, all projectiles had a target tolerance margin of 0.3 blocks
  - Now, all projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight
  - After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the previous 0.3 blocks margin
  - This allows for better precision close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway when the projectile is further away

### Splash Potions

- Splash Potions distance to affected entities now depends on the closest distance between the entity hitbox and the splash potion hitbox where it landed
  - This means that if an entity is hit directly by the splash potion, it will receive the full effect of the potion

### Commands

#### Added version

Prints the current version information on the server side.

- Takes no arguments
- Available in singleplayer or for server operators

#### Added datapack create

Creates a new empty directory data pack for the current world.

- The supported pack version is always equal to one supported by the game
- Available only to server owners
- Syntax: datapack create \<id\> \<name\>
  - id - new pack name, must be a valid directory name
  - name - text component to be placed in description in pack.mcmeta

#### Modified playsound

- Added new category ui
  - Sounds in this category will continue playing when paused, similarly to music

#### Added waypoint

This is a new command for querying and modifying waypoints.

    waypoint list

    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color <color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color hex <hex-color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color reset
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> style <waypoint_style/resource>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> style reset

Arguments:

- entity-selector: For selecting entities that are transmitting as waypoints (see waypoint_transmit_range attribute)
- color: Overrides the Locator Bar icon color for this waypoint
- hex \<hex-color\> arguments are in web format (RRGGBB)
  - Red is either hex F00 or hex FF0000
  - Cornflower blue is hex 6495ED
- style: For changing the icon spriteset and selection distances
  - set \<waypoint_style/resource\> changes the style to a specific asset under waypoint_style/ (see Waypoint Styles section below)
  - reset will restore the default icon behavior of the Locator Bar

### Waypoint Broadcasting

The Locator Bar works through a server-controlled Waypoint system. Waypoints are received by Players, and connections between Waypoints and Players are managed by the multiplayer server.

- By default, all Players transmit a Waypoint from themselves, and all Players receive all Waypoints
- Individual Players can have their transmission and receive ranges controlled by the waypoint_transmit_range and waypoint_receive_range attributes

### Dialogs

- Added a way to display simple modal dialogs to a user
- Dialogs are stored in a minecraft:dialog registry, but can also be defined inline
- Dialogs are an experimental feature
- To avoid user confusion, dialog screens are marked with a warning sign next to the title
  - Clicking on this warning leads to a screen that explains to user that this screen is provided by custom content
  - It also gives the user an option to leave the current world to avoid them being locked in an infinite loop of dialogs
  - If a new dialog is received by the client while warning screen is visible, it will not replace it, but when user clicks the "Back" button, the new dialog will be restored instead
- Dialogs can be displayed by server in play and configuration connection phases
  - However, only inline registries are allowed in configuration, since registries are not yet available in that phase
  - Additionally, run_command click event is not available in configuration phase
- Dialogs by default will close after the Escape key is pressed
  - When this happens, dialog will run action specific to dialog type described as "exit action" below
  - This behavior is configurable
- When the dialog screen is closed, the game goes back to previously displayed non-dialog screen or back to gameplay
  - That means that new dialogs always replace already opened ones, if any
- Dialogs can be configured to be accessible from Pause menu
  - This replaces and expands the "Server Links" button added in previous versions
- New key bind called "Quick Actions" has been added to allow accessing content-configured dialogs
- Most dialogs follow a common layout, however exact contents depend on type:
  - Header with title and warning button
  - Body elements, scrollable if needed:
    - messages and items
    - inputs
    - actions buttons
  - Optional footer, contains main buttons and submit actions

> **Developer's Note**: *Dialogs are not supposed to fully describe any in-game UI, but just to allow custom content to display simple messages and get input from users. This feature is intentionally limited to match that use case.*

 

#### Dialog Description Format

- Dialogs are stored in minecraft:dialog registry that can be provided by a datapack

Fields:

- type - one of dialog types from minecraft:dialog_type registry
- \<type-specific\> - see below

### Common Dialog Fields

- Most dialog types share some fields. To avoid duplication, they are listed in this section

Fields:

- title - screen title, text component
  - Should be always visible on screen, no matter the specific type
- external_title - name to be used for a button leading to this dialog (for example from Pause screen), optional text component
  - If not present, title will be used instead
- body - optional list of body elements or a single element, see below
- inputs - optional list of inputs, see below
- can_close_with_escape - can dialog be dismissed with Escape key, default true
- pause - should the dialog screen pause the game in single-player mode, default: true
- after_action - additional operation performed on dialog after click or submit actions, default: close
  - close - closes dialog and returns to previous non-dialog screen (if any)
  - none - do nothing, i.e., keep the current screen open
    - only available if pause is false to avoid locking the game in single-player mode
  - wait_for_response - replace the current dialog with a "Waiting for Response" screen
    - this option is intended to prevent users from sending multiple actions on laggy connections
      - servers are expected to eventually replace this screen with a new dialog
    - to avoid accidental locking, a "Back" button will become active after 5 seconds
      - clicking this button will continue as if the dialog was closed (i.e., game returns to the previous non-dialog screen, if any)
    - "Waiting for Response" screen will unpause the game in single-player mode to avoid locking the game

### Static Dialog Action Types

All existing click_event actions (except for open_file) are included as dialog action types.

Uses same format as click_event on text components (but with action replaced with type) For example, when using show_dialog, the entry for action button will look like this:

    {
        "label": "some label",
        "action": {
            "type": "show_dialog",
            "dialog": "some:id"
        }
    }

### minecraft:dynamic/run_command Action Type

- This action will build a run_command event using a provided macro template
- The macro will be expanded with string values from inputs
  - For example, if the macro template is some_command \$(some_input), the string value from input with key of some_input parameter will be used for the template expansion
  - Inputs not used in macro will be ignored, while macro parameters not matching any inputs will be replaced with an empty string

Fields:

- template - a string with a macro template to be interpreted as a command

#### minecraft:dynamic/custom Action Type

- Additional static fields can be added to payload

Fields:

- additions - fields to be added to payload, optional compound tag
- id - namespaced ID

### Built-in Dialogs

The built-in datapack contains some custom dialogs to provide customization of specific screens used by the client.

#### minecraft:server_links

- Replacement for the previously existing "Server Links" screen
- Meant to simplify migration for servers that previously used this feature

#### minecraft:custom_options

- Shows contents of minecraft:pause_screen_additions tag (see below)
- Allows the user to select a specific dialog if this tag contains multiple entries
- Note: Since this tag is meant for interoperability, any content that replaces this dialog should be careful not to hide other dialog providers

#### Dialog Command

- New command has been added to show dialog to clients

Syntax:

- dialog show \<targets\> \<dialog\> - show dialog to player(s)
  - \<targets\> - player name, UUID or a player selector
  - \<dialog\> - a namespaced ID from minecraft:dialog registry or inline dialog value as described above
  - Returns the number of players in targets argument
- dialog clear \<targets\> - clean dialog for player(s), if they have any visible
  - \<targets\> - player name, UUID or a player selector
  - Returns the number of players in targets argument

#### Pause Screen Configuration

- A data pack can request some of the available dialogs to be accessible from Pause screen
- This feature replaces the "Server Links" button and is placed on Pause screen according to the same rules
- Buttons leading to dialogs exposed in this way will use label described in external_title field
- This feature is configured by minecraft:pause_screen_additions dialog tag:
  - If this tag is not specified or is empty but the server has sent server_links packet, the tag will be handled as if it contained minecraft:server_links dialog
    - Note: this matches previous Server Links feature behavior
    - If this dialog is removed, the tag remains empty
  - If this tag is still empty, the button will not be visible ("Send Feedback" and "Report Bugs" buttons are visible instead)
  - If this tag has a single element, the pause screen button will lead directly to that dialog
  - If this tag has multiple elements, the pause screen button will lead to a minecraft:custom_options dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
    - If this dialog is removed, the button is will not be visible

#### Quick Actions Key Bind

- A new key bind has been added that allows users to access a set of dialogs
- Default key: G
- This feature is configured by minecraft:quick_actions dialog tag
  - If this tag is empty, the key bind will do nothing
  - If this tag has a single element, the key bind will open that dialog
  - If this tag has multiple elements, the key bind will lead to minecraft:quick_actions dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
    - If this dialog is removed, the key bind will do nothing
- This option is intended for use in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty in the Vanilla pack

### Text Components

#### Click Events

- Users will now be prompted for confirmation before executing a command from the run_command click action in books and chat if the command can't be parsed or requires elevated permissions (i.e., higher than 0)

#### Added minecraft:custom

- A new click action called minecraft:custom has been added
  - When user clicks a component with this click action, the client will send a dedicated packet minecraft:custom_click_action to a server
  - The intended use is as an alternative for run_command to be used by modded servers without worrying about having to add custom commands
  - This packet has no functionality on Vanilla servers
  - Fields:
    - id - namespaced ID
    - payload - optional tag field

#### Added minecraft:show_dialog

- A new action called show_dialog has been added
  - When user clicks this component, a dialog will be opened for them
  - Fields:
    - dialog - a namespaced ID from minecraft:dialog registry or inline dialog value as described above

### Game Rules

#### Added locatorBar

- Default is true: enabling the Locator Bar
- Changing to false will remove all existing Waypoints from all players

### Attributes

#### Added camera_distance

- Default value: 4.0
- Modifies the distance at which the camera is placed away from the player or spectated entity when in a third-person view
- If the entity being ridden has a larger camera_distance attribute, that distance will be used
- This distance is multiplied by the scale attribute to get a final target camera distance

#### Added waypoint_transmit_range and waypoint_receive_range

- Default: 0.0, Minimum: 0.0, Maximum: 60000000.0

- Players have a default transmission and reception range of 60,000,000

- Mobs with a transmission range above zero will send waypoint packets to nearby receivers that are within that range

- Similarly, receivers only receive waypoints that are inside their reception range (and receive nothing if that range is zero) Examples:

- /attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 0 will prevent a player from transmitting (hiding them)

- /attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 80 will only let a player transmit up to 80 blocks (hiding them from players further than that)

- /attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 0 will prevent a player from receiving (turns off their Locator Bar)

- /attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 120 will only let a player see Locator Bar dots that are within 120 blocks (hiding all players further than that)

#### Changed flying_speed

- The flying_speed attribute now also applies to Ghasts and Happy Ghasts

### Data Components

#### equippable Item Component

- Added a new optional field: can_be_sheared (boolean)
  - If true, players can use Shears to remove this equippable item from a target mob by right-clicking, provided all other shearing conditions are satisfied
  - If not specified, it defaults to false
- Added a new optional field: shearing_sound (sound event)
  - It's a sound event that plays when the equippable item is sheared
  - If not specified, it defaults to the item.shears.snip sound event

#### attribute_modifiers Item Component

- Added an optional display field to attribute_modifiers entries
  - There are 3 display types:
    - default - Current behavior of showing the calculated attribute modifier values on the tooltip
    - hidden - Does not show the attribute modifier entry
    - override - Replaces the shown attribute modifier text
      - Contains a single field value for the text contents to show for this attribute modifier entry

#### painting/variant Item Component

- No longer accepts inline variants

### Entity Data

- Added the home_pos and home_radius fields to all mobs
  - Mobs with set home position will limit their pathfinding to stay within the indicated area
  - Some mobs, such as Bats, Slimes, Magma Cubes, Phantoms and Ender Dragons may ignore it
  - Interacting with leashes or riding may change the home position of the mob

#### area_effect_cloud

- The Particle field has been renamed to custom_particle, and now always functions as an exact override for the default colored entity_effect particle
  - The field will not be written if no override is specified

  - far_distance distance must be greater than near_distance
- sprites is a list of at least one sprite IDs within the prefix of hud/locator_bar_dot/ (the directory textures/gui/sprites/hud/locator_bar_dot)
- An example "bowtie" waypoint style is provided and accessible via the command:

- When the distance to the waypoint is less than near_distance, the first sprite in the list will be selected
- When the distance to the waypoint is greater than far_distance, the last sprite in the list will be selected
- Between this range, sprites will be selected based on the linear progress between the near and far distances

  - Those glyphs are loaded as a separate sub-font minecraft:include/unifont_pua and are not included in any normally used font
  - Characters in those areas are managed by Under-CSUR (Under-ConScript Unicode Registry), which adds various scripts not present in official Unicode set, like Tengwar or Sitelen Pona

#### unihex Font Provider

- The size_overrides field is now optional (defaults to empty list)

### Equipment Assets

- Added new happy_ghast_body layer type, rendering in the body slot of the Happy Ghast

### Item Models

- Item model definitions now have a boolean field oversized_in_gui which is false by default
  - If true, the item model will be allowed to be bigger than its item slot
  - If false, the item model will be clipped to the item slot size when being rendered in gui
  - This ability of items being rendered outside their slots should not be considered officially supported, it was temporarily restored as an exception since many servers are relying on it
  - At some point in the future we hope to replace it with an officially supported way of achieving similar functionality
- Introduced new item model minecraft:player_head to handle player profile texture loading and rendering
- Removed support for minecraft:profile from minecraft:head

#### minecraft:player_head Special Model Type

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: *Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future.*

- All built-in uniforms are now uniform blocks instead of opaque loose uniforms
- Custom uniforms provided to post-process shaders are now uniform blocks
- Uniform definitions inside json files are now per-block

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

- Entries in the targets map have been expanded to support new properties
  - New optional boolean field: persistent (default: false)
    - If true, this render target will be persistent across frames
    - The contents of the target will be cleared when the screen is resized
  - New optional field: clear_color (default: \[0, 0, 0, 0\])
    - Format: integer ARGB value, or float array in order \[R, G, B, A\]
    - When this target is created or cleared, it will be filled with this color
- The uniforms values is now a list-per-block, instead of a global list
  - e.g. uniforms: { "UniformBlockName": \[ { "type": "vec2", "value": \[...\] } \] }
    - The order of uniforms in a block **must** match the order in the shader
- name as part of a uniform definition is no longer used
  - We encourage setting it to help keep the json file organized/readable, but the game won't use it
- value as part of a uniform definition replaces the old values, and the type depends on the type field
  - This field is required
  - "type": "int" needs "value": 123 (a single int)
  - "type": "float" needs "value": 123.4 (a single float)
  - "type": "vec2" needs "value": \[1.2, 3.4\] (two floats)
  - "type": "vec3" needs "value": \[1.2, 3.4, 5.6\] (three floats)
  - "type": "ivec3" needs "value": \[1, 2, 3\] (three ints)
  - "type": "vec4" needs "value": \[1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8\] (four floats)
  - "type": "matrix4x4" needs "value": \[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0\] (four rows of four columns of floats)
- We do not validate that the uniform block is valid for a given shader, giving incorrect information will cause undefined and funky behavior

#### Post-process Effect Shaders

- Instead of every uniform being an individual opaque type, they are now grouped in uniform blocks
  - They will be set according to the pass definition in the json file, and may be shared across both vertex and fragment shaders
- The list of sizes (all vec2 \*Size uniforms) are now replaced with a single SamplerInfo uniform block
  - This contains, *in order*, the size of the output texture followed by the size of every input texture
  - The order of textures in the definition file will dictate the order of samplers in this uniform
  - For most post chains this is just OutSize and InSize as before
  - All sizes are vec2

#### post/bits.fsh

- Expects a BitsConfig of float Resolution and float MosaicSize

#### post/blit.fsh

- Expects a BlitConfig of vec4 ColorModulate

#### post/blur.vsh and post/box_blur.fsh

- Expects a BlurConfig of vec2 BlurDir and float Radius

#### post/color_convolve.fsh

- Expects a ColorConfig of vec3 RedMatrix, vec3 GreenMatrix and vec3 BlueMatrix

#### post/invert.fsh

- Expects a InvertConfig of float InverseAmount

#### post/rotscale.vsh

- Expects a RotScaleConfig of vec2 InScale, vec2 InOffset and float InRotation

#### post/spiderclip.fsh

- Expects a SpiderConfig of vec4 Scissor and vec4 Vignette

#### Shader Fog Changes

- The fog is now split into environmental and render-distance-based fog
- Previously both those concepts were mixed in the same uniforms
- Environmental fog is supposed to represent the "fogginess" of the environment the player is in
  - e.g. lava, water, and now also atmosphere
- Render distance fog is supposed to obscure the border of visible terrain
- Environmental fog uses spherical distance to determine its intensity, render distance fog uses cylindrical distance
- The resulting fog value for any given vertex is the maximum of both

#### Globals Uniform Block

- Available through \#moj_import \<minecraft:globals.glsl\> for convenience
- Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
- Contains ScreenSize, GlintAlpha, GameTime and MenuBlurRadius (new)
  - MenuBlurRadius is the blur radius of the background when a menu is open

#### Fog Uniform Block

- Available through \#moj_import \<minecraft:fog.glsl\> for convenience
- Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
- Contains FogColor, FogEnvironmentalStart (new), FogEnvironmentalEnd (new), FogRenderDistanceStart (renamed from FogStart), FogRenderDistanceEnd (renamed from FogEnd), FogSkyEnd (new) and FogCloudsEnd (new)
  - FogSkyEnd is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing for the sky
  - FogCloudsEnd is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing the clouds
  - FogRenderDistanceStart is the render distance fog start
  - FogRenderDistanceEnd is the render distance fog end
  - FogEnvironmentalStart is new and represents the start of environment-based fog
  - FogEnvironmentalEnd is new and represents the end of environment-based fog
  - FogShape was removed. Render distance fog is now cylindrical and environmental fog is spherical

#### Projection Uniform Block

- Available through \#moj_import \<minecraft:projection.glsl\> for convenience
- Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
- Contains ProjMat with no changes

#### DynamicTransforms Uniform Block

- Available through \#moj_import \<minecraft:dynamictransforms.glsl\> for convenience
- Is no longer available to shaders that do not normally use it
- Contains ModelViewMat, ColorModulator, ModelOffset, TextureMat, LineWidth
  - These are very likely to change in the near future
  - The values of some of these are often hard coded and may not make sense for a given shader, i.e., LineWidth in any non-line based pipeline

#### Lighting Uniform Block

- Available through \#moj_import \<minecraft:light.glsl\> for convenience
- Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
  - The values may not make sense if the shader wouldn't normally expect it, however
- Contains Light0_Direction and Light1_Direction

#### CloudInfo Uniform Block

- Only available to the cloud shaders (rendertype_clouds.vsh/rendertype_clouds.fsh)
  - Contains CloudColor, CloudOffset and CellSize (new)
    - CellSize contains the size of an individual cloud cell

#### LightmapInfo Uniform Block

- Only available to the lightmap shader (lightmap.fsh)
- Contains AmbientLightFactor, SkyFactor, BlockFactor, UseBrightLightmap, NightVisionFactor, DarknessScale,   
  DarkenWorldFactor, BrightnessFactor, SkyLightColor with no change in behavior
