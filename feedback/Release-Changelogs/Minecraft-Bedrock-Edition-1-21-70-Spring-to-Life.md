## Experimental Features

### Trade Rebalancing Experiment

## Features and Bug Fixes

### Achievements with Add-Ons

- Enabled earning Achievements while playing in a world with Add-Ons applied.

### Blocks

- Placing a block in liquid, and then placing another block next to your first block in liquid will no longer replace your second placed block for a moment, causing you to fall into the liquid

- Structure Blocks no longer briefly change textures when placed ([MCPE-185531](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185531))

- Sea Pickles can now be placed on any block with center support ([MCPE-116152](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-116152))

- Barrier blocks will no longer prevent chunks rendering behind them ([MCPE-153515](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-153515))

- Fixed a crash that would sometimes happen when entities with an excessively large hitbox entered liquid

- Fixed blocks using the minecraft:destructible_by_mining component with item_specific_speeds defined flickering during their block breaking animation ([MCPE-188401](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188401))

- Fixed trigger rate of Redstone powered Droppers and Dispensers ([MCPE-189895](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-189895))

- Warped and Crimson Fungi no longer z-fight ([MCPE-190389](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190389))

### Gameplay

- Fixed a mismatch between server and client when continuously building that caused orientation sensitive blocks to sometimes change to the wrong block

- Using Riptide while standing in shallow water will once again launch the player as if they weren't standing in water. ([MCPE-188795](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188795))

- Players fall momentum is no longer reset after exiting and re-entering the world ([MCPE-188490](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188490))

- Fixed an issue where destroying and picking up a Shulker box would make it appear invisible in the inventory until world reload

- Fixed a bug where using items with a use duration (fishing rods, food, potions, etc...) and changing slots would force your slot back to the original slot

- Fixed an issue where attacking a mob while sprint jumping would remove all player momentum ([MCPE-189501](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-189501))

- Fixed an issue where laggy players fighting would occasionally not be able to hit each other ([MCPE-190552](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190552))

- Fixed an issue where Player's collision box would sometimes be incorrect after using a bed ([MCPE-190604](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190604))

- Bundles no longer become empty after being held by an Armor Stand ([MCPE-190093](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190093))

### General

- Fixed a crash that would occur on Xbox if you pressed "Cancel" in the Xbox UI when converting a world or importing a world from Retail to Preview

- In Server Authoritative movement, when Players receive a movement correction it will use the current Player speed instead of a generic one, this should give a better experience.

- In Server Authoritative movement, when Players receive a downward movement correction it will now use gravity acceleration, this should give a better experience.

- In Server Authoritative movement, the Player will not constantly bop up and down if flying state change during small loss of connection with the server.

- Removing experimental files cold_taiga, cold_taiga_hills, and cold_taiga_mutated from behavior packs. These files were only loaded with the custom biomes experiment enabled, and this change does not remove the biomes themselves.

- In Server Authoritative movement, when Player is corrected, the movement will not have easing anymore. This is a better feel, as can be seen with upward, repeating, Pistons

- Fixed typos in music definitions and sound definitions that were causing the wrong music to play for soulsand valley, desert mutated, and jungle mutated biomes.

- Fixed an issue where chunks weren't saving properly on older worlds

- Enabled *Filter Profanity* toggle on mobile platforms.

- Hand position should remain the same while the game is paused ([MCPE-190290](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190290))

### Mobs

- Foxes now take damage from lava, and not only fire ([MCPE-56926](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-56926))
- In the 1.21.80.21 Preview changelog we mentioned that mobs related to [MCPE-188731](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188731) will be unaffected in this release. We have made every effort to make sure of this, but there's a possibility that these mobs may become invisible after the update. If this happens we believe the change will be reversible and the mobs will just be invisible and not lost completely - please keep us updated at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/).

### Realms

- In Realms Stories, changed online indicator (green dot in corner of player image) to represent general online status rather than whether the user is playing in that specific Realm. In Members tab, added "Playing on Realm" status for users currently playing in that specific Realm. Added "Online members" filter that shows users playing on Realm.

- Fixed Random Tick Speed and Respawn Radius settings resetting to default values ([REALMS-11759](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/REALMS-11759))

- Fixed "Reset Random Tick Speed" button not working when editing an existing world on Realms

- Fixed ability to remove Realm members that are not friends of the Realm owner

- Fixed ability to rejoin Realm with Hardcore world via invite link

### Pause Feature

We are thrilled to include a highly requested feature: the ability to pause the game in single player. The feature will be rolled slowly to ensure stability. After two weeks, it will be available to everyone.

- **Pause when alone:** you can pause when you are alone in a local world owned by yourself.
- **Un-pause when joined:** your game will un-pause if someone joins you.
- **Join notification:** a notification will inform you that someone else has joined and that your game has resumed. The notification includes the option to takes you right back to the game, perfect if you are deep in a menu.
  - *Note: The game will NOT pause if you are playing on a Realm, server or when playing with a friend on your local server.*

### Sounds

- Fixed Block breaking sounds not playing ([MCPE-190264](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190264))

### User Interface

- Bundle tooltip no longer flickers for players beyond the first when playing in split screen

- Adjusted Minecoin purchase screen UI to not show stray pixels. Fixed overlapping issue on PS4.

- Replacing items with the lock_in_inventory component with items from the creative inventory using touch input now fails gracefully and produces a warning message.

- Minecraft logo misaligned on progress screen.

- Touch controls: Fixed a bug where a player could stay moving diagonally after opening a menu ([MCPE-190308](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190308))

- Keep Inventory is back to being a cheat on all difficulties. ([BDS-19921](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-19921))

- The "Place" controller tooltip is no longer incorrectly hidden when being able to place additional Pink Petals, Wildflowers, or Leaf Litter. ([MCPE-190225](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190225))

- Changes have been made to the Multiplayer tab in create new world and edit world! Player permission icons have been updated to better signal the roles, and on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles now shows a message informing the player that they need to sign in to access multiplayer features. Below the message there's a button that will take the player to respective console sign in flow.

- Beacon rendering is no longer limited by the player's vertical distance from it ([MCPE-25228](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-25228))

#### Biomes

- Fixed an issue where Dark Forests were missing trees along their northern borders with other biomes

- Updated the tree composition in Dark Forests to match Java Edition, increasing the number of Dark Oak Trees and reducing the prevalence of other tree types

#### Mobs

### Biomes

#### Client Biome Components

- Add minecraft:dry_foliage_color component to override color for dry_foliage tint method

#### @minecraft/server 1.18.0

- Renamed system.scriptEvent to system.sendScriptEvent

- Moved NamespaceNameErrorReason from beta to @minecraft/server 1.18.0

- Moved system.sendScriptEvent from beta to @minecraft/server 1.18.0

- Moved NamespaceNameError from beta to @minecraft/server 1.18.0

- Released InputInfo.getButtonState, InputButton, and ButtonState to @minecraft/server 1.18.0

- Released InputInfo.getMovementVector to @minecraft/server 1.18.0

- Released PlayerButtonInputAfterEvent, AfterEvents.playerButtonInput and InputEventOptions to @minecraft/server 1.18.0

### Blocks

- water and lava no longer will turn into flowing_water or flowing_lava when neighbor updates happen. water and lava now will respond to queued ticks without needing to change into another block

- "minecraft:material_instances" component has a new experimental boolean field "isotropic" for format version **1.21.70** and higher, this field controls rotating the face UVs randomly based on BlockPos

- Empty Bell blocks no longer crash the game when moved by a sticky piston JIRA: ([MCPE-188687](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188687))

- Updated the /fill, /clear and /testforblock Commands

  - Fixed a bug where these commands would recognize IDs of some flattened blocks as block group names and affect all variants under those groups

- Add dry_foliage tint method which uses the textures/colormap/dry_foliage.png color map

### Commands

- Fixed commands not executing when command is entered with leading spaces ([MCPE-147815](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-147815))

- Moved the place feature and place featurerule subcommands out of the Upcoming Creator Features experiment

- Removed set_movement_authority command.

### Components

- Added the 'minecraft:replaceable' component which determines if a new block can replace the existing block at a particular position. If the component is not added to a block it is not replaceable.

- Multiple components that used effect durations can now be set to "infinite" including:

  - "minecraft:attack": "effect_duration"
  - "minecraft:healable": "duration" in the "effects" list
  - "minecraft:mob_effect": "effect_time"
  - "minecraft:projectile": "durationeasy", "durationnormal", and "durationhard" can now all use "infinite"
  - "minecraft:food": "duration" in the "effects" list
  - "minecraft:spell_effects": "duration" in the "add_effects" list
  - "minecraft:combat_regeneration": "regeneration_duration"

- Added the "minecraft:is_collidable" component

  - This component allows other mobs to have vertical and horizontal collisions with the component's owner
    - For a collision to occur, both mobs must have a "minecraft:collision_box" component
    - This component can only be used on mobs and enables collisions exclusively between mobs
  - Please note that this type of collision is unreliable for moving mobs
    - It is recommended to use this component only in scenarios where the mob remains stationary
  - Collidable behavior is closely related to stackable behavior
    - While the "minecraft:is_collidable" component governs how other mobs interact with the component's owner, the "minecraft:is_stackable" component describes how an entity interacts with others of its own kind

- The "entity_sensor" component now has two additional fields:

  - "y_offset", applies a vertical offset to the entity's position when calculating distances to other entities
  - "find_players_only", restricts the search to Players only, affecting all subsensors

- Added the "minecraft:body_rotation_axis_aligned" component, that causes the entity's body to automatically rotate to align with the nearest cardinal direction based on its current facing direction

  - Combining this with the "minecraft:body_rotation_blocked" component will cause the entity to align to the nearest cardinal direction and remain fixed in that orientation, regardless of future changes in its facing direction

- Added validation for asset references in components

  - Content errors will log missing references for the following fields:
    - item references
    - block reference in item component in "minecraft:block_placer"
    - loot table reference in block component "minecraft:loot"

- The "entity_sensor" component's "find_players_only" field now functions correctly, properly restricting searches to Players only and affecting all subsensors

- Added the "minecraft:input_air_controlled" component, that enables controlling flying rideables

  - Functions similarly to "minecraft:input_ground_controlled", but instead of limiting acceleration to the XZ-plane, this component applies acceleration in the direction the player is looking in three dimensions
  - Supports adjustments to strafing and backward movement speeds, allowing entities to fly at equal speeds in all directions or move slower when strafing or reversing
  - This component is experimental and as such requires "use_beta_features" to be enabled
  - It may undergo significant changes or even be replaced as development progresses

### Creator

- ItemTag support in the match_tool loot table condition no longer requires enabling the "Upcoming Creator Features" experiment toggle

### Data-driven Jigsaw Structures

- Fixed placement of Jigsaw structures that contain blocks with minecraft:tick component.

### Dedicated Server

- Exposed two new parameters for dedicated server when in server-auth-with-rewind. These will make the server more strict on player positions. Look in server.properties for more information on what these do.

  - server-authoritative-movement-strict default to false and can be set to true. Will affect Player position acceptance
  - server-authoritative-dismount-strict default to false and can be set to true. Will affect Player position when dismounting

- Exposed a new parameter for dedicated server. This will make the server more strict on entity interactions. Look in server.properties for more information on what these do.

  - server-authoritative-entity-interactions-strict default to false and can be set to true. Will affect Entity interaction acceptance

- Removed server-authoritative-movement parameter. It will now always use server-auth-with-rewind.

### Editor

We are excited to announce Editor v0.9! To learn more about Editor and its multiblock world editing capabilities, check out the documents [HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/bedrockeditor/?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable), or learn how to build an Editor Extension [HERE](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor)

## Feature Highlights in Editor v0.9

### Realms Integration

You can now publish your Editor Project directly to Realms, making it simple to play or test your world on any device. Need to tweak something? You can also download your Realms world back into the Editor for further edits. Just make sure you’re signed in with an active Realms subscription.

### Grid Repeat

Grid Repeat is a new mode within the Repeater Tool which allows you to effortlessly repeat a selection in the x, y, and z directions, making tasks like adding windows to a building or creating an entire city a breeze. The Grid Repeat feature includes both Uniform and Separate repeat types, allowing you to customize the number of instances repeated in all directions.

### Updated Structure Management

We have updated the Structure feature to provide better management of your structures. You can now rename, delete, and duplicate structures with ease. Additionally, you can rename the file/unique name and change the namespace for more precise organization. Please note that project structures will be exported to the editor/structuredb subdirectory in the world folder.

### Multiblock Workbench

We have updated the Workbench Tool to work with multiple blocks of the same type. Simply select the blocks you want to manipulate and then go to the Workbench Tool.

### Block and Entity Inspector

Block and Entity Inspector allow you to view block states and entities and then customize specific properties. This is incredibly useful to fine tune details.

- Added particle_item_name map to particle_on_hit on hit sub-component, maps an item name to an actor filter to determine what the name of the item used in the particle should be. Falls back to the name of the entity itself as before.

### Entity Event Responses

- Added the "stop_movement" entity event response, which stops the entity's movement

  - The "stop_vertical_movement" field specifies whether vertical movement should be stopped
  - The "stop_horizontal_movement" field specifies whether horizontal movement should be stopped
  - This response does not stop navigation or prevent future movement
    - If that's the desired outcome, also remove the components responsible for that

- Added the "set_home_position" entity event response, which sets the entity's home position to its current position

  - For this to have any effect, the entity must already have a "minecraft:home" component

### Entity Events

- Server Authoritative movement is now turned on by default.

### Goals

- "minecraft:behavior.float_wander" AI goal will now restrict mobs to their home position if they have the "minecraft:home" component

- Added "use_home_position_restriction" field to "minecraft:behavior.float_wander" AI goal to control whether mobs respect home position restrictions when selecting target positions

  - Defaults to false for entities with format version below 1.21.70, and true for 1.21.70 and later
  - When true, the mob will respect home position restrictions when selecting target positions

### Jigsaw

- Fixed world_surface type of heightmap_projection in minecraft:jigsaw to generate on top of water and leaf blocks.

- Fixed gaps from appearing between data-driven jigsaw structure pieces.

### JSON Events

- The parameter "duration" in the "add_mob_effect" event can now be set to "infinite"

### Mobs

- Added maximum value of 100000000.0 and minimum value of -100000000.0 to **"minecraft:collision_box"** component

- Added aquatic family-type for all aquatic mobs

- Normal Minecart is no longer considered a mob

### Network Protocol

- Added ActorFlags::COLLIDABLE
- Added ActorFlags::BODY_ROTATION_AXIS_ALIGNED
- Added ActorFlags::WASD_AIR_CONTROLLED

### Particles

- Multiple controllers transitioning out of a state at the same time will now properly expire all intended particles instead of just the last one

### Sounds

- Added support for entity sound variants

  - Entity sounds now have a "variants" field which defines sound variants based on the runtime entity
  - Variants has a "key" field reading a Molang expression returning a string to select sound variant (eg: querying an enum entity property).
  - Variants has a "map" field which contains key-value pairs of a variant identifier and the sound events it overrides.
  - When playing a sound for an entity we first try to calculate their variant and see if that variant overrides the sound event, if not we play the sound form the base entity. If that fails we fall back to the existing logic of running from "defaults". Example: Given a mob with the following property

<!-- -->

    "minecraft:emotional_state": {
      "type": "enum",
      "values": [ "neutral", "angry", "happy", "sad" ],
      "default": "neutral",
      "client_sync": true
    }

Sound variants can be played by querying the property:

    {
      "entity_sounds": {
        "entities": {
          "test_mob": {
            "volume": 1.0,
            "pitch": 1.0,
            // The base sounds for various events
            "events": {
              "ambient": "mob.test_mob.ambient",
              "death": "mob.test_mob.death",
              "step": {
                "sound": "mob.test_mob.step",
                "volume": 0.8,
                "pitch": 1.0
              },
              "attack": "mob.test_mob.attack"
            },
            "variants": {
                // Key returning the enum string for variants, can use any Molang expression resulting in a string
                "key": "query.property('minecraft:emotional_state')",
                "map": {
                  // If a resulting variant key is not handled here then it will use the base sounds
                  "neutral": {
                    "volume": 1.0,
                    "pitch": 1.0,
                    "events": {
                      // If an event is not handled in a variant then it will use the base sound
                      "death": "mob.test_mob.death.netural"
                    }
                  },
                  "angry": {
                    "volume": 1.0,
                    "pitch": 1.0,
                    "events": {
                      // Variants can override different events than other variants
                      "death": "mob.test_mob.death.angry",
                      "ambient": "mob.test_mob.ambient.angry"
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

- Sound effects found in animations and animation controllers can now include an optional "locator" field similar to particle effects allowing them to originate from the locator on the entity rather than the origin

### Structures

- Fixed mirroring and rotation of crafter blocks when part of a structure that is being placed:

## Experimental Technical Updates

### API

- Added new script module @minecraft/diagnostics version 1.0.0-beta. This module is dedicated server only for now and allows script modules to connect their script packs to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). This enables remote error tracking and monitoring for script packs.

  - removePropertyOverrideForEntity: Removes the override of the specified Entity Property on the target Entity.
  - clearPropertyOverridesForEntity: Removes all overrides of any Entity Properties on the target Entity.

### API - Molang

- Added query.graphics_mode_is_any to Molang which accepts any of the following parameters: simple, fancy, deferred, raytraced. These parameters are all graphics modes that are available in the settings menu.

### Blocks

- The minecraft:map_color component underwent a schema change

  - It is now a JSON object with two fields "color" and "tint_method".

  - "color" is a required string field expecting an HEX representation of the RGB, prefixed with a \# character.

  - "tint_method" is a string field that multiplies the color with a predefined tint. Supported values are "none, "default_foliage", "birch_foliage", "evergreen_foliage", "dry_foliage", "grass" and "water".

  - the old schema format is still supported for convenience. Examples:

        "minecraft:map_color": {
          "color": "#ABCDEF",
          "tint_method": "grass"
        }

    or

        "minecraft:map_color": {
          "color": "#ABCDEF"
        }

    or

        "minecraft:map_color": "#ABCDEF"

- - The minecraft:material_instances component supports an optional "tint_method" field in its instance definitions

    - "tint_method" is a string field that multiplies a face color with a tint computed with the biome the block is in. Supported values are "none, "default_foliage", "birch_foliage", "evergreen_foliage", "dry_foliage", "grass", and "water".
    - Held block-items are tinted as if they were in the "plains" biome. Example:

  <!-- -->

            "*": {
                "texture": "minimal",
                "render_method": "opaque",
           "tint_method": "water"
            }

- Exposed the Block component minecraft:destruction_particles as a JSON object. This represents the particles used when the Block is destroyed

  - There is two fields for it:

  - "texture" is a required string field to set the texture used by the particles

  - "tint_method" is an optional string field that multiplies the texture color with a predefined tint. Default to "none". Supported values are "none", "default_foliage", "birch_foliage", "evergreen_foliage", "dry_foliage", "grass" and "water".

  - Block format before 1.21.70 will be upgraded to have the component added using the texture from the "down" or "\*" of the minecraft:material_instances component if present and "none" for tint_method. This was the old behavior.

  - Block format from 1.21.70 without the component will not be upgraded and uses the invalid texture  
    Examples:

         "minecraft:destruction_particles": {
          "texture": "my_particles_texture",
          "tint_method": "grass"
         }

    or

        "minecraft:destruction_particles": {
         "texture": "my_particles_texture"
        }

### Experimental

- Removed the Experimental Third Person Cameras toggle and added an Experimental Creator Camera Features toggle for all future experimental cameras

### General

- Removed unused experimental json field peaks_factor from minecraft:mountain_parameters in the behavior pack biome file
