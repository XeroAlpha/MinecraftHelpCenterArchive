**Posted:** September 25, 2020

Another hotfix is rolling out on PlayStation 4 to improve stability issues that were introduced in the 1.16.42 update. We're continuing to make further stability improvements so please continue to engage with us through [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/) and keep the bug reports coming.

**Fixes:**

-   Fixed additional crashes when signing into a Microsoft account ([MCPE-100881](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-100881))
-   Fixed an issue where launching PS VR with Supersampling enabled caused crashes in VR Mode
