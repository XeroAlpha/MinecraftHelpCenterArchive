It's a fantastic day today, because it's release day Thursday! And not just any old release day. This one is extra special because today we're shipping Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21, also known as the Tricky Trials Update!

Venture into the hazardous Trial Chambers alone or with friends, face off against the new Breeze mob and craft a smashingly powerful new weapon, the Mace! Take your ingenious Redstone designs to new heights with the Crafter, play around with the Wind Charge, discover new decorative blocks made of Copper and Tuff, enjoy new Paintings, Music Discs, and more!

And that's not all! On the technical side, Tricky Trials is heralding a new age for data packs with Enchantments, Paintings and Jukebox Music Discs now being data-driven. With this release, we're also going live with performance improvements to chunk loading that were introduced in 24w19a, which reduces memory and CPU overhead compared to the old system.

Embark on your very first adventure in Tricky Trials by delving into the full changelog below, it's a long one!

Happy mining!

### STRUCTURES

#### TRIAL CHAMBERS

- Trial Chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges
  - Made out of a variety of Copper and Tuff blocks, and can be found in different sizes
  - A relatively common find throughout the Deepslate layer of the underground
  - Natural mob spawning does not occur inside, similar to Ancient Cities
  - Never starts inside a Deep Dark biome, but can sometimes overlap it
- The layout of each Trial Chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, rewards and a variety of combat areas
  - Decorated Pots line the corridors and hold hidden treasures
  - Supply Barrels can be found between different rooms, and give you blocks and items which help you navigate your trials
  - Vaults are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of many high level Enchanted Books and equipment including a very rare chance to receive a Trident
  - Ominous Vaults can be found in harder to reach places and give even better loot than standard Vaults, including some items which are exclusive to Ominous Vaults
- Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
  - Melee
    - Zombie
    - Husk
    - Spider
  - Small Melee
    - Slime
    - Cave Spider
    - Baby Zombie
    - Silverfish
  - Ranged
    - Skeleton
    - Stray
    - Bogged
- Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber
  - For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Spiders, Silverfish and Skeletons
  - The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes

### MOBS

#### BREEZE

- A cunning hostile mob spawned by some Trial Spawners in Trial Chamber rooms
  - Drops 1-2 Breeze Rods when killed by a player
  - The number of Breeze Rods dropped is affected by looting enchantments
- Moves primarily by leaping around its target
- Deflects almost all projectiles, making it immune to ranged combat
  - With one notable exception: it cannot deflect Wind Charges
- An aggressive adversary, it shoots volatile wind energy in the form of Wind Charge projectiles at its target
  - After colliding with an entity or a block, Wind Charge projectiles produce a Wind Burst, which knocks back entities in the area
  - Wind Charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity
  - Wind Charges break decorated pots and chorus flower blocks upon collision
- Wind Bursts have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
  - Non-Iron Doors and Trapdoors are flipped
  - Fence Gates are flipped
  - Buttons are pressed
  - Levers are flipped
  - Bells are rung and swung
  - Lit Candles are extinguished
- Wind Bursts do not have any effect on Iron Doors, Iron Trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a Redstone signal
- Will not retaliate against attacks from the following mobs: Skeletons, Strays, Bogged, Zombies, Husks, Spiders, Cave Spiders and Slimes
  - The same mobs will not retaliate against a Breeze when hurt by its Wind Charge projectile

#### BOGGED

- A new variant of Skeletons that shoots poisonous arrows
  - They're easier to take down with 16 health instead of 20 health
  - They attack at a slower interval of 3.5 seconds instead of 2 seconds
- Has a chance to drop Arrows of Poison when killed by players
- These mossy and mushroom covered Skeletons spawn naturally in Swamps and Mangrove Swamps
  - Can also be found spawning from Trial Spawners in some Trial Chambers
- Drops 2 mushrooms when sheared (either both red, both brown, or one of each)

### WEAPONS

#### MACE

- A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
  - Has a base damage of 5
  - Can be crafted with a Breeze Rod and a Heavy Core
  - Using it will decrease its durability like any other weapon; can be repaired with Breeze Rods at an Anvil
- Has a unique attack called the smash attack. When the player falls more than 1.5 blocks before hitting, a smash attack is triggered which has multiple effects:
  - Safe Fall: Resets all vertical momentum and negates any fall damage accumulated from the fall
  - Extra Damage: Does more damage the further the player fell before hitting the target with it:
    - For the first 3 blocks fallen: Add 4 damage per block
    - For the next 5 blocks fallen: Add 2 damage per block
    - For any blocks fallen after: Add 1 damage per block
  - Great Knockback: Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
- Can be used in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks to enemies
- These existing enchantments can be applied to the Mace:
  - Mending
  - Unbreaking
  - Smite
  - Bane of Arthropods
  - Fire Aspect
  - Curse of Vanishing
- The Mace also has 3 exclusive enchantments: Density, Breach and Wind Burst

### ENCHANTMENTS

Three new enchantments have been added which are exclusive to the Mace

- Density
  - Common Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in random loot chests
  - Has 5 levels
  - Maces enchanted with Density do more damage per fallen block per Density level
    - Damage dealt per fallen block is increased by 0.5 per level of Density
  - Mutually exclusive with Breach, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods
- Breach
  - Rare Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in random loot chests
  - Has 4 levels
  - Maces enchanted with Breach reduce the effectiveness of armor on the target
    - The effectiveness of the armor is reduced by 15% per Breach level
  - Mutually exclusive with Density, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods
- Wind Burst
  - Unique enchantment which can only be found in Ominous Vaults
    - Only Wind Burst I can be found, higher levels must be obtained by combining them in an Anvil
  - Has 3 levels
  - Maces enchanted with Wind Burst will emit a Wind Burst upon hitting an enemy, launching the attacker upward and enabling the linking of smash attacks one after the other
  - Successfully landing a Wind Burst attack causes the player to lose the fall damage protection they would otherwise have from landing a successful smash attack
  - Each level will bounce the attacker an additional 7 blocks into the air

### BLOCKS

#### CRAFTER

- A new block that enables the crafting of items and blocks via Redstone
  - Can be crafted with 5 Iron Ingots, 2 Redstone Dust, 1 Crafting Table and 1 Dropper
- Will eject one crafting result at a time when powered by a Redstone pulse
  - Its current powered state is indicated by Redstone crystals on its back face, which will light up
  - The crafting grid on its top face will light up red when it successfully crafts a recipe
- Upon receiving a signal, it will eject the recipe result from the front face
  - If the recipe output has any remainder items (such as a Bucket), the result and remainder items will be ejected together
- When placed, the front face of the Crafter will face towards the player

##### Crafter User Interface

- Has a 3x3 interactable crafting grid
- The crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by interacting with it while not holding an item
- A slot that is ‘toggled’ cannot hold any items
  - Other blocks such as Hoppers and Droppers also cannot place items into them
- Unlike the Crafting Table, the Crafter displays a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next Redstone pulse, but cannot be manually taken out by the player
  - The arrow pointing out from the recipe grid will light up red when the Crafter is currently powered
- The Crafter User Interface is shared between all players interacting with it, meaning that multiple players can interact with the Crafter at the same time, similar to Chests and Hoppers

##### Crafter Interaction with Other Blocks

- The signal strength of a Comparator reading a Crafter is 0-9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength
- Hoppers and Minecarts with Hoppers can be used to both insert and extract items from the Crafter
- Droppers can be used to insert items into the Crafter
- Items inserted from another block (ex: Hopper, Dropper) will fill the Crafter's slots based on these rules:
  - Prioritize the first empty slot (from left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
  - If there are no empty slots then prioritize the smallest stack of the same item (pick the first if there are multiple)
  - If there is a toggled slot it will be skipped. The item will then be moved into the container

##### Ominous Trial Spawner

- A more powerful active phase of the Trial Spawner with unique challenges and rewards

    - Making it Ominous this way will bypass the cooldown
- While active, it will:
  - Glow blue instead of orange
  - Emit soul flames instead of normal flames
  - Periodically spawn potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs
    - Based on their location, spawners in an area will select a random set of projectiles to spawn

- Becoming Ominous will despawn any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge
  - If those mobs picked up or equipped any items on the floor, those items will be dropped when they despawn
  - It will stay Ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished
- When defeated, it will eject a different set of loot to normal Trial Spawners

##### Ominous Vault

- A variant of Vaults that have a more menacing looking and emit soul flames instead of normal flames

### ENCHANTMENTS

Enchantments are now set through data. An Enchantment is a set of core properties like level ranges and cost together with some effects. Most effect types also support a set of conditions, making it possible to apply them only when certain criteria are met.

Enchantments can be added in the registry enchantment. All Vanilla Enchantments can be found in the vanilla datapack in the client and server jar files.

Fields:

- description: The name of the Enchantment when displayed in text represented as a Text Component
- exclusive_set: The Enchantment(s) this Enchantment is mutually exclusive with
  - Two Enchantments can never co-exist on an item if either is in the other's exclusive set
  - Specified as an Enchantment ID, a list of Enchantment IDs or an Enchantment Tag prefixed with \#
  - Optional - if omitted, the exclusive set is empty
- supported_items: The item types that can have this Enchantment
  - Item ID, list of item IDs or tag prefixed with \#
- primary_items: The item types for which this Enchantment shows up in Enchanting Tables and on traded equipment
  - Item ID, list of item IDs or tag prefixed with \#
  - Must be a subset of supported_items
- weight: How commonly the Enchantment appears, compared to the total combined weight of all available Enchantments
  - Positive integer, at most 1024 - higher values mean more common
- max_level: The maximum level of the Enchantment
  - All Enchantments range from level 1 to their maximum level
  - Positive integer, at most 255
- min_cost, max_cost: describe the range of costs for this Enchantment in the Enchanting Table (and how much it returns when disenchanted)
  - Both min and max cost are described using a linear formula:
  - base: Base cost at level 1
  - per_level_above_first: Added for each level over 1
- anvil_cost: The fee taken for the Enchantment in the anvil
  - Non-negative integer
  - This value is halved when an Enchantment is added to a Book
  - The effective fee is multiplied by the level of the Enchantment
- slots: A list of slot groups this Enchantment works in
  - Each entry is one of any, hand, mainhand, offhand, armor, feet, legs, chest, head and body
- effects: A map of effect components, as described below in the Effect Components section

#### LEVEL-BASED VALUES

Many effects of Enchantments depend on the level of the Enchantment. For these fields, a type called Level-Based Values is used. In their most basic form, Level-Based Values can be written as floating-point constants, which is interpreted as a value that isn't in fact level-based, the constant is used as-is for all levels.

If a Level-Based value is not a floating-point constant, it is an object with a type field, specifying one of the following types.

##### linear

The most common type of Level-Based Value is a linear value. A linear Level-Based Value has two fields:

- base: The base value added to all levels
- per_level_above_first: Amount added for each level above the first one

In effect, a linear Level-Based Value results in base + per_level_above_first \* (level - 1).

##### clamped

A Level-Based Value type that clamps a value between a min and max. Fields:

- value: A Level-Based Value used as the input
- min: A floating point value specifying the minimum value of the output
- max: A floating point value specifying the maximum value of the output

##### fraction

A Level-Based Value type that represents the fraction between two values. Fields:

- numerator: A Level-Based Value used as the numerator
- denominator: A Level-Based Value used as the denominator

##### levels_squared

A Level-Based Value type that evaluates to the square of the levels, plus an addition. Fields:

- added: A floating-point value added to the result of the squared levels

In effect, a levels_squared Level-Based Value results in level ^ 2 + added

##### lookup

A Level-Based Value type that maps a list of values to specific levels, and applies a fallback if the level is greater than the number of values supplied. Fields:

- values - A list of values indexed by level - 1 to apply, if present
- fallback - A fallback Level-Based Value to apply if the level is greater than the size of values

#### VALUE EFFECT TYPES

Value Effects are effects used to manipulate the amount of *something* in the game.

##### add

A Value Effect that adds a value to the processed results.

Fields:

- value: A Level-Based Value determining how much to add
  - Negative values are supported

##### all_of

A Value Effect that runs a number of other Value Effects, in order. This can be useful when the same set of conditions apply to a number of Value Effects.

Fields:

- effects: A list of the Value Effects to run

##### multiply

A Value Effect that multiplies the processed value by a given factor.

Fields:

- factor: A Level-Based Value determining the factor to multiply in

##### remove_binomial

A Value Effect that runs a Binomial series of checks, reducing the input value by 1 for every successful check.

Fields:

- chance: A Level-Based Value representing the chance that an input value is dropped.
  - The span is 0 to 1, with 0 being no chance to drop an input value and 1 dropping all input values

#### EFFECT CONDITIONS

Most Enchantment effects are filtered using Conditions (same types as in loot tables). This enables effects to be specific for different situations. Each Effect Component defines which parameters are available for the condition to evaluate - some parameters are available for all of these parameter sets, while some are specific to a certain set.

Unlike with loot tables, all effect conditions need to be inline objects and cannot be references.

Each effect component specifies which parameters are available in the [Effect Components](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-21#effect-components) list below.

##### Damage Parameters

- Entities: this, attacker, direct_attacker

#### EFFECT COMPONENTS

The effects field in an Enchantment is a map of Effect Component type the Effect List data. Most Effect Components are lists, so any number of Effects can be added of any Component Type. The data for each effect generally involves having a specified condition context and Effect Type, but some Effects also deviate from this format.

In cases where the documentation specifies a Condition Context and Effect, the Component is a list. Each entry in the list has a field named effect with the effect of the type used by the list. Entries can also optionally include a field named requirements specifying the condition parameters, which are then evaluated with the documented context.

A value of 0 means none of the base attack damage is transferred (sweep damage is 1). A value of 1 means all of the base attack damage is transferred (sweep damage is attack_damage + 1)

- Default: 0
- Minimum: 0
- Maximum: 1

#### GENERIC.WATER_MOVEMENT_EFFICIENCY

The movement speed factor when submerged. The higher, the more of the underwater movement penalty is mitigated. Note that this represents only the submersion factor itself, and other factors (such as not touching the ground) also apply.

- Default: 0
- Minimum: 0
- Maximum: 1

### BLOCK PREDICATES (WORLD GENERATION STYLE)

#### UNOBSTRUCTED

New block predicate type that passes if the selected block is unobstructed (no entities are in the space of the block).

Fields:

- offset: List of 3 int offset coordinates, specifying the offset from the origin position to test
  - Optional, defaults to \[0, 0, 0\] if unspecified

### ENTITY DATA

#### PROJECTILES

- Arrow-like projectile data now contains a weapon field containing an Item Stack representing the weapon the projectile was fired from
- The ShotFromCrossbow field has been removed
- Removed power NBT tag and replaced it with acceleration_power tag with a number value that control the projectiles acceleration (and maximum speed)
  - This change affects the following projectiles; dragon_fireball, large_fireball, small_fireball, fireball, breeze_wind_charge, wind_charge, wither_skull

### ITEM COMPONENTS

- The custom_data component can now be specified as an SNBT string to preserve type information in JSON
  - This is the same as is used in the set_custom_data loot function and custom_data predicate
- The food item component has a new field:
  - using_converts_to: item with components (optional)
    - Once consumed, the food item will be replaced with the specified item
    - e.g. food={nutrition:1,saturation:0,using_converts_to:{id:"poisonous_potato",components:{"minecraft:custom_name":'"Wait what?"'}}}

### STRUCTURES

- Added dimension_padding field to structures of type minecraft:jigsaw, which ensures that a structure is not generating through the edges of a dimension by adding vertical padding to its bounding box
  - Can be written as an object with two fields:
    - bottom the vertical padding at the bottom of the dimension, non-negative integer
    - top the vertical padding at the top of the dimension, non-negative integer
    - e.g. dimension_padding: { bottom: 10, top: 5 }
  - Can be written as a single non-negative integer instead to be applied to both top and bottom fields
    - e.g. dimension_padding: 10
- Added liquid_settings field to structures of type minecraft:jigsaw. Possible values:
  - apply_waterlogging: If any waterloggable block overlaps with existing water, it will become waterlogged
  - ignore_waterlogging: If any waterloggable block overlaps with existing water, it will not become waterlogged
  - Default value is apply_waterlogging
- Added optional field override_liquid_settings to single_pool_element element type
  - Has the same possible values as the liquid_settings in jigsaw structures
  - If provided, it overrides the inherited liquid settings from the parent jigsaw structure while generating this pool element

### COMMANDS

- The item argument in the /give, /item, and /loot commands now supports removal of default components with ! prefix
  - e.g. /give @s diamond_pickaxe\[!tool\] will give a Diamond Pickaxe without the tool component
- Added @n entity selector, selecting the nearest entity
  - This functions as @e\[sort=nearest,limit=1\]
  - Additional requirements may still be provided; for example: @n\[type=pig\] will select the closest Pig

## RESOURCE PACK VERSIONS 33 THROUGH 34

- Added new textures and music assets for Music Discs
- Renamed sound events for Ominous Trial Spawner becoming active and ambient sound
- Added the block.vault.reject_rewarded_player sound event
- Changes to Shaders

### SHADERS

- The blend block in core shader definitions has been removed, as it was not used
