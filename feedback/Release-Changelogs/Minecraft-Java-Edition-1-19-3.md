## TELEMETRY

This release includes the WorldUnloaded event, a required event, as well as several opt-in events. Diagnostic tracking is a tool that helps us understand what you like about Minecraft, which allows us to make those things better.

The reason that WorldUnloaded, along with[WorldLoaded](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w38a), is a required event is that the information we’re looking at is, well, required. As a part of Xbox, we all need to follow a standard of practice, you can find a detailed description of it[here](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement). The parameters for what data we consider to be critical to our work are set by our team at Mojang Studios in alignment with Xbox.

What we want to find out is how fun you think Minecraft is. There are lots of ways to figure that out, like feedback, playtests, experience, and magic. We want to add data to that mix, which is where WorldLoaded and WorldUnloaded come in. WorldLoaded measures when you boot a session up, and WorldUnloaded measures when you shut it down. Together, they will measure how fun Minecraft is, using metrics such as playtime and the game modes that players choose to play. That’s it. All the data we collect, whether it’s required or opt-in, follows GDPR and CCPA best practices to keep your information safe.

The rest of the current telemetry events are opt-in, which means that you can choose whether or not you want to send us additional data. The only players that can’t opt-in are Microsoft child accounts, but everyone can still send in all of their feedback to[feedback.minecraft.net](http://feedback.minecraft.net/).

Just like all the thoughts and comments we get from you on our feedback site, this is something that greatly helps us improve Minecraft. We want to make a game that you want to play, so we want to know what that game needs. Even if it’s more lava.

### TRANSPARENCY

- Added Telemetry Data Collection Screen
  - This screen displays information about the type of data that is sent
  - The level of data sent can be controlled between "Minimal" and "All"
    - "Minimal" sends only the required data
    - "All" sends the required data, as well as optional data
  - The default data level is "Minimal" (only the required data)
- Every telemetry event sent from the client is now logged to disk
  - Old log files are removed after 7 days
  - These can be found under thelogs/telemetrydirectory
    - A shortcut to this directory is available via the "Open My Data" button on the Telemetry Data Collection screen

### REQUIRED EVENTS

- Added WorldUnloaded event
- Removed client Java version from the WorldLoaded event

#### WORLDLOADED & WORLDUNLOADED

Understanding how Minecraft is played allows us to focus game updates and improvements on the areas that are most relevant to players.The data that tells us this includes game mode, client or server modded status, and game version.

WorldLoaded & WorldUnloaded are two paired events that calculate how long the world session has lasted (in seconds and ticks).Data from WorldLoaded is sent when a world is launched, and data from WorldUnloaded is sent when a world is shut down (quitting to title, disconnecting from a server).

### OPTIONAL EVENTS

- Added PerformanceMetrics and WorldLoadTimes events

#### PERFORMANCEMETRICS

Knowing the overall performance profile of Minecraft helps us tune and optimize the game for a wide range of machine specifications and operating systems.

The periodic performance metrics includes data such as frame-rates, rendering performance, memory usage, operating system, and the modded status of the client and server.

Game version is included to help us compare the performance profile for new versions of Minecraft.

#### WORLDLOADTIMES

It’s important for us to understand how long it takes to join a world, and how that changes over time. For example, when we add new features or do larger technical changes, we need to see what impact that had on load times.

This event includes the total time in milliseconds for the world to load, whether this was a new world, as well as game version and platform details.

## GAME RULES

- AddedblockExplosionDropDecay,mobExplosionDropDecayandtntExplosionDropDecaygame rules
  - When set tofalse, all blocks drop loot
  - When set totrue, blocks drop loot randomly depending on how far from the explosion center
  - Defaults tofalsefor tnt, true for block and mob
- AddedsnowAccumulationHeightgame rule
  - When it is snowing, this game rule determines the maximum number of layers can be accumulated in each block
  - Defaults to1
  - Set to0makes no snow form at all
  - Set to8or above lets snow form up to the level of a full block
- AddedwaterSourceConversionandlavaSourceConversiongame rules
  - When set totrue, allows new sources of that fluid to form
  - Defaults totruefor water andfalsefor lava

## RECIPES

### CRAFTING BOOK CATEGORIES

- Crafting book categories/tabs can now be controlled by recipe definitions
- Categories available forshaped/shapelessand various special crafting recipes:
  - building
  - redstone
  - equipment
  - misc(default)
- Categories available forsmelting,blasting,smoking,campfire_cooking
  - food
  - blocks
  - misc(default)
- Some crafting books collapse multiple categories into a single tab
- The exact mappings might change in the future

## RESOURCE PACKS

- The Resource Pack version is now 12
- Removed "fixers" for resource packs with versions 3 and 4 (pre-flattening)
  - The game will no longer try to adapt packs with those versions to the current version
- Game now loads all block models and blockstate definitions in appropriate directories
  - That means that if a pack has invalid model it will prevent pack from loading, even if this model is unused

### TEXTURE LOADING CHANGES

- Context: When the game loads all textures used by block and item models need to be stitched (merged) into a single image, called the "atlas"
  - Individual textures that are stitched onto the atlas are called "sprites"
- To improve loading performance, block and item textures are now loaded before they are processed by block and item models
  - By default, textures not in thetextures/itemandtextures/blockdirectories will no longer be automatically recognized and will fail to load
- Resource packs can now have configuration files, located inatlasesdirectory, that control which images are included in the atlases

#### ATLAS CONFIGURATION FILES

- New directoryatlasesis now present for resource packs
- This directory contains JSON entries for configuring atlases:
  - blocks- textures used by block and item models
  - banner_patterns,beds,chests,shield_patterns,shulker_boxes,signs- used to render some special-case models
  - mob_effects- textures used for effect icons in the UI
  - paintings- textures used for paintings
  - particles- textures used for particles (referenced by thetexturesfield in files within theparticlesdirectory)
- If multiple packs include those files, they are merged by their order within the pack (same as tags in data packs)
- Inside these files is a JSON object with a single list calledsources
  - Every entry insourcesruns in during load, in order of definition, adding or removing new files to the texture list; to be later referenced by block models, particles, etc
- Types of sources:
  - directory- lists all files in a directory and its subdirectories, across all namespaces
    - source- directory in pack to be listed (relative totexturesdirectory)
    - prefix- string to be appended to the sprite name when loaded
  - single- adds a single file
    - resource- location of a resource within the pack (relative totexturesdirectory, implied.pngextension)
    - sprite- sprite name (optional, defaults toresource)
  - filter- removes sprites matching the given pattern
    - namespace,path- patterns (regular expressions, regex) of ids to be removed (only works for entries already in the list)
      - If omitted, any value will be matched
  - unstitch- copies rectangular regions from other images
    - resource- location of a resource within the pack (relative totexturesdirectory, implied.pngextension)
    - divisor_x,divisor_y- used for determining the units used by regions
    - regions- list of regions to copy from the source image
      - sprite- sprite name
      - x,y- coordinates of the top-left corner of the region
      - width,height- size of the region
    - Values such asxare transformed to real image coordinates via dividing by their divisor, and then multiplying by the real image size
- Example: if a pack has a file namedassets/test/textures/fancy/iridium.pngand source is{"type": "directory", "source": "fancy", "prefix": "custom/"}, the texture will be available in models astest:custom/iridium

## CUSTOM PLAYER HEAD NOTE BLOCK SOUNDS

- Player Heads can now contain anote_block_soundfield
  - When present, this determines the sound a note block makes when the head is placed on top of it
