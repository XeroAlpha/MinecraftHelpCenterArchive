Do you smell that? Ah yes, it's the magical, tell-tale scent of release day Tuesday - and what a release day it is!

Today we are shipping Minecraft: Java Edition 1.20.5, also known as the Armored Paws drop! Travel to the Savanna and Badlands biomes and say hello to the endearing Armadillos. Find and befriend eight new Wolf variants and equip your canine companions with dyable armor made from Armadillo Scutes and go adventuring together!

On the technical side, the Armored Paws drop is also introducing a change to how Java Edition spawn chunks work, the details of which we covered in [the changelog for Snapshot 24w03a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w03a) earlier this year. The tl;dr version of this change is that we're making the spawn chunk radius a configurable game rule and decreasing the default value by 98%. This should translate to a noticeable performance boost for most players!

So what are you waiting for? Stock up on food and water and start reading through the complete 1.20.5 changelog below. It's a looong one.

Happy scute brushing!

## NEW FEATURES

- Added Armadillo and Armadillo Scutes
- Added Wolf Armor
- Added Wolf variants

### ARMADILLO

- The Armadillo is a new passive mob
- Armadillos drop Armadillo Scutes periodically, and when brushed
- Armadillos spawn in Savannas and Badlands
- The Armadillo's favorite food is the Spider Eye
  - Armadillos are tempted by Spider Eyes
  - Feeding two adult Armadillos Spider Eyes makes them breed
  - Feeding a baby Armadillo a Spider Eye makes it grow up quicker
- The Armadillo rolls up when it detects a threat such as:
  - A player sprinting, riding a mount, or riding a vehicle
  - Undead mobs
  - A mob or a player it has recently been attacked by
- The Armadillo does not roll up when:
  - Fleeing, in water, in the air, or when on a Lead
- When an Armadillo is rolled up:
  - It does not walk, cannot eat, and will not be tempted by food
  - Its shell will protect it, reducing damage taken, even allowing it to fully resist weak attacks
  - It will continue to scan for threats, occasionally peeking to check the surroundings
    - If no threats are detected for 4 seconds, it will unroll
- Spiders and Cave Spiders will run away from Armadillos that are not in a rolled up state

#### ARMADILLO SCUTES

- Armadillo Scutes are dropped by Armadillos periodically or when an Armadillo is brushed
- Armadillo Scutes can be used to craft Wolf Armor
- Dispensers can be used to brush Armadillo Scutes off Armadillos

### WOLF ARMOR

- Wolf Armor can be crafted with Armadillo Scutes and can be dyed in a similar fashion to Leather Armor
- The Wolf Armor will protect the Wolf from most damage sources until the armor loses all durability and breaks
- Wolf Armor shows signs of breakage as durability goes down
- Using Armadillo Scutes on the Wolf Armor while it is equipped on the Wolf will repair it
- Using Shears on a Wolf that is wearing armor will drop the armor
- Wolf Armor can only be equipped on a tame adult Wolf
- Only the Wolf's owner can equip, repair, and shear Wolf Armor
- Dispensers cannot equip nor remove Wolf Armor

### WOLF VARIANTS

New Wolf variants have been added. The variant is determined by the biome they spawn in. Wolves spawn in packs, with a default pack size of 4.

- Pale Wolf - The Wolf we're all familiar with. This variant spawns in the Taiga biome
- Woods Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Forest biome. This will be the dominant Wolf variant that you will be able to find in the Overworld, since the Forest biome is very common
- Ashen Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Snowy Taiga biome
- Black Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Pine Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2-4
- Chestnut Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Spruce Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2-4
- Rusty Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for Wolves - the Sparse Jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2-4
- Spotted Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for Wolves - the Savanna Plateau biome, in larger packs of 4-8
- Striped Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for Wolves - the Wooded Badlands biome, in larger packs of 4-8
- Snowy Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Grove biome. This lone Wolf is a rare type, as it always walks alone

When summoned in other ways (e.g. using the Spawn Egg or using the summon command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the following extensions:

- Rusty Wolf: will be selected in all Jungle-like biomes, including Jungle and Bamboo Jungle Biomes
- Spotted Wolf: will be selected in all Savanna-like biomes, including Savanna and Windswept Savanna Biomes
- Striped Wolf: will be selected in all Badlands-like biomes, including Badlands and Eroded Badlands Biomes

### ADVANCEMENTS

- Added the following advancements:
  - Isn't It Scute? - Get Armadillo Scutes from an Armadillo using a Brush
  - Shear Brilliance - Remove Wolf Armor from a Wolf using Shears
  - Good as New - Repair a damaged Wolf Armor using Armadillo Scutes
  - The Whole Pack - Tame one of each Wolf variant

## CHANGES

- The UI has been updated with a fresher look
- Decreased the default size of the spawn chunks and made the value configurable
- Updated the health and damage dealt by Tamed Wolves
- Adjusted spawning conditions for Wolves, allowing them to spawn on Coarse Dirt and Podzol blocks
- Adjusted the texture of the Wolf Collar layer to be more consistent with the new Wolf Armor
- Adjusted passive mobs spawning in Grove biome to only include Rabbits, Foxes and Wolves
- Minor tweaks to existing Blocks, Items and Entities
- Added option to use Japanese variants of CJK characters
- Added support for Viossa language
- When entities leave or enter The End, the area they arrive in will now stay loaded for 15 seconds, matching the behavior of Nether Portals
- Improvements to the Game's Performance
- Improved handling of errors during saving and loading

### UI UPDATES

The UI has been updated to sport a fresher look and to be more consistent when it comes to the layout of different UI elements, all while retaining the essence and feel of the old screens.

- The menu background dirt texture has been replaced by a darkened background
  - The dirt background can be restored by using the built-in Programmer Art Resource Pack
  - Outside the game, the main menu panorama is displayed behind all screens
  - In the game, the world will be visible behind all screens
  - Paired with the darkened background is a blur
    - The strength of the blur can be configured in Video Settings and Accessibility Settings
    - In-game screens such as containers and books are not affected by these changes
- Screen elements such as titles and buttons are positioned more consistently across different screens
- The World Backups screen and the Players screen in the Realms menu have been updated
- Lists now have clearer borders at the top and bottom
- Button tooltips will no longer appear when hovering outside the containing element
- After defeating the Ender Dragon and entering the End Portal, the End Poem and credits are now displayed with a background based on the animated End Portal effect
- The animated Nether Portal texture is displayed when changing dimension to or from The Nether
- The animated End Portal effect is displayed when changing dimension to or from The End

### SPAWN CHUNK CHANGES

- The size of the spawn chunks changed from a radius of 10 (19x19 entity-ticking chunks) to a radius of 2 (3x3 entity-ticking chunks)
  - This was done to reduce loading times, as well as memory and CPU usage
  - We opted to not fully remove spawn chunks to allow players who currently utilize this functionality to continue to do so
- Added a new gamerule spawnChunkRadius to set the size of the spawn chunks
  - Possible values are 0 to 32, where 0 completely disables the spawn chunks and 10 is equivalent to the functionality before this change
  - Default value is 2, equivalent to 3x3 entity ticking chunks
  - Note that setting this to a high value might require allocating more memory for the game in the Launcher

### TAMED WOLVES HEALTH AND DAMAGE

- Tamed Wolves now have 40 health points (20 hearts) instead of 20 health points (10 hearts)
- They no longer take half of the damage from most environmental sources like they used to do
  - In most cases, this change will make no difference given the health boost, but they can now withstand more damage from players and arrows
- Feeding a Wolf now heals twice as many health points

### MINOR TWEAKS TO BLOCKS, ITEMS AND ENTITIES

- Renamed scutes that drop from Turtles to Turtle Scutes
- Added unique sounds for Cobwebs
- Enchantments on Items are now always listed in the same order in tooltips, regardless of how they were added to those items
- Adjusted flying behaviour for Bees and Parrot to keep them from overshooting their position when flying up and down
- Llamas and Shulkers are no longer able to destroy Armor Stands
- Status effect particle colors are no longer blended into one particle color
  - All active visible status effect particles are now rendered separately
- Ctrl+Picking a renamed block (such as a Chest) in Creative Mode will now give a renamed item
- Ctrl+Picking a block no longer lists "(+NBT)" in the item tooltip

### ACCESSIBILITY

- The default focus is now always set when entering or exiting any menu while navigating using tab or arrow keys

## TECHNICAL CHANGES

- The Data Pack version is now 41
- The Resource Pack version is now 32
- The game now requires Java 21
- The game now requires a 64-bit Operating System
- The included Java distribution is now the Microsoft build of OpenJDK 21.0.3
- Added transfer and cookie packets for custom servers
- Added an option to use a faster region file compression algorithm on dedicated servers
- Added a reserved region file compression id for third-party servers to use for custom compression implementations
- Changes to optimizing worlds
- Improved server TPS debug chart
- Allowed server operators to view dedicated server TPS debug chart
- Added JFR (Java Flight Recorder) events for individual chunk reads (minecraft.ChunkRegionRead) and writes (minecraft.ChunkRegionWrite)

### NETWORK PROTOCOL

- Reduced amount of data sent by the server during login by reusing parts of the vanilla data pack
- Client chat state is now preserved by default when entering configuration phase
- Invalid data in packets sent from a server will now cause the game client to disconnect
  - To ease the transition period, modded servers can opt out by setting the appropriate field in the handshake/game_profile packet
  - This option will be removed in the next release
- The chat_command_signed packet has been split from chat_command
  - Commands that do not accept any signed arguments will use the unsigned packet, and will not pass any 'last seen' chat updates

#### TRANSFER PACKETS

- Custom servers can now request that clients connect to another server with a new packet
- When a client is transferred, it will connect to the target server with a new transfer intent (id 3)
- By default, servers will not accept incoming transfers and will disconnect the client
- This can be changed by setting the accepts-transfers property to true in the server.properties file
- Resource packs are maintained across transfers
- In the case of a transfer, custom servers can skip authenticating again with a new flag in the clientbound hello packet

#### COOKIE PACKETS

- Cookie packets allow custom servers to request and store data on a client
  - Each cookie may be up to 5 KiB in size
  - Cookies may be requested during login, configuration and play phases — but only stored during the configuration and play phases
- Cookies persist across server transfers but are not persisted when the player disconnects
  - This allows servers to pass along information such as authentication or custom game data to the new server

### REGION FILE COMPRESSION ALGORITHM

- Added a dedicated server configuration property region-file-compression with 3 possible values:
  - deflate, the default option. Uses the old algorithm
  - lz4 uses LZ4 algorithm, which requires less CPU time to compress and decompress but uses more disk space
  - none does not compress the data
    - This consumes significantly more space and requires significant time to read and write, even though CPU is used less
    - Might make sense together with filesystem level compression
- Changing the compression algorithm will not automatically recompress the world
  - New or updated chunks will use the newly configured algorithm, but the old ones will stay in the previous format

### RESERVED COMPRESSION ID FOR THIRD-PARTY SERVERS

- Compression id 127 can now be used for custom implementations of region file compression
- When used, the version id must be followed by a namespaced string representing the custom algorithm used

### WORLD OPTIMIZING CHANGES

- Optimizing singleplayer worlds and running a dedicated server with the forceUpgrade option now also upgrades contentsof entities and poi directories of the world
- Added a new recreateRegionFiles dedicated server startup parameter
  - It will trigger world optimization similar to forceUpgrade, but will also rewrite all the chunks independentlyof whether they have been upgraded
  - This will create fresh and defragmented region files
  - Using this parameter after changing the region-file-compression server property will recompress all region filesin the new format

### IMPROVED THE SERVER TPS DEBUG CHART

- As before, it is accessible by pressing F3 + 2
- The bottom dark red section of the chart displays the time spent during the main logic of the server tick
  - This is equivalent to the value displayed in the old chart
- The light brown section displays time spent running scheduled tasks
- The purple section displays time spent executing all other code during the tick
- The top light green (or yellow or red depending on lag) section displays time spent idling, waiting for next tick
- The min, avg, max aggregate values are based on the sum of the first 3 sections
- Server operators can now view the TPS debug chart while connected to their dedicated server

### CHAT

- Client chat state (on-screen messages and chat input history) is now preserved by client when entering and exiting configuration phase
- Message signature chain handling remains unchanged - going into configuration phase starts a new session
- If the client has a message delay configured, any pending messages will be delivered immediately before leaving the world
- The server can clear chat state by sending a reset_chat packet in configuration phase

## DATA PACK VERSIONS 27 THROUGH 41

The Data Pack version used by the game is now 41. These are the changes compared to version 26, used in 1.20.4.

- Renamed scute item to turtle_scute
- Changed Item Stack data format, introducing Item Stack Components
- Added many new Attributes
- Added new loot functions
- Added new advancement predicates
- Added new tags
- Recipe results can now specify component data
- Added data-driven registries for Banner Patterns and Wolf Variants
- Particle representation in commands and area effect clouds has been changed

### ITEM DATA FORMAT

We have made some large changes to how Item Stack-specific properties are stored and represented in this release, replacing the current NBT 'tag' with structured 'components'.

This change has been made in order to:

- Validate item properties at load time, enabling easier identification of invalid data in commands and data packs
  - This should avoid any 'silent' breakages in commands specifying custom item data for any potential future format changes
- Continue to evolve the game to enable the creation of dynamic content
- Improve performance in cases where the game needs to frequently look up some property of an item (e.g. Armor Trims rendering every frame)
- We understand that this is a significant breaking change for many datapacks and custom maps which will require significant effort to upgrade

We do however believe that this builds critical foundations for future extensibility. We have taken care to ship these changes all at once, with the hope that this avoids future incremental changes requiring many small updates to packs.

The current NBT 'tag' has existed for quite some time, and we are aware that a lot of clever techniques have been developed with this for commands and data packs. Over the course of the snapshot series, we have hugely appreciated your feedback on these changes, allowing us to avoid (often undocumented) functionality being lost without suitable alternatives.

- Unstructured NBT data attached to stacks of items (tag field) has been replaced with structured 'components'
  - This data is parsed and validated when the item is loaded
  - This should improve performance in certain scenarios (e.g. Armor Trim rendering) when item data was frequently compared or requested and parsed
  - Custom data can still be stored in the minecraft:custom_data component
- Item types (e.g. minecraft:stick) hold a set of default components on an item that individual item stacks can override
- The format of serialized items and items in data packs has been updated for consistency and to support components
- Item syntax in commands has been updated to support components
- When advanced tooltips are enabled (F3+H), the number of components will be displayed instead of number of tags
- Default component values for items are now listed in items.json generated in reports directory
- Block definitions are now added to blocks.json report (note: those definitions are not used yet and present only for informational purposes)

#### MIGRATED ITEM STACK COMPONENTS

- A new components field stores all components attached to an item
  - Format: map of component id to component value (varies by component id)
    - e.g. {..., components: {'minecraft:damage': 12}}
    - Components with a ! prefix (e.g. "!minecraft:damage": {}) will cause this component to be removed
  - Components equal to their default value on the target item will not be stored
- The item stack format no longer represents empty stacks (air item, or count 0)
  - Instead, in places that support it, the field should be omitted
  - In some cases, such as lists of stacks (e.g. HandItems in living entities), an empty map ({}) is used to represent empty stacks

### ENTITY & BLOCK ENTITY DATA FORMATS

- Non-default components on item stacks are now stored when a block entity is placed from that item stack
- The storage format of block positions in entities and block entities has been updated
- Added body_armor_item and body_armor_drop_chance to all entities that currently have HandItems and ArmorItems, and handle the same way as HandItems and ArmorItems

  - amplifier: 0
  - duration: 0
  - ambient: false
  - show_particles: true
- FactorCalculationData has been removed from mob effect instance tags
- Tipped Arrows no longer store their applied potion effects

  - Color -\> potion_contents.custom_color
  - effects -\> potion_contents.custom_effects
- Banners now store applied patterns in the same format as the minecraft:banner_patterns component in a patterns field:
  - Patterns\[\].Pattern (string short id) -\> patterns\[\].pattern (string pattern registry id)
  - Patterns\[\].Color (integer dye id) -\> patterns\[\].color (string dye name)
- Beehive format has also been updated:
  - Bees\[\].EntityData -\> bees\[\].entity_data
  - Bees\[\].TicksInHive -\> bees\[\].ticks_in_hive
  - Bees\[\].MinOccupationTicks -\> bees\[\].min_ticks_in_hive
  - FlowerPos -\> flower_pos

      - Can also be a single value instead of a list to apply to all slots: e.g. slot_drop_chances: 0.0f will apply a chance of 0% to all slots
  - e.g. equipment: {loot_table: "minecraft:equipment/trial_chamber", slot_drop_chances: {"head": 0.0f, "chest": 0.25f, "legs": 1.0f, "feet": 0.25f}}

#### COMPONENTS ON BLOCK ENTITIES

Non-default components on item stacks containing block items are now stored on block entities when placed.

- Component removals from defaults are currently not preserved
- Placing and breaking non-block entity blocks remains unchanged - nothing is preserved
- Does not automatically cause preserved components to be restored on drops - this requires addition of copy_components function to loot table
- Components are stored in field called components
  - Some components (like custom_name) are still handled by legacy serialization, which means they might not be present in there
  - Contains map of component id to component value

#### BLOCK POSITIONS

- All block positions are now stored as an array of 3 integers instead of a map of X, Y, and Z for consistency

      - Default value: 4
    - deactivation_range - The range all viable players must be outside of for the Vault to close its keyhole
      - Default value: 4.5
    - key_item - An Item Stack that is required to unlock the Vault
      - The player must be holding an item with the exact components and count
      - If the field is not present, the Vault cannot be unlocked
    - override_loot_table_to_display - An optional loot table which will be used for displaying items inside the cage instead of results from the config's loot_table
      - Default value: No value
  - shared_data
    - connected_particles_range - The range players who have not unlocked the Vault must be within before particles will flow from them
      - Default value: 4.5

### COMMANDS

- Updated syntax of items and item predicates in commands
- Added slot names for ranges, like container.\*
- playsound command can now be used without specifying the player (assuming @s) and without specifying the mixer (assuming master)
- Command arguments that previously accepted namespaced ids of loot tables, modifiers and predicates can now also accept inline definitions
- Added execute if\|unless items to check and count items
- Potion effect amplifiers are now restricted between 0 and 255
  - The former behavior of effects such as Jump Boost, Levitation, and Mining Fatigue over 127 has been replaced with new attributes
- Added the transfer command
- The maximum length of a command in a function (including macro expansions) can no longer exceed 2,000,000 characters

#### ITEM SYNTAX

- Commands such as /give, /item, /loot use an updated item syntax
- Components can now be specified after the item name in square brackets
  - Components are assigned with an = (e.g. wooden_pickaxe\[damage=23\])
  - Components are comma-separated (e.g. netherite_hoe\[damage=5,repair_cost=2\])
- Component types will be autocompleted, but possible values of them will not
- Values will however be validated, and the command will fail to parse if the component is improperly specified
  - e.g. /give @s wooden_pickaxe\[damage=-34\] is not valid
- The previous NBT syntax ({...}) has been removed, and replaced with custom_data assignment
  - e.g. /give @s stick{foo:'bar'} becomes /give @s stick\[custom_data={foo:'bar'}\]
- Modifier operations in the /attribute command have been renamed:
  - add -\> add_value
  - multiply_base -\> add_multiplied_base
  - multiply -\> add_multiplied_total

#### ADDED EXECUTE IF\|UNLESS ITEMS

- execute if\|unless items \<source\> \<slots\> \<item_predicate\> command can be used to count items
  - \<source\> is the same as one used in item command, i.e.
    - block \<x\> \<y\> \<z\>
    - entity \<target\> (selector can return multiple entities)
  - \<slots\> can accept single slot (like container.0) or a range (like container.\*)
  - \<item_predicate\> is the same as item predicate in clear command
- If used alone, it will return the total number of items in stacks that match predicates

#### ITEM PREDICATE ARGUMENT

The item predicate syntax (used in execute if\|unless items and clear commands) has been significantly expanded.

- The general syntax is: \<type\> \[comma-separated list of \<test\>\]
- \<type\> can be one of:
  - item id
  - item tag id prefixed with \#
  - \* to match any item
- \<test\> can have one of 3 forms:
  - \<component_id\>=\<value\> - match exact value of component
    - \<value\> is a representation of component value in SNBT format (same as in item give argument)
    - Every specified component must be present on the target item, and have an exactly equal parsed value
    - Components with defaults (e.g. damage=0 by default) will be assumed to exist on the target item if not specified
      - As such, /clear @s diamond_pickaxe\[damage=0\] will match only undamaged Diamond Pickaxes
      - On the other hand, /clear @s diamond_pickaxe will match any Diamond Pickaxe, irrespective of damage
    - Exact matching of component values applies even for the minecraft:custom_data component
  - \<component_id\> - check if component exists
  - \<predicate_id\>~\<value\> - check item sub-predicate
    - \<value\> is a representation of item sub-predicate in SNBT format (but otherwise the same as those used for advancement and loot table JSON files)
    - Example: \*\[damage~{durability:{min:3}}\] will match any stack with at least 3 uses left
- The special name minecraft:count can be used for matching the stack size
  - count=\<positive int\> will pass only when the stack size equals the given value
  - count~\<int range\> will pass when the stack size is in the specified range
    - Example: \*\[count~{max:2}\] will match any stack with count \<= 2
  - count will always pass
- Any \<test\> entry can be negated by prefixing with !
  - Example: \*\[!count=1\] will match any stack that has count other than 1
- \<test\> elements can be also joined with \| to check multiple alternatives
  - Example: \*\[!damage\|damage=0\] will look for items without damage component or with 0 damage
- The syntax for NBT partial matching with custom data ({}) has been replaced by the custom_data predicate
  - So stick{a:2} becomes stick\[custom_data~{a:2}\]
  - This predicate uses the pre-existing NBT partial match behavior
    - This requires that all tags specified in the predicate are present on the target item, but additional ones may be ignored
    - Lists in the target must contain all items specified in the predicate, but additional may be present and order is ignored

#### SLOT NAMES

- Slot names (used in item commands and slots entity predicates) now include slot ranges
- Unless specified, existing commands can still only work on single slots
- Added new slot ranges:
  - container.\* - contains container.0 to container.53
  - hotbar.\* - contains hotbar.0 to hotbar.8
  - inventory.\* - contains inventory.0 to inventory.26
  - enderchest.\* - contains enderchest.0 to enderchest.26
  - villager.\* - contains villager.0 to villager.7
  - horse.\* - contains horse.0 to horse.14
  - weapon.\* - contains weapon.mainhand and weapon.offhand
  - armor.\* - contains armor.head, armor.chest, armor.legs, armor.feet, armor.body
- Added new slot names:
  - player.cursor - item held by player on screen
    - Note: this information cannot be read in creative mode
  - player.crafting.0 - player.crafting.3, player.crafting.\* - player's crafting slots
    - Note: this includes only player's inventory crafting slots. Crafting table (or any other slots on other screens) are not included
  - contents - for single-slot entities like item frames, item displays, or dropped item entities
- Replaced horse.armor slot name with armor.body, which is applicable to all mobs

#### INLINE LOOT VALUES

Arguments in the following commands that previously accepted namespaced ids of loot tables, modifiers and predicates can now also accept inline definitions:

- loot
- item
- execute if predicate

Values have the same structure as matching JSON files, though they are encoded as SNBT.Example:

execute if predicate {condition:weather_check, raining:true}

#### TRANSFER COMMAND

New command that triggers a transfer of a player to another server. Only exists on dedicated servers.

Syntax:

transfer \<hostname\> \[\<port\>\] \[\<players\>\]

Parameters:

- hostname: String describing the hostname of the server to connect to
- port: Integer denoting the port number of the server to connect to - if omitted, 25565 is used
- players: The players to transfer - if omitted, @s is used

### PREDICATE FORMATS IN LOOT TABLES & ADVANCEMENTS

- Block predicate format has been updated:
  - tag field has been removed
  - blocks field now supports a single entry, hash-prefixed block tag, or list of blocks
- Fluid predicate format has been updated:
  - tag field has been removed
  - fluid -\> fluids, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed fluid tag, or list of fluids
- Location predicate format has been updated:
  - biome -\> biomes, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed biome tag, or list of biomes
  - structure -\> structures, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed structure tag, or list of structures
- Major changes to Entity and Item predicates

#### ENTITY PREDICATES

- Entity predicate format has been updated:
  - type field now supports a single entry, hash-prefixed entity type tag, or list of entity types
  - Added new entity predicate field slots, for matching item slots
- The equipment field format has been updated
  - Added a new body field to match the item in the body armor slot of an entity
- Removed any entity type-specific predicate (which had no effect)

##### slots entity predicate field

- The new entity field slots allows checking a single or multiple slots on any entity
- The field contains a map of slot names (same as those used in item commands) to item predicates
- For slot ranges, only one slot needs to match for the whole entry to pass

Example:

```
{
    "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
    "entity": "this",
    "predicate": {
        "slots": {
            "container.*": {
                "items": "dirt"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### wolf type-specific entity predicate

- New wolf sub-predicate has been added to match Wolf variants
- Fields:
  - variant - Wolf variant to match (single entry, list of entries or tag)

##### raider type-specific entity predicate

- New raider sub-predicate has been added to match raiders
- Fields:
  - has_raid - Match whether the raider is in an active raid
  - is_captain - Match whether the raider is a captain

##### cat, frog, painting type-specific entity predicate

- The variant field now accepts single entries, list of entries or tags

#### ITEM PREDICATES

Item predicate format has been updated:

- tag field has been removed
- items field now supports a single entry, hash-prefixed item tag, or list of items
- A new optional components field matches exact components
  - All specified components must be present and exactly equal on the target item, but additional components may be ignored
  - Components with defaults will be assumed to exist on the target item if not specified
  - Format: map of component id to component value (varies by component id)
    - e.g. "components": { "minecraft:damage": 0 } will match only undamaged items
- Component-specific item predicate properties have been moved to a separate field called predicates

#### ITEM SUB-PREDICATES

- Some fields from item predicate have been moved to a map in an optional field predicates
- The new field is similar to the components field on item stacks
- This was done to simplify addition for future predicates and to allow sub-predicates to more closely resemble names of components they match
- The following fields have been moved:
  - enchantments - field moved to sub-predicate minecraft:enchantments
  - stored_enchantments - field moved to sub-predicate minecraft:stored_enchantments
  - potion - field moved to sub-predicate minecraft:potion_contents
    - Now supports a single potion entry, list of potions, or hash-prefixed potion tag
  - custom_data - field moved to sub-predicate minecraft:custom_data
- durability field has been expanded to minecraft:damage predicate:
  - This check now works for any item that has minecraft:damage component
  - An item that does not have a minecraft:damage component can never match
  - To check for unbreakable items, query value of minecraft:unbreakable component
  - Fields:
    - damage - optional bounds for value of minecraft:damage component
    - durability - optional bounds for durability (max damage minus value of minecraft:damage)
- Predicates minecraft:enchantments, minecraft:stored_enchantments, minecraft:potion_contents and minecraft:damage require matching component to exist on item
  - That means that, for example, matching for empty enchantment list will not pass on items without minecraft:damage component
  - Note: some components, like minecraft:enchantments have default values, so they will always match
- These sub-predicates can also be referenced in commands such as /clear and /execute if\|unless items
- The minecraft:custom_data predicate now accepts both SNBT data written as a string (existing format) and unflattened tags
  - That means that \*\[custom_data~{a:1}\] and \*\[custom_data~"{a:1}"\] are equivalent
  - Flattened string format has been kept since NBT type information can't be expressed in JSON
- Many new sub-predicates have been introduced

##### Example:

Before:

```
"item": {
  "enchantments": [
    {
      "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
      "levels": {
        "min": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

After:

```
"item": {
  "predicates": {
    "minecraft:enchantments": [
        {
          "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
          "levels": {
            "min": 1
          }
        }
      ]
  }
}
```

##### General Rules of Component Predicates

- Unless otherwise specified, a field in predicate with the same name as a field in component that matches (i.e. has the same name as predicate) will match that field value
- Those fields will usually have the same type as in the components, but will be optional
- Exceptions:
  - List fields will be replaced with collection matchers (see below)
  - Integer and float fields will be replaced with ranges
  - Registry ids will be replaced with a type that accepts id, list of ids or a tag

##### Collection Matcher

- A collection matcher is a shared part of predicates that is used for matching collections
- Every instance of this matcher will have the same fields with the same functionality, with the only difference being the type of matched element
- Fields:
  - size - integer range to match against collection size
  - contains - a list of element predicates
    - All conditions must match for the predicate to pass
    - Not all elements in the tested container have to be matched
    - Elements can be in any order
    - A single element can be matched by multiple predicates
    - Examples (when matching item stacks):
      - {contents:\[{item:diamond}\]} - will match when there is at least one diamond item
      - {contents:\[{item:diamond}, {item:dirt}\]} - will match when there is at least one diamond item and at least one dirt item
  - count - a list of matchers on element counts
    - Entry fields:
      - test - element matcher
      - count - optional integer range to check against number of elements passing test
    - Examples (when matching item stacks):
      - {count:\[{count:3,test:{items:diamond}}\]}} will match only when there are exactly 3 stacks of diamonds (no matter the stack size)

###### container

- Matcher for container component (like Shulker Box)
- Fields:
  - items - optional collection matcher
    - Note: empty items are ignored. That means container~{items:{size:3}} will only pass if there are exactly 3 non-empty stacks in container

- Matcher for bundle_contents component
- Fields:
  - items - optional collection matcher

- The widget/scroller_background sprite has been added
- The following textures in Realms have been removed: gui/sprites/backup/changes, gui/sprites/backup/changes_highlighted, gui/sprites/backup/restore, gui/sprites/backup/restore_highlighted, gui/sprites/player_list/make_operator_highlighted, gui/sprites/player_list/remove_operator_highlighted, gui/sprites/player_list/remove_player_highlighted
- Added gui/tab_header_background texture, which is rendered behind the tab buttons in the Create World Screen
- Added misc/credits_vignette texture, which is rendered behind the poem and the credits
- Split map decoration atlas into separate files

#### MAP DECORATIONS

- Map decoration icons have been split from the former map_icons.png to use an atlas loaded from the textures/map/decorations/ directory
- The process of upgrading your pack can be assisted by using this automated [Slicer](https://github.com/Mojang/slicer/releases/tag/v1.1.5) tool

### FONTS

- The ttf font provider transforms have been adjusted to have more reasonable defaults
  - shift is no longer applied double, and now directly represents a number of pixels in the game UI
  - The font EM square is fitted to size pixels in the game UI, instead of between the font ascender and font descender
  - The font baseline is positioned consistently with the default font (7 pixels below line top)
  - This means that generally, any font with a size of 9 and no shift should look correct by default
  - shift is now restricted to the range \[-512; 512\]
- Added font variant filters to font providers

#### FONT VARIANT FILTERS

- Every glyph provider can now be enabled or disabled based on certain set of variants
- Available variants are currently hardcoded and controlled by the font options menu
  - Current variants:
    - uniform - wired to "Force Uniform" button
    - jp - wired to "Japanese Glyph Variants" button
- Filters are defined in section called filter, available for every glyph provider
  - Keys in that object are variant names (for example uniform)
  - Glyph provider will be included only when value in filter matches actual value of variant in key

### SHADERS

- The unused attributes array in core shader definitions has been removed
- The unused position_color_normal and position_tex_lightmap_color shaders have been removed
- The position_tex_color_normal shader (only used by clouds) has been replaced with rendertype_clouds
- The IViewRotMat uniform has been removed, and the Position attribute for entities is now in (camera relative) world space
- Light direction uniforms are no longer premultiplied by the view matrix
- The blur post-processing shader has been renamed to box_blur
- Added optional boolean field use_linear_filter to post-processing passes which when set to true switches texture sampling mode from nearest-neighbor sampling to linear interpolation for that pass
- Added entity_outline_box_blur post-processing shader

### PARTICLES

Added the following particle types:

- infested
- item_cobweb
- ominous_spawning

### MACE

- A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
- Can be crafted with a Breeze Rod and a Heavy Core
- Leverage the weight of this new weapon to deal additional damage the farther you fall before hitting your target
  - Try it out by jumping down toward your target, and hit them before you hit the ground
  - Successfully striking a target in this way will reset all vertical momentum and negate any fall-damage accumulated from the fall
  - Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
- Using a Mace will decrease its durability like any other weapon; repair it with Breeze Rods at an anvil
- Players can use a Mace in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks on their enemies
- The baseline additional damage dealt by the Mace smash attack is 3 (1.5 hearts) per fallen block
- These existing enchantments can be applied to the Mace:
  - Mending
  - Unbreaking
  - Smite
  - Bane of Arthropods
  - Fire Aspect
  - Curse of Vanishing
- Three new enchantments have been introduced that are unique to the Mace:
  - Density:
    - Common Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in loot
    - Has 5 levels
    - Maces enchanted with Density do more damage per fallen block per Density level
      - Damage dealt per fallen block is increased by 1 per level of Density
  - Breach:
    - Rare Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in loot
    - Has 4 levels
    - Maces enchanted with Breach reduce the effectiveness of armor on the target
      - The effectiveness of the armor is reduced by 15% per Breach level
  - Wind Burst:
    - Unique enchantment which can only be found in Ominous Vaults
    - Has 3 levels
    - Maces enchanted with Wind Burst will emit a Wind Burst upon hitting an enemy, launching the attacker upward and enabling the linking of smash attacks one after the other
    - Each level will bounce the attacker higher up in the air

### HEAVY CORE

- A mysterious, dense block which can be combined with a Breeze Rod to craft a brand-new weapon: the Mace!

### BREEZE ROD

- An item dropped by the Breeze that can be crafted into 4 Wind Charges, or used with the Heavy Core to craft the Mace

### BREEZE

- Now drops 1-2 Breeze Rods when killed by a player
  - The number of Breeze Rods dropped is affected by looting enchantments
- Added new sound effects, as well as tweaked existing sounds
- Breeze now deflects all projectiles
- Deflected projectiles now deflect in the direction of the shooter
- Breeze is now aggressive toward Iron Golems
- Breeze no longer retaliates against attacks from the following mobs: Skeletons, Strays, Zombies, Husks, Spiders, Cave Spiders, Slimes
  - The above mobs will not retaliate when hurt by the Breeze's Wind Charge Projectile
- Updated the model, texture, and animation of the Wind Charge projectile to give it a more dynamic look and feel

### WIND CHARGE

- Become the Breeze! Using a Wind Charge item will fire off a Wind Charge projectile similar to the Breeze's
- The Wind Charge can be used to launch entities away from the impact of the Wind Burst
- Players can also use Wind Charges to propel themselves high into the air
- A Wind Charge fired by a player will grant 10% more knockback than a Breeze's, but have a much smaller area of impact
- Just like the projectile fired by the Breeze, Wind Charges fired by the player also deal damage if they hit an entity directly
- There is a half-second cooldown after each use
- Wind Charges can be fired from a dispenser
- Players that launch themselves with a Wind Charge only accumulate fall damage below the y-level of where they collided with the Wind Burst
  - This means, for example, if a player uses a Wind Charge at y64 to launch themselves 9 blocks into the air, and they land back where they started at y64, they will take 0 damage.

### TRIAL SPAWNER

- The Trial Spawner now has the same two default loot tables as they have in the Trial Chamber
- Trial spawners can now only activate when a player is in line of sight

### TRIAL CHAMBERS

- Trial Chambers are now more consistently buried by terrain when found underground

### TRIAL CHAMBER EXPLORER MAP

- Struggle no more to locate a Trial Chamber - level up your nearest Cartographer to Journeyman for the opportunity to trade for an Explorer Map pointing to a nearby Trial Chamber

### VAULT

- A block that holds locked treasure and loot - find the right key to eject its rewards
  - Can be found throughout Trial Chambers, containing the structures' most valuable loot
  - Vaults in Trial Chambers require a Trial Key to be unlocked
- Can be unlocked by an unlimited number of players
  - After a player has unlocked a Vault, they cannot unlock that Vault again
  - If a player has not unlocked that Vault before, an orange stream of particles will flow from the player to the Vault when nearby
- Has a keyhole that will be open or closed depending on the players nearby
  - If any nearby player has not unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be open
  - If all nearby players have unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be closed
- Within its cage, it will cycle through and display items which are possible to eject from its loot table
- The loot it ejects is randomized each time it is unlocked
- Cannot be crafted nor obtained in Survival, and does not drop anything when mined
- Vaults are explosion resistant and cannot be moved

### OMINOUS EVENTS

- Bad Omen has been expanded to give access to an optional experience in Trial Chambers
- These optional experiences can be accessed through Bad Omen, which are now known as Ominous Events
  - They are more challenging than usual, and are designed to shake up the experience in unique ways
  - Illager Raids are an example of an existing Ominous Event
- Bad Omen is getting some changes with this redesign:
  - It has a new, shadowy icon and a sound for being applied to the player
  - It no longer triggers a Raid directly when entering a village
    - Instead, it will transform into a Raid Omen variant with a duration of 30 seconds
    - Once the Raid Omen expires, a Raid will start at the location the player gained the Raid Omen
    - Like any other effect, players can drink a Bucket of Milk to clear the Raid Omen to prevent the Raid from starting
  - It is no longer given to players that defeat a Raid Captain outside a Raid
    - Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming a new Ominous Bottle

#### OMINOUS BOTTLE

- An item which can be consumed by players to receive the Bad Omen effect for 1 hour and 40 minutes
  - Comes in 5 variations, one for each Bad Omen level
  - The bottle breaks when consumed
  - Can be stacked to 64
- Ominous Bottles can be found uncommonly in any Vaults that are unlocked with Trial Keys, and are dropped by Raid Captains when defeated outside a Raid

### OMINOUS TRIALS

- A new Ominous Event that can be accessed by exploring a Trial Chamber with Bad Omen
- This event will have players facing more powerful Trial Spawners if they dare!

#### TRIAL OMEN

- A variant that Bad Omen can transform into
  - This occurs when the player is within detection range of a Trial Spawner that is not Ominous
  - The Trial Omen has a duration of 15 minutes multiplied by the transformed Bad Omen's level
- Players that have Trial Omen are surrounded by ominous particles

#### OMINOUS TRIAL SPAWNER

- A more powerful active phase of the Trial Spawner with unique challenges and rewards
  - Provides a more challenging experience that advanced players can opt into for better rewards
- If a Trial Spawner detects a player that has the Trial Omen effect, the spawner will become Ominous if:
  - It is not in cooldown
  - Or, it is in cooldown but was not Ominous during its last activation
    - Making it Ominous this way will bypass the cooldown
- While active, it will:
  - Glow blue instead of orange
  - Emit soul flames instead of normal flames
  - Very commonly spawn mobs with equipment if they can wear it
    - The equipment these mobs wear have Armor Trims applied from the Trial Chambers
    - They also have various high-level enchantments
  - Periodically spawn potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs
    - Based on their location, spawners in an area will select a random set of projectiles to spawn
    - These projectiles will always include a single type of Lingering Potion from a set of possible effects
- Becoming an Ominous Trial Spawner will despawn any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge
  - It will stay Ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished
- When defeated, it will eject a different set of loot compared to normal Trial Spawners

#### OMINOUS TRIAL KEY

- A new variant of the Trial Key which can only be obtained by defeating an Ominous Trial Spawner
- They can be used to unlock Ominous Vaults

#### OMINOUS VAULT

- A variant of Vaults that have a different texture and emit soul flames instead of normal flames

  - Slimes are immune to Oozing
  - Silverfish are immune to Infested

  - If it does not exceed it, it will attempt to spawn 2 Slimes up until the max entity cramming cap
