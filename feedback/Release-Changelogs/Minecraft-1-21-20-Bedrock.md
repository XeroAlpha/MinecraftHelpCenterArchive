  - Only the swim game tip shows up when you are in water
  - The break block tip is the most relevant tip when you're freezing in powder snow. Other tips won't show up
  - When there are hostile mobs nearby you can still learn skills that will help you run away (movement, jumping and camera movement). But other tips won’t bother you
- Added emote game tip. The tip appears when there are remote players close to the player and the player has spent at least 30 seconds with other players in the world
- Added chat game tip. The tip appears when there are remote players in a world or if cheats are enabled
  - If the chat game tip can be shown for a player, the open chat instructions posted in the chat are removed
- Added a game tip that informs players on touch devices that they are sneaking in order to avoid having new players stuck in crouch
- Added some minor tip interruption improvements for existing game tips  
    

# **Technical Updates**

## **General**

- Removed the "Holiday Creator Features" experiment
  - Content that uses the experimental features may no longer function correctly

- Updated the "minecraft:geometry" block component to validate whether geometries fit within the 30/16 unit bounds and have at least 1/16 of their length within the unit cube on each axis.

## **Camera**

- Two new 3rd person camera experiments are now available!
- Added the 'Creator Cameras: New Third Person Presets' experimental toggle which contains:
  - New 'minecraft:follow_orbit' preset that is accessible by the /camera command and can have a view offset
- Added the Creator Cameras: Focus Target Camera experiment. This functionality can be applied to the free camera preset
  - A new free camera command that pivots the camera to track a target entity
    - Includes option to add an offset from the center of the entity
    - Includes option to remove the target
- Added the view offset to the 3<sup>rd</sup> person camera for the experimental *follow_orbit* preset
  - The view offset is anchored to a pivot point at the center of the screen. When applied to the follow_orbit preset, the player is shifted to be at a distance from center specified by the the offset
  - The range for this offset is -100 to 100
  - This can be set by both commands and JSON
    - /camera @s set minecraft:follow_orbit view_offset viewX viewY
  - A new learning portal article detailing the 3<sup>rd</sup> person camera, including JSON syntax, will be published soon
- Added starting radius and rotation to the *follow_orbit* and 3<sup>rd</sup> person boom camera presets
  - The starting radius (distance from player) is fixed right now at 10 blocks from the player position
  - The starting rotation (pitch and yaw) are fixed right now at 45X and 45Y
  - The follow orbit camera is the only preset available, the 3<sup>rd</sup> person boom preset will be coming in a future release
- Exposed radius component to behavior packs to be overwritten by creator cameras. Also added ‘minecraft:third_person’ and ‘minecraft:third_person_front’ to the allow list of presets that can be inherited from
  - This allows you to make a 3<sup>rd</sup> person camera based on the vanilla 3<sup>rd</sup> person cameras but with a variable radius.  
    The radius (distance from player) is not limited but render distance and other constraints still exist.
  - This does ***not*** allow modifications to the vanilla cameras

## **Commands**

- Music will no longer be stopped by the '/stopsound' command
- Fixed a bug where the /spreadplayers command could result in the target being teleported one block below the intended location
- Added a Max Height parameter to the /spreadplayers command, which allows you to specify a maximum height that the spreading is done underneath
- The /locate structure command now uses namespaced structure names. Structure names provided without a namespace will assume the “minecraft” namespace ([MCPE-151807](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-151807))

## **Entities**

- Improved "behavior.follow_owner" teleportation logic:
  - Entities now seamlessly resume navigation after teleporting to their owner
  - Added the "post_teleport_distance" field, allowing to specify how far from its owner an entity will be placed after teleporting
    - If no value is specified, "stop_distance" increased by one will be used
  - These changes only affect entities with format version of 1.21.20 or above
- Armor equipped to the second slot of "minecraft:equippable" is now applied to "slot.armor.body" instead of "slot.armor.torso"
  - To retrieve information about it, "query.armor_texture_slot", "query.armor_color_slot" and "query.armor_damage_slot" should now be used with a value of 4
  - This change only affects entities with a format version equal to or greater than *1.21.10*
- Added a wind_burst_on_hit subcomponent for Projectiles which creates a wind burst upon collision with an entity or block before being removed from the world
- Wind Charges no longer burst when removed by command
- Exposed "minecraft:behavior.swim_up_for_breath" AI goal component, which allows a mob to try to move to a location where it can breathe air once it is close to running out of its breathable supply
  - In Vanilla, this is used by the Dolphin
  - Any custom content built off of the Vanilla dolphin at or above version 1.21.20 will need to manually add this component to enable this AI behavior
- Added the "behavior.teleport_to_owner" goal, which allows an entity to teleport to its owner
  - This goal is designed for emergency situations where "behavior.follow_owner" could be too slow or too low priority
  - The "filters" field allows defining the conditions for teleportation using entity filters
  - The "cooldown" field allows defining how often the entity should attempt to teleport
- *minecraft:behavior.move_away_from_target* has been renamed to *minecraft:behavior.move_around_target* to better describe what the goal does, since it can be used both for moving away from the target, but also to move towards a random position around the target
- Added new entity filter "owner_distance", which checks the distance of an entity from its owner

## **Graphical**

- Particle Emitters that use the "minecraft:particle_appearance_lighting" component now use the correct light level instead of the world's origin light level
- 2 Channel textures in resource packs are now properly supported. When loaded they will always use the first channel to represent all three color channels and the second channel for alpha (I.E A normal texture would be *(R, G, B, A)*where a 2 channel texture will always be treated as *(R, R, R, A)*)
- Fixed fog JSON validation to allow for *max_density_height* and *zero_density_height* values to range from (-64,320)

## **Items**

- Trimmed custom armor item icons now appear correctly when their icon texture name includes a namespace or does not match the item name
- \[BETA\] Introduced "slot.armor.body" as an extra armor slot for entities like Horses, limited to a single armor item but needing the effects of a full armor set
  - "slot.armor.body" is supported by:
    - Commands (even if no suitable item is currently available for manipulation)
    - "minecraft:attachable"
    - "minecraft:interact"
    - "query.armor_texture_slot" (with value 4)
    - "query.armor_color_slot" (with value 4)
    - "query.armor_damage_slot" (with value 4)
    - "query.equipment_count"
    - "has_equipment" entity filter (with domain "body")
    - "all_slots_empty" entity filter (with domain "body")
    - "any_slot_empty" entity filter (with domain "body")
  - "slot.armor.body" is not supported by:
    - "minecraft:wearable"
  - Future adjustments may alter how items equipped to "slot.armor.body" affect entity visibility (intended as how easy an entity is detected by other entities), enchantments, and armor protection
- Released minecraft:custom_components item component out of experimental in json formats 1.21.10 and higher
- Introduced “slot.armor.body” as an extra armor slot for entities, like horses, limited to a single armor item but needing the effects of a full armor set
- Introduced the “minecraft:damage_absorption” item component, enabling items to absorb damage intended for their wearer
  - The “absorbable_causes” field allows to specify which damage causes to absorb
  - Absorbed damage depletes the item’s durability, and surplus damage is ignored
  - Requires equipping the item in an armor slot for damage to be absorbed
  - When multiple damage absorbing items are equipped, a suitable one is selected at random to absorb incoming damage
- Introduced the “minecraft:durability_sensor” item component, enabling items to emit sounds and particles when damage causes them to lose durability
  - The “durability_thresholds” field allows to define a list of both durability thresholds and the effects to emit when they are met
  - When the item receives enough damage to meet multiple thresholds at the same time, only the one corresponding to the lowest durability is considered
- Learning portal documents on these features and how to use them are being written and will be available soon

## **Molang**

- Released *state_time* which no longer requires the 'Upcoming Creator Features' toggle
- Fixed Molang content errors to include the expression in the logged message

## **Petrified Oak Slab**

- The Oak-Slab-looking variation of "stone_block_slab" (aux value 2) is now flattened into its own new block "minecraft:petrified_oak_slab" ([MCPE-180964](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180964))
  - Will behave like other Stone Slabs, eg. cannot be destroyed by fire, but will look like an ordinary oak slab
  - "minecraft:petrified_oak_slab" can only be obtained and placed through commands
- The Oak-Slab-looking variation of "double_stone_block_slab" (aux value 2) is now flattened into its own new block "minecraft:petrified_oak_double_slab" ([MCPE-180964](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180964))
  - Will behave like other stone double slabs, eg. cannot be destroyed by fire, but will look like an ordinary oak double slab
  - "minecraft:petrified_oak_double_slab" can only be placed through commands

## **Structure Block**

- Fixed issue where player ID was not being saved on structure blocks when saving and exiting the level ([MCPE-149183](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-149183))
- From versions 1.21.20, the player ID given to tamed mobs loaded from a Structure Block will always be the original owner's ID
