## ADVANCEMENTS

- Entity type predicates now accept tags (#baz)

### DAMAGE SOURCE PREDICATE

- Damage source predicate now has option:Â is_lightning

### ENTITY EQUIPMENT PREDICATE

- Entity predicate now acceptsÂ equipmentÂ field
- This predicate can contain up to six fields:Â head,Â chest,Â legs,Â feet,Â mainhand,Â offhand
- If this predicate is non-null, test will fail for entities that have no equipment (i.e. not mobs, players or armor stands)

### ENTITY FLAGS PREDICATE

- Entity predicate now acceptsÂ flagsÂ field
- Available tests:Â is_on_fire,Â is_sneaking,Â is_sprinting,Â is_swimming,Â is_baby

## CHAT COMPONENTS

### NBT CHAT COMPONENT

- Block variantÂ {"nbt": \<path\>, "block":"\<coordinates\>"}, whereÂ \<coordinates\>Â field uses same format asÂ /setblock
- Entity variantÂ {"nbt": \<path\>, "entity":\<selector\>}, whereÂ selectorÂ field uses same format asÂ /kill
- Additionaly, if fieldÂ interpretÂ is present and set toÂ true, contents of selected tags will be interpreted as chat components
- Works same as selector components:
  - if there are no elements, returns empty string
  - if there are multiple elements, merges them withÂ ,

## COMMANDS

- typeÂ field inÂ @Â selectors now accepts entity type tags (type=#fooandÂ type=!#bar)
- Item frame contents can now be modified withÂ /replaceitem

### DATA

- data modify \<block or entity\> \<path\> \<operation\> \<source\>
  - Apply operation to selected fields
  - Basic operation:Â setÂ - replaces value
  - List operations:Â insert \<index\> \| prepend \| append
  - Object operations:Â merge
  - Sources:
    - from \<block or entity\> \<path\>Â - copies value from existing tag
    - value \<nbt\>Â - uses NBT literal

### EXECUTE

- execute if data \<block or entity\> \<path\>Â (andÂ execute unless)
  - when used as command, return count of matched elements
  - when used as part of command, continues on non-zero(if) or zero(unless) count

### LOOT

General syntax:Â loot \<target\> \<source\>

#### SOURCES

- fish \<loot table id\> \<fishing location\> \[tool \<item\>\|mainhand\|offhand\]Â - uses fishing context
- loot \<loot table id\>Â - uses loot chest context (can be also used for advancement awards and cat gifts)
- kill \<entity selector\>Â - simulates entity drops
- mine \<mining location\> \[tool \<item\>\|mainhand\|offhand\]Â - simulates block drops

#### TARGETS

- spawn \<position\>Â - drops in world
- replaceÂ - works similar toÂ /replaceitem. IfÂ countÂ is missing, command will try to place all returned items. IfÂ countÂ is higher than number of items, remaining slots will be cleared.
  - entity \<entity selector\> \<start slot\> \[\<count\>\]Â - replaces range of slots.
  - block \<position\> \<start slot\> \[\<count\>\]Â - replaces range of slots.
- give \<player selector\>Â - inserts items into player's inventory (similar toÂ /give)

#### ALIAS

### NBT PATHS

- Can now return multiple values. When used as target, modification will be applied to every element
- When setting location and no elements are found, new matching element will be created:
  - For example writing toÂ Items\[{Slot:10b}\]Â will either found element inÂ ItemsÂ for slot 10 or create new one
- AddÂ \[{k1:v1,k2:v2}\]Â to match objects in list that have matching fields
- AddÂ {k1:v1,k2:v2}Â to match objects (selects 0 or 1 elements, mostly as safeguard against mismatched entries)
  - *Note:*Â this also works with root object:Â {}Â is valid path for referencing root object
- Allow negative indices inÂ \[index\]Â to select element from end (i.e.Â \[-1\]Â is last element,Â \[-2\]Â second to last, etc)
- AddÂ \[\]Â to select all elements from list

## DEDICATED SERVER

## PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

- Improved performance of Redstone Wire when depowering.
- Improved performance of Fish.
- Mobs that would spawn and then despawn from being too far away from the player the next tick no longer spawn.

## REFACTORING

### CHANGES TO RENDER OPTIONS

- Removed option to turn off VBO in the game settings. VBO are now always used.

## WORLDGEN

- Most of the biome related features now have a registry and their configuration can be serialized. I wonder what this is going to be used for...
- Added "Bamboo Jungle" and "Bamboo Jungle Hills" biomes which behave like a normal jungle, but have bamboo!
