## ADVANCEMENTS

- Entity type predicates now accept tags (#baz)

### DAMAGE SOURCE PREDICATE

- Damage source predicate now has option: is_lightning

### ENTITY EQUIPMENT PREDICATE

- Entity predicate now accepts equipment field
- This predicate can contain up to six fields: head, chest, legs, feet, mainhand, offhand
- If this predicate is non-null, test will fail for entities that have no equipment (i.e. not mobs, players or armor stands)

### ENTITY FLAGS PREDICATE

- Entity predicate now accepts flags field
- Available tests: is_on_fire, is_sneaking, is_sprinting, is_swimming, is_baby

## CHAT COMPONENTS

### NBT CHAT COMPONENT

- Block variant {"nbt": \<path\>, "block":"\<coordinates\>"}, where \<coordinates\> field uses same format as /setblock
- Entity variant {"nbt": \<path\>, "entity":\<selector\>}, where selector field uses same format as /kill
- Additionaly, if field interpret is present and set to true, contents of selected tags will be interpreted as chat components
- Works same as selector components:
  - if there are no elements, returns empty string
  - if there are multiple elements, merges them with ,

## COMMANDS

- type field in @ selectors now accepts entity type tags (type=#fooand type=!#bar)
- Item frame contents can now be modified with /replaceitem

### DATA

- data modify \<block or entity\> \<path\> \<operation\> \<source\>
  - Apply operation to selected fields
  - Basic operation: set - replaces value
  - List operations: insert \<index\> \| prepend \| append
  - Object operations: merge
  - Sources:
    - from \<block or entity\> \<path\> - copies value from existing tag
    - value \<nbt\> - uses NBT literal

### EXECUTE

- execute if data \<block or entity\> \<path\> (and execute unless)
  - when used as command, return count of matched elements
  - when used as part of command, continues on non-zero(if) or zero(unless) count

### LOOT

General syntax: loot \<target\> \<source\>

#### SOURCES

- fish \<loot table id\> \<fishing location\> \[tool \<item\>\|mainhand\|offhand\] - uses fishing context
- loot \<loot table id\> - uses loot chest context (can be also used for advancement awards and cat gifts)
- kill \<entity selector\> - simulates entity drops
- mine \<mining location\> \[tool \<item\>\|mainhand\|offhand\] - simulates block drops

#### TARGETS

- spawn \<position\> - drops in world
- replace - works similar to /replaceitem. If count is missing, command will try to place all returned items. If count is higher than number of items, remaining slots will be cleared.
  - entity \<entity selector\> \<start slot\> \[\<count\>\] - replaces range of slots.
  - block \<position\> \<start slot\> \[\<count\>\] - replaces range of slots.
- give \<player selector\> - inserts items into player's inventory (similar to /give)
- insert \<position\> - inserts items into container (similar to shift left-click)

### SCHEDULE

Schedules function or tag to run in \<time\> gametime ticks. Returns trigger time. Any tag or function can be scheduled only once. Calling this command for already scheduled function or tag will replace older record.

### TEAMMSG

General syntax: teammsg \<message\> Sends \<message\> to all players on the team of the player who runs the command. Available to all players on a team.

#### ALIAS

- tm \<message\>

### NBT PATHS

- Can now return multiple values. When used as target, modification will be applied to every element
- When setting location and no elements are found, new matching element will be created:
  - For example writing to Items\[{Slot:10b}\] will either found element in Items for slot 10 or create new one
- Add \[{k1:v1,k2:v2}\] to match objects in list that have matching fields
- Add {k1:v1,k2:v2} to match objects (selects 0 or 1 elements, mostly as safeguard against mismatched entries)
  - *Note:* this also works with root object: {} is valid path for referencing root object
- Allow negative indices in \[index\] to select element from end (i.e. \[-1\] is last element, \[-2\] second to last, etc)
- Add \[\] to select all elements from list

## DEDICATED SERVER

### SERVER.PROPERTIES

- difficulty and gamemode settings now accept string names (integer values are still allowed as legacy option)
- Server will exit faster is eula.txt is not set

### COMMAND LINE

- Added new option --help. Not going to tell you what it does.
- New command line option initSettings initializes eula.txt and server.properties with defaults, then exits

## LIGHT ENGINE

We are de-lighted to have a new light engine!

- Moved light storage from chunks to a separate structure
- Moved light calculation from all over the code to a self-contained place
- Moved light computation off the main thread (on the server)

- Also made enchanting table, end portal frame block and piston base block block light correctly

## LOOT TABLES

- Added new loot table entry types: dynamic, tag, alternatives, sequence, group
- Added new loot table functions: apply_bonus, explosion_decay, copy_name, limit_count, set_contents, set_loot_table, set_lore, fill_player_head, copy_nbt
- Added new loot table conditions: survives_explosion, block_state_property, table_bonus, match_tool, damage_source_properties, location_check, weather_check and two special modifiers: inverted and alternative
- Integer values can now specify random number generator (available types: constant, uniform, binomial). If omitted, defaults to uniform
- Loot tables have optional type, used to validate function usage (available types: empty, chest, fishing, entity, advancement_reward, block). Using function that references data not available in given context (for example, block state in fishing table) will cause warning
- New entity parameter in predicates: direct_killer - allows access to projectiles etc.
- this - usually entity performing action
- killer_player
- killer - primary source of damage
- direct_killer - direct source of damage (may be different than killer - for example, when killing with bow, killer will be bow user, while direct_killer will be arrow entity)
