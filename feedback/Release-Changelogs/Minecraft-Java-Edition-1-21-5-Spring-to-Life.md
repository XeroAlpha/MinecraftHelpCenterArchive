It's time to experience new wonders of the Overworld as we release the Spring to Life drop, the first Minecraft game drop of 2025.

The Spring to Life drop brings more reasons to explore both near and far! Warm winds have swept across biomes, bringing new mob variants, ambient sounds, and lush plants for you to discover. Befriend fluffy pigs, marvel at glittering firefly bushes, listen out for whispers of sand, and delight in a blooming Overworld humming with new beginnings.

In this release we are also making the game tests system accessible through data packs with the new test command. And as usual, we continue to rebuild our engine to improve the experience for players and content creators. We are sure all those spare parts left on our floor can't be that important, right?

### New Ambient Sounds for Desert and Badlands

- Sand, Red Sand and Terracotta of any color have a chance of playing ambient sounds when surrounded by another block in the same group on at least 3 sides, at a distance of 8 blocks
  - block.sand.idle can be played in any biome
  - block.sand.wind only plays when in Desert or Badlands biomes
- Dead Bush blocks have a chance of playing ambient sounds when placed on top of two blocks that are any color of Terracotta, Sand or Red Sand blocks in any biome

## Changes

- The main menu panorama has been updated for the "Spring to Life" drop
- Beacons and their beams now render beyond 16 chunks, up to the client render distance
  - To keep it easily visible at large distances, the beam is rendered thicker the further away you are
  - The beam now renders up to 2048 blocks high, up from 1024

  > **Developer's Note**: *After consideration, we have decided to revert this fix. While we do want to revisit these mechanics in the future, it's clear that these recent fixes alone didn't quite hit the mark and caused too many negative side effects for parkour, speedbridging, and movement in general*

### Cartographer and Wandering Trader Trade Rebalance

#### Cartographer Trades

- Cartographers now sell 7 new maps each pointing to a different village or other structures in a different biome
- Cartographers from different village types will sell a different range of maps and colored banners
- Some prices and quantities have also been adjusted

#### Wandering Trader Trades

- They will also now buy basic supplies from players, so it is possible to get some Emeralds by helping them prepare for their next journey - even if you don't feel like buying anything
- The Wandering Trader will offer to buy two items from this list:
  - Water Bottle
  - Water Bucket
  - Milk Bucket
  - Fermented Spider Eye

- Short Grass now generates slightly sparser in Meadows

### Simulation Distance

- Any block in simulation distance of a player, or loaded by another source of chunk loading such as Ender Pearls, may now receive random ticks instead of 8 chunks just around players
  - For example: if a chunk is loaded by an Ender Pearl or is in the spawn chunks, crops are able to grow, Ice can melt, Snow can fall, and a Cauldron can be filled by rain
  - Mob spawning, Lava spreading fire, and Lightning strikes still occur in the previous radius of 8 chunks around players
- Fire will no longer burn or spread if no player is within 8 chunks

### Creaking and Creaking Heart

    - However, they will still be torn down if stuck with a player or if too far from their Heart
  - Named Creakings are still resistant to all damage, and can communicate with their Hearts via particles
- Creaking Hearts correctly placed between Logs have a new dormant texture during the day
  - Dormant Creaking Hearts cannot spawn new Creakings or Resin
- The transition between the awake and dormant states for Creaking Hearts, as well as the transition of Eye Blossoms is now based on the fixed day time
  - All these behaviors are no longer affected by weather or dimension brightness

### Mob Texture and Model Changes

- The look of the temperate Cow has been slightly updated to have an extruded snout
- The look of both Mooshroom variants have been slightly updated to have an extruded snout
- Sheep's wool undercoat is now also colored when dyed
- The Sheep wool texture has been tweaked to remove the stark line at the back

### Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities

- Sheep can now eat Fern blocks
- Landing on Powdered Snow with Leather Boots equipped after falling further than 2.5 blocks will now make entities fall through the snow
  - Jumping or falling less than 2.5 blocks allows the entity to land on top of the snow like before
- Saddles equipped onto Pigs or Striders will now maintain properties such as custom name when dropped
- Bubble columns produce less particles and sounds when entities are unaffected by them are inside them
- Pale Oak Leaves and Pale Oak Saplings have an updated map color

#### Item Tooltips

- Crossbows will now show all charged projectiles in their tooltip instead of just the first
  - All charged projectiles will also add their entire tooltip as a subsection, instead of only Fireworks
- All container items with stored contents, such as a Chest picked with Ctrl+Pick Block, will now list the first 4 items in their tooltip just like Shulker Boxes

### Sound Changes

- The volume of the narrator is now affected by the game's configured volume in the "Voice" category
- Added new break, place, step, fall and hit sounds for Iron Blocks, Iron Bars, Iron Trapdoors, Iron Doors and Heavy Weighted Pressure Plates
- The breaking sound for the "grass" sound type has been lowered
- Blocks that are broken by a Piston now play their breaking sound
- Ambient block sounds in Desert, Badlands and Pale Garden which are only used for ambience have been moved from the "Blocks" to the 'Ambient/Environment' category

### Realms World Uploads

- Uploading a world to Realms will now enable Command Blocks by default
- It is now possible to upload Hardcore singleplayer worlds to Realms

## Technical Changes

- The Data Pack version is now 71
- The Resource Pack version is now 55
- A new entry point is present in the server jar: net.minecraft.gametest.Main
  - Automatically starts a server and runs all available game tests
- A new command line argument is available for the client: --renderDebugLabels
  - Adds debug labels to relevant OpenGL objects, making debugging rendering easier for developers
- Minor changes to chat network protocol

### Game Test Entry Point

This new entry point automatically starts a server, runs all available game test, and then exits.

Options:

- --help - Shows usage information
- --packs \<path\> - Set a folder of data packs to include in the world
  - Any zip file or folder containing a pack.mcmeta file is included
- --report \<path\> - Exports results in a JUnit-like XML report at the given path
- --tests \<selection\> - Specify which tests to run with a selection - a wildcard expression matching namespace test instance IDs
  - If omitted, or used with an empty ID, all tests will be run
- --universe \<path\> - The path in which the test server world will be created
  - Any existing folder will be replaced
  - Default: gametestserver
- --verify \<boolean\> - Enables test verification
  - Runs the tests specified with test or testNamespace 100 times for each 90-degree rotation step
  - Default: false

Example usage: java -DbundlerMainClass="net.minecraft.gametest.Main" -jar server.jar --packs mytestpacks

### Network Protocol

- The clientbound player_chat packet now contains an index increasing for every message sent to the client
  - The index starts at 0 when logging in (or is reset by configuration phase and the login packet)
  - For every message, the server should increment this value by 1
  - If this value updates in an unexpected way, the client will disconnect
  - As the protocol requires that every chat packet reaches the client in produced order, the goal is to enable faster detection of missed/reordered chat messages for custom server developers
- The serverbound chat and chat_command_signed packets now contain a checksum byte along with the "last seen" update
  - This is a simple hash of the "last seen" signatures which should be reconstructed by the server, allowing quicker detection of desynchronized state
  - This can be passed as 0 to disable the check, for compatibility with protocol translation

## Data Pack Versions 62 through 71

- The Game Tests system is now accessible through data packs and for mods
- Added new allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer and tntExplodes Game Rules

  - Items in the saddle slot can apply attribute modifiers as with other equipment
- Changes to crafting_transmute, smithing_transform, and smithing_trim recipe types
- Trim pattern and trim material items are no longer specified in the trim registries, but instead in the recipes and items respectively
- Added fallen_tree feature type and attached_to_logs tree decorator type
- The background field in Advancement definitions no longer contains a textures/ prefix and .png suffix
- The effects field in Biome definitions has a new subfield, dry_foliage_color, that defines the color used for tinting blocks using dry foliage tinting (Leaf Litter)
- Changes to tags
- Added firefly and tinted_leaves particles

### Game Tests

The Game Tests system is a new integrated system for testing aspects of the game. Each test is an asset defining some parameters for how the test gets executed, combined with a saved structure file containing a base setup.

Generally, the test framework expects to run tests in a separate superflat world.

#### Test Instances

Test instances are defined in the registry test_instance. They're small assets defining a test to run.

Fields:

- environment: Namespaced ID of the test environment to run this test as part of
- structure: The namespaced ID of the structure to use for the test
- max_ticks: A positive integer representing the maximum number of ticks allowed to pass before the test is considered timed out
- setup_ticks: Optional non-negative integer (default: 0) representing a number of ticks to wait after placing the structure before starting the test
- required: Optional boolean (default true) - whether the test is considered required to pass for the full test suite to pass
- rotation: Optional rotation to apply to the test structure
  - One of none (default), clockwise_90, 180 and counterclockwise_90
- manual_only: Optional boolean (default false), set to true for tests that are not included as part of automated test runs
- sky_access: Whether the test needs clear access to the sky
  - By default (false), tests are enclosed in barrier blocks - if set to true, the top is left open
- max_attempts: Number of attempts to run the test (default 1)
- required_successes: Number of attempts that must succeed for the test to be considered successful (default 1)
- type: The type of test - one of block_based and function

#### Function Tests

Function tests rely on built-in functions to run a test and indicate success or failure. They have one additional field:

- function: The namespaced ID of the Test Function to run

See the "Using the Game Test Framework from Code" changelog section for more information.

#### Block Based Tests

Block based tests use Test Blocks in the test structure to run the test and indicate success or failure.

#### Test Environments

Test Environments are a way to group up tests and give them the right preconditions to run. A Test Environment is an asset in the test_environment registry. Each Test Environment definition has a type field that determines its setup:

- all_of definitions apply the setup from several sub-definitions in the definitions field
- function definitions use mcfunction files as setup and teardown
  - setup: Optional namespaced ID of the mcfunction to use for setup, if any
  - teardown: Optional namespaced ID of the mcfunction to use for teardown, if any
- game_rules: definitions set any number of game rules
  - bool_rules: A list of boolean game rules to set and the value to set
  - int_rules: A list of integer game rules to set and the value to set
  - Each rule is an object with two fields:
    - rule: The exact name of the rule to set
    - value: The value to set
  - Game rules are reset to their default values after the test environment has completed
- weather definitions sets the weather state
  - weather: The weather to set - one of clear, rain and thunder
- time_of_day definitions set a given time of day
  - time: The time of day to set in number of ticks, as a non-negative integer

The game provides a single, empty Test Environment by default: minecraft:default.

#### Test Blocks

The Test Block is a block used for implementing a block-based tests. It has four modes:

- start: Triggers a redstone pulse when the test starts
- log: Logs a message to the log file when powered by redstone
- fail: Fails the test when powered by redstone
- accept: Completes the test when powered by redstone

Block-based tests are required to have at least one start block and one accept block in the structure.

#### The test Command

The test command is a new command used to create and run tests.

Syntax:

    test clearall [<radius>]
    test clearthat
    test clearthese

    test create <test> [<width>] [<height> <depth>]

    test locate <selector>

    test resetclosest
    test reseetthese
    test resetthat

    test pos [<variable>]

    test run <selector> [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>] [<rotationSteps>] [<testsPerRow>]
    test runclosest [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    test runfailed [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>] [<rotationSteps>] [<testsPerRow>]
    test runmultiple <selector> [<amount>]
    test runthat [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    test runthese [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]

    test stop

    test verify <tests>

Parameters:

- radius: The radius to clear tests within
- test: The namespaced ID of a test
- selector: A wildcard-enabled selector for test IDs
  - Supports \* and ? for matching namespaced IDs
  - If namespace is not supplied, defaults to minecraft
  - Examples:
    - \*:\* - matches all IDs
    - \* - matches everything in the minecraft namespace
    - custom:folder/\*\_test\_? - matches IDs in the folder folder of the custom namespace, with a prefix followed by \_test\_ followed by a single valid character
- width: The width of the test structure - if omitted, 5 is used
- height: The height of the test structure - if omitted, the width is used
- depth: The depth of the test structure - if omitted, the width is used
- variable: The variable name to include in the copied code snippet
- numberOfTimes: The number of times to repeat each test - if omitted, 1 is ued
- untilFailed: Boolean (default false) noting that the test should be stopped as soon as one iteration fails
- rotationSteps: Number of extra 90 degree steps to apply to the test - if omitted, 0 is used
- testsPerRow: Number of tests to place per row in a grid layout - if omitted, 8 is used

test clear\*

These subcommands clear the structures and blocks associated with the selected tests.

test create

This subcommand creates a test setup in the current location for the given test, preparing for a structure of the given size. This gives a starting point for creating the structure for the test.

test locate

Attempts to locate the given test. Note that only loaded chunks are searched.

test reset\*

These subcommands reset the structures for the selected tests, removing any surrounding barriers and placing the structure in from scratch.

test pos

Shows the local coordinates to the block pointed at in the test. If the optional variable name is specified, this variable name is used in a code fragment obtained by clicking on the coordinates in the output message.

test run\*

Runs one or more tests. If multiple tests are run at once, they are placed in a grid and run in parallel, although only up to a certain limit. Beyond that limit, tests are run in rounds where each round completes before any tests from the next round are started.

For each test, loads the given structure and runs the associated test. Each test location will have a beacon beam showcasing the test status.

- Gray beacon = in progress
- Red = fail (required test)
- Orange = fail (optional test)
- Green = success

If a test fails, the error is shown on a lectern book and an overlay.

Note that Game Tests are designed to run on standard superflat worlds. The area around each test is replaced with stone when it runs, and the running test is encased in barrier blocks.

test stop

This stops all running tests. Note that gameplay events triggered by tests may still remain.

test verify\*

Verifies one or more tests by running multiple instances of the same test.

#### Test Instance Blocks

To run a test in a world, a Test Instance Block is used. This type of block represents the test as placed in the world and is used to interact with that test, to save the structure, reset or run the test.

Using the test command to run or create a test will also place a Test Instance Block to control that test.

#### Using the Game Test Framework from Code

The Game Test Framework can also be used from code in a more versatile manner than block-based tests. For this to work, you need to mod the game to add your test functions to the test_function registry (Registries.TEST_FUNCTION).

Hook into some startup method (pre-registry bootstrap) to add your loader - call TestFunctionLoader.registerLoader() with an implementation of TestFunctionLoader. Your implementation can then use the provided register consumer to register test functions with their namespaced IDs. This namespaced ID can then be referenced in a function type Test Instance.

A test function is a Consumer\<GameTestHelper\>, using that GameTestHelper instance to manipulate the world and make assertions about the state of the resulting world.

The helper can be used to summon mobs, set blocks, query for blocks and entities and assert the state of the test. Most GameTestHelper methods take test-local coordinates, which you can also find using /test pos.

Example code that might go along with a test structure with a locked hopper containing a Cod, pointed into a Furnace:

    public void furnaceSmeltsItem(final GameTestHelper helper) {
        helper.setBlock(0, 4, 0, Blocks.AIR);
        helper.succeedWhen(() -> helper.assertContainerContainsSingle(new BlockPos(0, 0, 0), Items.COOKED_COD));
    }

More complicated setups will often use helper.startSequence() to model sequences of events that must happen.

As opposed to block-based tests, function tests failing will often produce more helpful error messages including the location of whatever failed and what was expected at that location.

### Game Rules

#### allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer

- When true, fire and lava can spread fire outside the 8 chunk range of a player
- Note: the fire and lava blocks must still be in simulation distance to spread
- Default value: false

#### tntExplodes

- When false, TNT will not explode and cannot be ignited
- Default value: true

### Uniform Variant Selection

- Variants that have spawn rules now use a uniform approach for selection
- Selection process:
  - Every variant has a field spawn_conditions that contains a list of entries
  - Every entry has a condition and an integer priority
  - Conditions for all variants for given entity type are evaluated for the position that entity is being spawned
  - Entries with a priority lower than the maximum priority of remaining entries are removed
  - The game randomly picks one entry out of the remaining ones
  - If no conditions are remaining, the variant remains unchanged from default for that entity
- Entry format:
  - priority - integer
  - condition - optional structure
    - Fields:
      - type - see below for values
      - Additional fields are dependent on type
    - If this field is not present, the condition is always true

#### Spawn Conditions

minecraft:biome

- Checks if entity is spawning in specific biomes
- Fields:
  - biomes - single entry, list or a tag describing biomes

minecraft:moon_brightness

- Checks if the current moon brightness is within a certain range
- Fields:
  - range - floating point range (a single number or an object like {"min": 1, "max": 2})

minecraft:structures

- Checks if the entity is spawning in specific structures
- Fields:
  - structures - single entry, list or a tag describing structures

### Data-driven Mob Variants

- The fields angry_texture, tame_texture and wild_texture have been grouped in an assets field, and renamed to angry, tame, and wild
- Added field spawn_conditions described in uniform variant selection above

#### Pig Variants

- Pig variants can be data-driven by adding entries to data/\<namespace\>/pig_variant/\<id\>.json
- This feature is experimental

- This feature is experimental
- Fields in file:
  - model - one of: normal, cold
  - asset_id - namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to assets/\<namespace\>/textures/\<path\>.png
  - spawn_conditions - field described in uniform variant selection above

#### Wolf Sound Variants

- Wolf sound variants can be data-driven by adding entries to data/\<namespace\>/wolf_sound_variant/\<id\>.json
- The file contains the following fields which correspond to sound events to use for the specific behaviour:
  - ambient_sound
  - death_sound
  - growl_sound
  - hurt_sound
  - pant_sound
  - whine_sound

### Commands

- SNBT literals now accept heterogeneous lists
- /data can now create and modify heterogeneous lists transparently
- The /setblock, /fill, /clone, and /place commands now support a "strict" placement mode
- /setblock and /fill have updated handling of block entities
- The horse.saddle item slot has been renamed to saddle, and now supports any entity that can equip a Saddle
- Text Components in commands such as /tellraw or /title are now specified with SNBT instead of JSON
- Text Style in the /scoreboard command when specifying the styled number format is also now specified with SNBT instead of JSON
- Text Component arguments in /bossbar, /scoreboard and /team commands are now resolved before use (in the context of entity the held in @s)

#### Changes to /setblock, /fill, /clone, and /place

- The behavior of setblock and fill commands have changed in how they handle block entity data:
  - If the block entity data is not specified, and the existing block has data, the block entity data will be preserved
  - If the block entity data is specified, the block entity data will be set to that specified value
  - To clear block entity data explicitly, you must now specify the block entity data as {}
  - The operation is now successful if either the block state changed or the block entity data changed
- fill, clone, setblock and place template accept a new option: strict
  - If specified, the command will place blocks as-is without triggering block updates or shape updates
- The replace option in the fill command is no longer terminal, and can be followed with additional options
- New syntax for commands to use the new strict option, and more flexible use of replace:
  - fill \<from\> \<to\> \<block\> keep
  - fill \<from\> \<to\> \<block\> \[replace \<filter\>\]? \[strict\|destroy\|hollow\|outline\]?
  - clone \[from \<sourceDimension\>\]? \<begin\> \<end\> \[to \<targetDimension\>\]? \<destination\> \[strict\]? \[\[replace\|masked\|filtered \<filter\>\] \[force\|move\|normal\]?\]?
  - setblock \<pos\> \<block\> \[destroy\|keep\|replace\|strict\]?
  - place template \<template\> \[\<pos\> \[\<rotation\> \[\<mirror\> \[\<integrity\> \[\<seed\> \[strict\]?\]?\]?\]?\]?\]?

### NBT Changes

- Any interface with NBT data within the game (SNBT representation, /data) now supports heterogeneous lists, i.e. ones where elements are not of the same type
  - Inserting or replacing into a list of a different type with /data will no longer give an error
  - Inserting into an array type (e.g. \[I;1,2,3\]) is still type-restricted
  - This means that the "wrapper" objects previously used to represent heterogeneous lists will no longer be observable by in-game means
- /data can no longer traverse paths with an empty key (e.g. /data get ... foo.''.bar)
- The NBT file format is unchanged:
  - Heterogeneous lists are transformed before storage to bypass NBT constraints
  - Example transform: \['a', {'b':3}\] is stored as \[{'':'a'},{'b':3}\]
  - Existing external tools will still be able to read NBT files as before, but heterogeneous lists will be displayed in the transformed form
- No data produced by the game has changed: objects such as Text Components were already producing heterogeneous lists in this form
- Note: these wrapper objects may never be observed in-game, they are only relevant to developers working with the NBT file or network format directly

### SNBT Changes

- The text format for describing object-like data in commands (like NBT, text components, predicates, etc.) has been extended
- To simplify input of data and macro use, SNBT now also supports following operations:
  - bool(arg) - converts argument to boolean
    - if argument is a boolean value, returns value directly
    - if argument is a number value, returns true if it is non-zero
  - uuid(str) - converts string representation of UUID to integer array

#### Number Format

- Either whole or fraction parts of a float number can be omitted
  - Examples: .1 and 1. are valid now
- Float numbers now use E notation
  - Example: both 1.2e3 and 1.2E3, 1.2E+3, 12000e-1 are now a valid way to represent 1200.0
- Integer numbers can now be prefixed with 0x to represent hexadecimal numbers and 0b to represent binary numbers
  - Example: 0xbad (equal to 2989), 0xCAFE (equal to 51966), 0b101 (equal to 5)
- Non-zero integer numbers now can't start with 0
  - Normally it would mean number is in base-8, but we are restricting it to avoid accidental use
- Numbers can now contain \_ character between sequences of digits (but not at the start or the end of sequence)
  - Example: 0b10_01, 0xAB_CD, 1_2.3_4\_\_5f, 1_2e3_4
- NaN, Inf or hexadecimal float representation are NOT supported
- Implicit infinite float values (like 1e1000) are rejected
- Type suffixes have been extended:
  - Integer type suffixes (b or B - byte, s or S - short, i or I - integer, l or L - long) can now be prefixed with s (signed) or u unsigned
  - New suffixes only affect the valid range when parsing - values are still stored as signed
    - Example: 240ub is equal to -16sb, while 240sb does not parse
  - When a suffix is used without u or s, it defaults to signed for decimal numbers and unsigned for binary and hexadecimal numbers
  - Note: since b is also a valid hexadecimal digit, byte sized hexadecimal values can only be written with a signed suffix, like 0x11ub or 0x11sb

#### Strings

- Quoted strings can now use escape sequences beyond ', " and \\:
  - Unicode escapes:
    - \x - two digit escape, like \x42
    - \u - four digit escape, like \u2603
    - \U - eight digit escape, like \U00002603
    - \N{\<name\>} - named Unicode character, like \N{Snowman}
  - Built-in escape sequences:
    - \b - backspace, Unicode \x08
    - \s - space, Unicode \x20
    - \t - horizontal tab, Unicode \x09
    - \n - linefeed, Unicode \u0a
    - \f - form feed, Unicode \u0c
    - \r - carriage return, Unicode \u0d
- Unquoted strings now can't start with 0-9, ., +, - to avoid accidental collision with numbers

#### Number Arrays

- Values in arrays (\[B;\], \[I;\], \[L;\]) without a suffix are now assumed to have suffix matching the type of the array

  - Example: \[B;1,2\] is equivalent to \[B; 1b, 2b\]

- Arrays can now also accept types smaller than the array type

  - Example: \[I;1b,2s,3\] is valid and equivalent to \[I;1i,2i,3i\]

#### Lists

- Lists now accept trailing commas
  - Example: \[1,2,\] is valid and equivalent to \[1,2\]
  - Only one trailing comma is allowed, and it must come after a valid element - both \[,\] and \[1,,\] are invalid

#### Compounds

- Compounds (maps) now accept trailing commas
  - Example: {a:b,}
  - Only one trailing comma is allowed, and it must come after a valid key-value pair - both {,} and {a:b,,} are invalid

### Text Component Data Format

- Text Components are no longer stored as JSON wrapped by a string
- The format itself is the same as before, but inlined directly into the outer structure
  - For example, the item component minecraft:custom_name="{"text":"Renamed item"}" will become minecraft:custom_name={text:'Renamed item'}
- This includes Text Components passed as arguments to commands such as /tellraw or /title
  - For example, /tellraw @s {"text":"Hello world"} may become /tellraw @s {text:'Hello world'}
- Note: in the case where Text Components are embedded in NBT, no distinction exists between boolean and integer types
  - To pass boolean arguments to translations, you must use the string form
- For Text Components with the nbt type and interpret set to true, Text Components will be parsed from the given NBT directly rather than converting to a string and parsing as JSON
- The format of hover and click events has been updated

#### Hover Events

- The hoverEvent field has been renamed to hover_event
- The legacy value field (which was parsed from a rendered text component) is no longer supported
- For the show_text action:
  - The contents field has been renamed to value
  - e.g. {action:'show_text',contents:'Hello world'} becomes {action:'show_text',value:'Hello world'}
- For the show_item action:
  - The contents field has been inlined
  - e.g. {action:'show_item',contents:{id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}} becomes {action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}
  - If contents was specified only as an item id, it is replaced with the full format and inlined
  - e.g. {action:'show_item',contents:'minecraft:stick'} becomes {action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick'}
- For the show_entity action:
  - The contents field has been inlined
  - The id field has been renamed to uuid
  - The type field has been renamed to id
  - e.g. {action:'show_entity',contents:{id:\[I;0,0,0,0\],type:'minecraft:pig'}} becomes {action:'show_entity',uuid:\[I;0,0,0,0\],id:'minecraft:pig'}

#### Click Events

- The clickEvent field has been renamed to click_event
- For the open_url action:
  - The value field has been renamed to url
  - The click event will no longer parse if not a valid URI with either https:// or http:// schemes, instead of simply not working
  - e.g. {action:'open_url',value:'https://minecraft.net'} becomes {action:'open_url',url:'https://minecraft.net'}
- For the run_command action:
  - The value field has been renamed to command
  - The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working
  - It is no longer required that the specified command field has a / prefix
  - e.g. {action:'run_command',value:'/tp @e @s'} becomes {action:'run_command',command:'/tp @e @s'}
- For the suggest_command action:
  - The value field has been renamed to command
  - The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working
  - e.g. {action:'suggest_command',value:'/help'} becomes {action:'suggest_command',command:'/help'}
- For the change_page action:
  - The value field has been renamed to page
  - The page value now requires a positive integer instead of a string
  - e.g. {action:'change_page',value:'1'} becomes {action:'change_page',page:1}
- The copy_to_clipboard format is unchanged

### Entity Data

- Custom data (previously present only on Marker) is now available on all entities
  - It's exposed as a minecraft:custom_data component, so it can be set by spawning items and matched by predicates
  - The component is currently stored in a field called data, which will be changed in the future when more proper storage for entity components is introduced
  - It's stored only if it's non-empty
- Updated and unified formats for storing equipment-related data on entities

  - e.g. sleeping_pos: \[I;1,2,3\]
- Block States in the entity data of Arrows, Minecarts, Block Displays, Endermen, Falling Blocks, Primed TNT, or Piston Moving Blocks are no longer allowed to be specified as an empty object

    - Valid equipment slots: head, chest, legs, feet, mainhand, offhand, body, saddle
  - If not specified or removed, the entity will have no equipment
  - e.g. equipment:{chest:{id:'minecraft:diamond_chestplate'}}
  - This affects all mobs and Armor Stands
  - The armor and off-hand equipment of Players is now also stored in the equipment field (although items written into the Inventory using armor and off-hand slot numbers still work)
- The data format of saddles has been unified between mobs such as Horses and Pigs, becoming a new kind of equipment slot (and stored in the equipment.saddle field)
  - This is a pure rename from the previous SaddleItem in Horse-like mobs
  - This also replaces the boolean Saddle flag from Pigs and Striders
  - The Saddle dropping on death is now affected by the drop_chances field, as with other equipment slots
- The ArmorDropChances, HandDropChances, and body_armor_drop_chance fields have been merged into a drop_chances field

    - When present, components will match exact contents of entity components
    - When present, predicates will match partial contents of entity components
  - In general, any component that is transferred from a spawning item to an entity should be available to this predicate
- The following entity sub-predicates have been removed and replaced with a combination of the components predicate and entity variant components:
  - minecraft:axolotl
  - minecraft:cat
  - minecraft:fox
  - minecraft:frog
  - minecraft:horse
  - minecraft:llama
  - minecraft:mooshroom
  - minecraft:painting
  - minecraft:parrot

  - count - positive integer (default: 1)
  - components - a component patch object (default: empty)
  - e.g. "result": {"id": "minecraft:stick", "count": 3, "components": {"!minecraft:damage": {}, "minecraft:enchantment_glint_override": {}}}
- The field can still be defined as before as an inline item id (e.g. "result": "minecraft:stick")

### Item Models

#### minecraft:component Select Property

- New data source has been added to select item model: component

#### minecraft:component Boolean Property

- New conditional model property has been added to condition item model: component

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: *Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future.*

- Shader program definitions for core shaders and post-processing effects as JSON files have been removed
- The shader programs themselves are still available and can be overridden
- The post-processing effects are still configurable as JSON
- "Global" uniforms may be defined in any shader, and the game will attempt to fill it
  - Currently, these are: ModelViewMat, ProjMat, TextureMat, ScreenSize, ColorModulator, Light0_Direction, Light1_Direction,   
    GlintAlpha, FogStart, FogEnd, FogColor, FogShape, LineWidth, GameTime, ModelOffset
  - The type of the uniform must match what it would normally be, or it'll be undefined behavior

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

- The field program was replaced with vertex_shader and fragment_shader
  - \<namespace\>:\<path\> will resolve to assets/\<namespace\>/shaders/\<path\>.\<vsh\|fsh\>
- type is now a required field for each uniform
  - Possible values are currently int, ivec3, float, vec2, vec3, vec4, matrix4
- values in each uniform is now optional
  - Leaving it unset is not recommended and is used for runtime configuration of the blur effect
- Leaving a uniform unspecified results in undefined behavior, you must specify each one that will be used by the shaders

### Item Rendering

#### Item Display

- firstperson_lefthand and thirdperson_lefthand transforms are now rendered the same as when held in hand

#### Item Entity

- When on ground, model size is now taken into account when determining hovering motion
  - That means that models should never clip into the block below, no matter what size they are
- Positioning of items in an item stack on ground now depends on model size and model type
  - If model depth (Z coordinate) is below 1/16th of a block, item is rendered as flat stack of items
  - Otherwise, the model is rendered as a cluster of items offset in all directions around center
  - Previously, flat stack rendering happened only for models with builtin/generated parent
