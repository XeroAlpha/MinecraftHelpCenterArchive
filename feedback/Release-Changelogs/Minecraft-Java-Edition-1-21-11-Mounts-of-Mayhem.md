![1.21.11-spear.jpg](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/41809981426573)

- Press and hold the secondary action button to use
- Damage is based on Spear material, the player’s view angle, and the velocity of both the player and the target
- While holding down the button, the attack goes through three stages before returning to idle:
  - Engaged: The Spear can deal damage, knockback, and dismount mounted enemies if the speed is above the required thresholds
  - Tired: Indicated by the Spear rotating to a vertical position and shaking
    - The Spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds
  - Disengaged: Indicated by the Spear being lowered, pointing downwards
    - The Spear deals damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required threshold

### Advancements

### Texture Filtering

- New option in Video Settings
- Controls the method used to sample textures when they are viewed at an angle or from a distance
- Available values are "None", "RGSS", and "Anisotropic"
- The default depends on your graphics preset and hardware
- "RGSS" (Rotated Grid Super Sampling) is a shader-based filtering method that improves texture clarity at a moderate performance cost
  - This is available on all hardware
- "Anisotropic" is a hardware-based filtering method that provides the best texture clarity
  - The maximum anisotropy may be "2x", "4x", and "8x", controllable by a separate slider
  - If your hardware does not support it, Anisotropic Filtering will do nothing
  - This significantly impacts video memory usage (especially combined with a high mipmap count)

Several uses of the cmd key on Mac have been rebound to ctrl:

- The input modifier to drop all items
- The input modifier to include all the data when picking a block
- The input modifier to change GUI scale in the Video Settings screen
- Stopping the recipe book from cycling through variations of items

### Changes to Visuals

- Graphics modes "Fast", "Fancy", and "Fabulous!" have been replaced with graphics presets with the same names
- Cloud movement is now the same for all players on a server
- All blocks in the world now have mipmaps applied if enabled in video settings
  - Blocks that did not have mipmaps before, such as different vines, rails, foliage (apart from leaves) and more should look better from higher distances
- Client FPS is expected to be higher for most players
- Underwater biome fog color and fog distance is now blended based on the player's position between biomes, similarly to regular biome fog and sky colors
- Environmental Fog in the Nether is no longer dependent on the render distance setting, and will consistently be applied from 10 to 96 blocks
- The color of the sky during sunrises and sunsets is now affected by rain and thunder
- When the "See-Through Leaves" video setting is disabled, the gaps between leaves are now dark green instead of black
- Turning the "See-Through Leaves" video setting off now gives a bigger performance boost than before

#### Graphics Presets

- Settings on the Video Settings screen have been reordered and split into 3 sections: "Display", "Quality & Performance", and "Preferences"
- The following settings that were duplicating accessibility settings have been removed from the Video Settings screen:
  - "View Bobbing"
  - "Glint Speed"
  - "Glint Strength"
  - "FOV Effects"
  - "Distortion Effects"
- Tweaks that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting have been split out to be configurable independently:
  - "See-Through Leaves"
  - "Show Vignette"
  - "Weather Effect Radius" configures the distance in blocks within which rain and snow are visible
  - "Improved Transparency" resolves some of the transparent geometry rendering issues at a significant GPU cost, previously was hidden behind "Fabulous!"
- A new "Preset" slider was added to the top of the "Quality & Performance" section
  - Presets, as you would expect based on gaming industry standard, control most of the "Quality & Performance" settings at once, not only the ones that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting
  - Available presets are "Fast", "Fancy", "Fabulous!" and "Custom"
  - The default preset is "Fancy" for new players
  - But for players who are upgrading to this version the preset will be set to "Custom" to preserve your current configuration

#### Debug Renderer Changes

- Same as before, do not treat debug renderers as supported features, they are there only to aid with development
- More debug renderers are now available through the Debug Settings screen
- Some existing renderers were improved
- The performance of debug renderers has been significantly improved

### UI

- Menu sliders will now "stick" to the closest available value when you release them after dragging with a mouse
- When using the keyboard to change slider values, the arrow keys will now move the slider to the next available value, not by one pixel as before
- The inF3 button in the Debug Option screen has been renamed to inOverlay
- The Single Biome Customization screen now has a search box
- The language selection screen now has a search box to filter languages
- Renamed the "Show Music Toast" option to "Music Toast"
  - Added a third state to the "Music Toast" option, allowing it to only be shown in the pause menu

## Technical Changes

- The Data Pack version is now 94.1
- The Resource Pack version is now 75.0
- The Minecraft Server Management Protocol version is now 2.0.0
- Added ClientFps JFR event
- Experience packets that do not change the player's experience progress or level are no longer sent by the server
- Added support for KQueue on OSX to improve network connection performance

### Minecraft Server Management Protocol Version 2.0.0

- Added a new notification server/activity
  - Indicates that a network connection to the server has been initiated
  - Rate limited to 1 notification per 30 seconds
- Enable authentication from web browsers
  - Authenticate by passing the token in Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header when opening the WebSocket connection
    - Example: Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: minecraft-v1, \<token\>
  - Requests authenticating this way are subject to Origin header checks. This requires configuration of allowed origins on the server side using management-server-allowed-origins. The default value is empty, meaning Sec-Websocket-Protocol authentication is effectively disabled
- In the typed_game_rule and untyped_game_rule schemas, the type of the value field has been changed from string to take either a boolean or an integer
  - Also, it now uses the namespaced ID of game rule as the key

## Data Pack Versions 89.0 through 94.1

- Added stopwatch command for keeping track of real time
- Certain visual and gameplay effects can now be controlled by Environment Attributes
- World Border interpolation is now dependent on game ticks instead of real time
  - This means the World Border will no longer move when the game is paused
  - It will also respect any changes made by the /tick command
- Changed loot function filtered to allow running modification when predicate fails
- Added discard loot function
- Added data-driven Zombie Nautilus variants
- Item textures were split out of the blocks atlas into a separate new items atlas
  - It means that the commands that were referencing the blocks atlas for item textures now need to reference the items atlas instead

### Zombie Nautilus Variants

- Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven by adding entries to data/\<namespace\>/zombie_nautilus_variant/\<id\>.json
- This feature is experimental
- Fields in file:
  - model - one of: normal, warm
  - asset_id - namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to assets/\<namespace\>/textures/\<path\>.png
  - spawn_conditions - a variant selection rule

### Commands

- Resource suggestions now show results in any namespace instead of just within minecraft

#### Added stopwatch

- New command that allows the creation of a Stopwatch that keeps track of real time
- Stopwatches do not depend on game ticks
- They only run when the server/world is running, even when paused

Syntax:

- stopwatch create \<id\> - creates a Stopwatch with the given namespaced ID
- stopwatch query \<id\> \[\<scale\>\] - shows the elapsed time of the given Stopwatch in seconds and returns it scaled by the given value and truncated
  - Default scale: 1
- stopwatch restart \<id\> - restarts the given Stopwatch
- stopwatch remove \<id\> - removes the given Stopwatch

#### Changes to execute

- Added new syntax /execute if\|unless stopwatch \<id\> \<range\>
- Allows to compare the elapsed time of a given Stopwatch with a floating point value range
  - The Stopwatch value is measured in seconds and has an accuracy of at most a millisecond
  - Example: /execute if stopwatch foo:bar ..10 run say Stopwatch foo:bar has not reached 10 seconds yet

#### Changes to worldborder

- The time arguments now specify ticks by default, but can also specify seconds or in-game days using an s or d suffix

### Game Rules

Game rules have been moved into a registry. With that, all game rules have been renamed from their previous camel case names to namespaced IDs in snake case.

Additionally, the following game rules have been further renamed:

- announceAdvancements -\> minecraft:show_advancement_messages

#### Added minecraft:fire_spread_radius_around_player

- Controls the maximum distance in blocks that fire can spread around a player
  - This replaces the previous doFireTick and allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer game rules, which have now been removed
  - Setting it to 0 will disable fire spreading
  - Setting it to -1 will allow fire spreading without players around
  - Limit: Minimum -1

### Game Tests

In the game_rules test environment the keys bool_rule and int_rule have been replaced with a single key rules. It is a map from namespaced game rule ID to the game rules value. The value type is either integer or boolean depending on the game rule.

### Timelines

Timelines are a new concept defined in data packs under the timeline registry (i.e. found under data/\<namespace\>/timeline/\<id\>.json).

Timelines specify game behavior based on the absolute day time (that which is set by /time set). Timelines optionally can specify a period over which they will be repeated.

Primarily, Timelines are able to modify game behavior or visuals by applying Environment Attribute modifiers.

Format: object with fields

- period_ticks: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat
  - If not specified, the timeline will not repeat
- tracks: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object
  - See the section on Environment Attributes below for details

Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension - see the Dimension Types section below.

### Environment Attributes

Environment Attributes provide a data-driven way to control a variety of visual and gameplay systems.

Each Environment Attribute controls a specific visual or gameplay effect: for example, minecraft:visual/sky_color controls the color of the sky, and minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates controls whether water can be placed at a given location.

> **Developer’s Note:** *This system and many of the introduced attributes should be considered very experimental, and may still change significantly in coming snapshots and releases. In the meantime, we would as always love to hear any feedback or suggestions you may have!*

#### Sources

Environment Attribute values can be provided by the following Environment Attribute sources (in order of low to high priority):

- Dimensions
- Biomes
- Timelines
- Weather (not data-driven)

While Biomes act as a source to modify an attribute by position, Timelines can modify an attribute based on time.

The "effective" value of the Environment Attribute (i.e. what will actually show up in game) will be some combination of the values provided by each source according to their priority.

For example, in the following scenario:

- The overworld dimension provides sky_color = \#00ff00 (green)
- The plains biome provides sky_color = \#ff0000 (red)

When the player is in the plains biome, they will see the red sky_color, while anywhere else in the overworld they will see green.

When an Environment Attribute source provides an Environment Attribute, it can:

- Override the value, such as the plains biome overriding the overworld's sky_color in the above scenario
- Apply a modifier to a previous value (see section on Modifiers below)

![1.21.11-environment_attributes.jpg](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/41809981426957)

#### Modifiers

As described in the above example, an Environment Attribute source may simply override the value of a particular attribute. However, it is sometimes also desirable to rather apply a modifier to a value provided by a source with lower priority.

For example, in the following scenario:

- The overworld dimension provides water_fog_end_distance = 96.0
- The plains biome modifies water_fog_end_distance with a multiply modifier of 0.85

When in the plains biome, the water_fog_end_distance will be resolved to 96.0\*0.85 = 81.6, while in any other Overworld biome, it will resolve to 96.0.

Which kinds of modifiers are available depends on the type of Environment Attribute. The most basic modifier, supported by every Environment Attribute, is the override modifier. This behaves purely as an override of the preceding value. If not specified by an Environment Attribute source, the modifier will always be assumed to be override.

Full descriptions of the available modifiers and their behaviors can be found in the Common Modifiers section below.

#### Interpolation

While modifiers describe how a value provided by one source is applied on the value from a preceding source, interpolation describes the combination of values within a source. Only some Environment Attributes support interpolation. This allows for the smooth transition between two or more values, such as when moving between two biomes.

Between multiple Biomes, interpolation is performed on values from a source after modifiers have been applied. Within a Timeline, interpolation is performed on the modifier arguments before they get applied.

##### Biomes

For example, in the following scenario:

- The plains biome provides sky_color = \#ff0000 (red)
- The desert biome provides sky_color = \#ffff00 (yellow)

sky_color is one such attribute that will transition smoothly based on position: for example, in the above scenario, as a player moves from a plains to a desert biome, the sky color will gradually shift from red to yellow. Other attributes, such as water_evaporates, represent discrete values and will not be smoothly transitioned - only the biome exactly at a subject position will be considered.

Smooth transitions between biomes are based on the biomes within an 8 block radius of the camera. Biomes that occupy a larger portion of that radius and are closer to the camera will have a stronger influence on the final interpolated value.

##### Timelines

Timelines can define Attribute Tracks - these specify how a modifier for a particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes. Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe. If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be selected.

For example, a Timeline with a period of 24000 might be set up as following:

- At time = 0, the timeline provides sky_color = \#ff0000 (red)
- At time = 1000, the timeline provides sky_color = \#ff0000 (red)
- At time = 6000, the timeline provides sky_color = \#ff00ff (magenta)

Between time = 0 and time = 1000, the sky color will be red. Between 1000 and 6000, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from 6000 all the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = 0 again, the color will slowly shift back to red.

Note: unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override, interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final modified values.

#### Environment Attribute Map

Dimension Type and Biome definitions contain a new attributes field, enabling them to define Environment Attributes.

This map generally takes the form of an object mapping between Environment Attribute IDs and their corresponding values, for example:

    "attributes": {
        "minecraft:visual/fog_color": "#ffaa00",
        "minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates": true
    }

Values defined as above will always be assumed to use the override modifier.

The value object can however be expanded in order to express different modifiers, in the format of an object with the following fields:

- modifier: optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below)
  - Default: override
- argument: the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier)
  - How the argument is used also depends on the type of modifier

For example, the following definition describes multiplying water_fog_end_distance by 85%:

    "attributes": {
        "minecraft:visual/water_fog_end_distance": {
            "modifier": "multiply",
            "argument": 0.85
        }
    }

#### Attribute Track

An Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object with the following fields:

- ease - optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolation of the value between keyframes
  - Default: linear
  - If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect
- keyframes - list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the ticks field:
  - ticks - integer between 0 and period_ticks (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe's value will be active
  - value - the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier)
    - If no modifier is specified (or override is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself
    - How this value is used depends on the type of modifier
  - Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition
- modifier - optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below)
  - Default: override

For example, the following Timeline has a period of 24000, and has an attribute track that modifies only minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance. Because the easing is constant, between tick 362 and 23667 the value is 0.0, while between tick 23667 and 362 it is 0.7.

Like other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the argument to the specified modifier. This is then applied on top of sources with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is maximum, so this timeline will only ever increase the value of cat_waking_up_gift_chance to the value specified in the track.

    {
        "period_ticks": 24000,
        "tracks": {
            "minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance": {
                "ease": "constant",
                "modifier": "maximum",
                "keyframes": [
                    { "ticks": 362,   "value": 0.0 },
                    { "ticks": 23667, "value": 0.7 }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

##### Easing Types

Easing Types control the interpolation between two keyframes by applying a curve. The following built-in Easing Types are provided:

- constant - always selects the previous keyframe
- linear
- in_back
- in_bounce
- in_circ

- x1: float between 0 and 1, x-coordinate of the first control point
- y1: float, y-coordinate of the first control point
- x2: float between 0 and 1, x-coordinate of the second control point
- y2: float, y-coordinate of the second control point

### Predicates

#### Component Predicates

- Component predicates (predicates field in block, item and entity predicates) now include predicates for checking the existence of every component type
- Those predicates are written as {\<component_type\>: {}}
- Such predicate check passes as long as the component is present, no matter the actual value
- Existing predicates for specific components remain unchanged
- Example:
  - {predicates:{written_book_content:{author:"foo"}} - existing format for matching books
  - {predicates:{written_book_content:{}} - special case of above that accepted any value, as long as the component existed
  - {predicates:{instrument:{}} - checks if the minecraft:instrument component exists (was not allowed before)

#### Entity Predicates

The flags predicate now supports new values:

- is_in_water: when an entity is touching water or a bubble column
- is_fall_flying: when an entity is gliding with an elytra

#### Item Predicates

- Item predicates in command form (\<item\>\[predicate~{...},component={...}\]) have been extended to accept empty predicates for any component type
- Similarly to component predicates in data, those empty entries only check for component existence
- The existing shorter syntax for checking component existence remains unchanged
  - That means \*\[instrument\] and \*\[instrument~{}\] are equivalent

## Resource Pack Versions 70.0 through 75.0

- Unifont has been updated to 17.0.01
- Item textures were split out of the blocks atlas into a separate new items atlas that does not have mipmaps
  - All textures used in an item model have to come from the same (items or blocks) atlas
  - All textures used in a block model have to come from the blocks atlas
  - Textures used for still water and lava are now hardcoded to minecraft:block/water_still and minecraft:block/lava_still
- To prepare for future work, the game will now print a warning if any defined sprites in any atlases share a name
- The block model and state format has been expanded to allow more rotations
- Textures for the Leather Horse Armor item and equipment asset have been split into a tinted base layer and an overlay layer

## Textures

- The texture section of \*.mcmeta files has two new fields: mipmap_strategy and alpha_cutoff_bias
  - mipmap_strategy has the following supported values:
    - mean averages both color and alpha between groups of four pixels for the current mipmap level to generate the next mipmap level pixel
      - This was and stays the default strategy for most solid or translucent full block textures
    - dark_cutout is similar to mean, but blends colors in a way that makes the pixels bordering cutout pixels darker
      - Simulates the blocks having a dark interior
      - This was and stays the strategy for leaves and Mangrove Roots
    - cutout is a new strategy that always generates a mipmap based on the original texture instead of the previous mipmap
      - Used for most cutout blocks that became mipmapped in this version
    - strict_cutout is a modification of cutout that uses stricter alpha cutoff value leading to the textures using this value disappearing at higher mipmap levels
      - Used for flowers and similar blocks to avoid artifacts
    - auto is the default value and will make the game to pick mean for textures that do not contain fully transparent pixels and cutout for those that do
  - alpha_cutoff_bias is a float field for controlling the alpha bias for cutout textures
    - Technically there is no limit for this value, it can be negative as well, but it does not make sense to set this higher than 1.0 or lower than -1.0 since the texture will become either fully opaque or fully transparent
    - The default value for this field is 0.0, and it can be increased for textures that can become too transparent/thin at distance, or decreased if it's too "opaque"
    - It's recommended to increment or decrease this value in fine granularity for finding the sweet spot
      - As an example, 0.1 is used for kelp textures in order to prevent them being fully transparent at distance
    - Only used for lower mips of cutout textures, does not change the alpha of the first mip level, and has no effect on other textures
- Glass, Glass Pane and Redstone dust now support translucent textures
- Added gui/container/nautilus used for the Nautilus inventory UI

### Block Models

- Block model elements can now be rotated around multiple axes
  - The model is first rotated around X, then Y, then Z
  - New fields:
    - x - rotation around the X axis in degrees, float, defaults to 0.0
    - y - rotation around the Y axis in degrees, float, defaults to 0.0
    - z - rotation around the Z axis in degrees, float, defaults to 0.0
  - The existing fields axis and angle can still be used
    - If both field sets are present, the older notation takes precedence
- The existing restriction for angle values limiting them to \[-45, 45\] has been removed
  - Note: The names of faces are not influenced by rotation. Features that depend on them, like culling, will always use original directions

### Block State Model Dispatch

- Variants in block state dispatch files (defined in assets/.../blockstates/ can now also be rotated around the Z axis
  - New optional field z has the same format as existing x and y fields: an integer with allowed values of 0 (default), 90, 180 and 270
  - The rotation around the Z axis is applied after X and Y

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

- New shaders have been introduced to perform GPU-based sprite animations
  - Added animate_sprite\* core shaders, which use a new SpriteAnimationInfo uniform
- Added block.vsh/fsh which copies terrain.vsh/fsh and handles ad-hoc blocks (e.g. held by entities)
- Added ChunkSection uniform, used by terrain.vsh (which replaces DynamicTransforms)
- The Globals uniform now has camera coordinates

#### Sprite Animations

- Sprites (textures as part of a larger atlas) are now animated on the GPU rather than per-tick on the CPU
- For regular frame-based animations, animate_sprite.vsh and animate_sprite_blit.fsh are used to perform the draw
- For interpolated animations, animate_sprite.vsh and animate_sprite_interpolate.fsh are used to perform the draw
- The UBO SpriteAnimationInfo contains information on where the sprite should be drawn to, within the greater texture atlas
