A new update has been released to address a few issues with the 1.21.60 release. This update will be rolling out to the various platforms as they become available throughout the day - thank you for your patience!

# Fixes and Features:

## General

- Fixed an issue that could cause players to see an error message when attempting to join their Realm

## User Interface

- Keep Inventory is back to being a cheat on all difficulties. ([BDS-19921](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-19921))
- Touch controls: Fixed a bug where a player could stay moving diagonally after opening a menu ([MCPE-190308](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190308))

## Stability and Performance

- Fixed a crash that would occur while loading or creating a project in the editor due to custom blocks accessing material instances before they were loaded.

## Mobs

- Hoglins and Zoglins can now be consistently hit by projectiles again

## Blocks

- Fixed an issue where the Lectern would randomly tick and emit a Redstone signal
