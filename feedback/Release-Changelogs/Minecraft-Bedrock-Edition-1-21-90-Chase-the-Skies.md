# Features and Bug Fixes

## Blocks

### Dried Ghast

- Can be found in the Nether in Nether Fossil structures
- Can be crafted with 1 Soul Sand Block and 8 Ghast Tears
- When waterlogged it undergoes 3 states over about 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob
- Makes sounds and shows particles depending on state
- If mined during the waterlogging, it will revert to its “dry” state regardless of what state it has reached during waterlogging
- Will revert states back to its initial “dry” state when it is taken away from being waterlogged, using the same time scale
- Piglins can give Dried Ghast Blocks when bartered with
- Added new achievement *"Stay Hydrated!"*

### Mobs

#### Ghastling

Ghastling is a young version of the Happy Ghast mob

- Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes

- After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow:

  1.  Players within a 16-block radius *or*
  2.  An adult, non-aquatic passive mob (and some neutral mobs) within a 16-block radius

- If no player or suitable mob is close around the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or was last interacted with)

- Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs

- Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes (or faster if fed Snowballs)

- Can be summoned using the command: /summon happy_ghast ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_baby

#### Happy Ghast

The Happy Ghast is a new flying mount that can carry up to four players

- Spawns from a Ghastling after about 20 minutes (or faster if Ghastling is fed Snowballs)
- Can be equipped with a harness and then be mounted by up to 4 players
- Tempted by Snowballs and Harness. Harness tempting only works if the Happy Ghast is unharnessed
- Has no panic behavior when taking damage
- Cannot be bred
- Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds are rendered
- The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting in front of the Happy Ghast, just above its face
- When a player mounts, the goggles on the Happy Ghast go down to cover its eyes, indicating that it can now be controlled
- Other players who mount after the pilot is mounted, are placed in slots on each side of the Happy Ghast, starting clockwise from the “pilot” player
- Pressing crouch button dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast
- If the Happy Ghast detects players on top of it, it then ceases all movement and aligns to the closest cardinal horizontal direction
- This happens regardless of it having a harness equipped or not
- 3rd person camera is moved back when player is mounted on the Happy Ghast
- When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, the goggles go up and the Happy Ghast starts to roam around the home position
- If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it resumes roaming
- Cannot enter Boats
- Idles around within 64 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or last was interacted with)
- If wearing a harness, the Happy Ghast idles closer to the home position (within 32 blocks)
- The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming on its own

### Items

#### Harness

Harness is a new item that can be equipped on a Happy Ghast to allow players to ride it

- Crafted out of 3 Leather, 2 Glass Blocks and 1 Wool Block, the Harness will have the same color as the Wool Block used when crafting
- Can be re-dyed
- Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast
- Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast
- Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears but only when no players are mounted

### Locator Bar

- The Locator Bar is a new UI element on the Player HUD that displays the direction of other Players in the World
- When there are multiple Players in a World, the Locator Bar will appear on-screen for each Player, replacing the Experience Bar. The Player Level number will still be visible as before above the Locator Bar
- The Locator Bar will display colored indicators when the camera is facing within 120 degrees towards another Player. If another Player is 30 degrees above or below the camera's viewport (the screen) an up or down arrow will be displayed
- Crouching will hide the Player, preventing their indicator from appearing on the Locator Bar of other Players
- Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar
- A Mob Head or a Carved Pumpkin will similarly hide Players from the Locator Bar when worn in the head slot.
- Using a Potion of Invisibility will also hide players from the Locator Bar

### Saddles Updates

- We are making Saddles craftable and generally making it easier to remove them from mobs by using Shears. We have also added Leather to some loot tables instead of Saddles

#### Crafting Saddles

- Saddles can now be crafted with 3 Leather and 1 Iron Ingot

- Recipe popup happens when a player picks up their first Leather

#### Loot Table Changes

Some loot tables have had Saddles removed from them and replaced with 1-5 Leather:

- Monster Room chests
- Ancient City chests
- Desert Pyramid chests
- Jungle Pyramid chests
- Stronghold altar chests

### Leashing Updates

We are expanding the functionality of leads, to make it possible to leash any leashable entity to another leashable entity and by doing so create chains of leashed entities

- Attaching a leashed entity to another entity and using Shears to cut leashes now take precedence over other interactions

  - Example: Attempting to shear a leashed Sheep will now un-leash it instead of shearing it

- Leash break distance is now calculated between the centers of the two entities' collision boxes, aligning with the rest of the leash physics calculations

#### Elytra

- Using a Firework Rocket to boost while flying with an Elytra now causes leashed mobs to unleash

#### Leash Knots

- Entities can now be leashed to a pre-existing Leash Knot by interacting with it
- Players can retrieve entities tied to a Leash Knot by interacting with it

#### Leashing Entities to Other Entities

Any leashable entity can now be leashed to any other leashable entity

- To leash an entity to another entity, the player must:
  - Have the entity already leashed to themselves
  - Sneak and interact with the target entity while holding the leash
- Leashed entities can now be "stolen" by leashing them again, transferring ownership to the player
- If re-leashing an entity would result in immediate leash snapping due to distance, the re-leashing cannot be done
- To prevent erratic behavior when leashed to each other, Llamas that are leashed no longer attempt to form caravans
- A leashed entity cannot be leashed to itself
- Baby mobs can only be leashed one way - to another entity; they cannot have other mobs leashed to them
- Known issue: When two mobs are connected, it results in the lead being rendered with an erroneous y-axis offset and appearing below one of the mobs

#### Physics

All leashable entities now behave more naturally when being pulled

- When leashed to a Happy Ghast, Horses, Camels, Donkeys, Mules, Boats, Chest Boats, and Sniffers now adjust their position gradually over time, aligning smoothly with their leash holder when suspended mid-air
- In all other cases, entities align to the direction they are being pulled and no longer behave erratically when suspended mid-air
- Mid-air friction now applies to Boats just like any other entity, meaning they can no longer orbit the player or behave excessively bouncily
- The distance at which leashes break has been increased to 12 blocks, except for the Happy Ghast, which has a leash break distance of 16 blocks
- When dragged on the leash, leashed objects will now orient themselves towards the leasher
- The distance between centers of entities bounding boxes, rather than their feet is used to determine the distance between two leashed entities

#### Rendering

- Boats and large leashable mobs that cannot fit in a Boat (Horses, Donkeys, Mules, Camels, and Sniffers) when leashed to a Happy Ghast are rendered with four leashes instead of one
- In this configuration, the harnessed Happy Ghast also features a custom rope layer wrapping around it

#### Shearing Updates

- Shears can now be used on leashed entities to unleash them, removing both incoming and outgoing leash connections

- Shears can now be used to remove Leash Knots

- Players cannot cut other players' leashes

- Dispensers can now use shears to unleash leashed entities

- Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets can now be removed from the mobs they can be equipped on by using Shears

- Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets cannot be removed by using Shears while the mob has a rider

- Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets cannot be removed by using Shears while the player is sneaking

- Saddles cannot be removed from Ravagers using Shears

- Dispensers with Shears cannot remove Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, or Carpets equipped on mobs

- Removing Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets using Shears now plays custom sounds

### Music

- Added the following new music tracks by Amos Roddy to Cherry Groves, Forest, Desert, Grove, and Lush Cave Biomes:
  - Below and Above
  - Broken Clocks
  - Fireflies
  - Lilypad
  - O's Piano
- Added a new Music Disc with the track "Tears" by Amos Roddy
- The Ghast now drops the "Tears" Music Disc when killed by a Fireball deflected by a Player

### Vibrant Visuals

- Vibrant Visuals is Minecraft's biggest official visual enhancement - delivering a dazzling cosmetic upgrade with a new modern graphics pipeline and an array of visual improvements. Sunrises are more vivid, water reflects, forests become shaded, and more!
- Vibrant Visuals preserves what makes Minecraft uniquely special - pixelated shadows, caustics, and reflections have been carefully crafted to preserve and enhance Minecraft's signature blocky style
- With updated textures for blocks, items, and more that decide how different light sources interact with them, builds will become more vivid and visually interesting!
- Updated art settings and post-processing effects tie the visuals together in a signature Minecraft way
- As a cosmetic enhancement to the game, Vibrant Visuals does not impact Minecraft's gameplay, meaning you can play on Realms with friends whether they have Vibrant Visuals enabled or not (Realms subscription sold separately. Multiplayer functionality will require platform specific online subscriptions, also sold separately)

#### Graphical

- Made Vibrant Visuals the default graphics mode for supported devices

- To switch to Vibrant Visuals on Xbox One, Xbox One S, PlayStation 4, and some Android devices, players need to select "Vibrant Visuals" in the Video menu using the Graphics Mode drop-down. Performance may degrade for these devices.

### Editor

We are excited to announce Editor v1.0.0! With this milestone Editor is officially out of beta. To learn more about Editor and its multiblock world editing capabilities, check out the documents [HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/bedrockeditor/?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable), or learn how to build an Editor Extension [HERE](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor)

#### Feature Highlights in Editor v1.0.0

##### Updated Movement Controls

Editor just got a serious upgrade! 🎮 We've revamped the movement controls to make navigation smoother and more intuitive. The default up/down keys are now E and Q, freeing up Shift and Space for other actions. You can now toggle mouse mode with the T key, and scroll zooms toward your cursor for better control. We've also added middle-click drag to pan across the XZ plane, plus Z and C keys to orbit around your block cursor. Need a broader view? Use SHIFT+Z and SHIFT+C to orbit around your entire selection. Dive in and explore with ease! 🧭

##### Vibrant Visual Settings Improvements

We've made it easier to fine-tune your visual style with updates to Vibrant Visual Settings! 🌇 New controls give you more flexibility when adjusting lighting, atmosphere, and other visual elements. We've also added time-of-day scrubbers, so you can instantly see how your settings look across different times of day—making it simpler to achieve the perfect mood for your world.

![editoru9.png](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/37424354517517)

##### Pick blocks by color in the Block Picker

Building just got more colorful! 🌈 You can now filter blocks by color in the Block Picker, making it easier to focus on aesthetics over specific block types. Whether you're going for bold gradients or matching a vibe, this new feature helps you create highly visual builds with ease. Let your creativity shine! 🎨✨

##### Hollow Selection Trim Action

Added a new Hollow trim action to Selection. This trim action converts your current selection into a new selection volume representing only the fully enclosed non-air blocks—perfect for hollowing out brush-shaped structures and creating internal spaces with ease.

##### Line Tool Improvements

Added new mouse controls and hotkeys to the Line Tool for faster, more flexible editing. You can now left-click to add connected points or Ctrl+click to add disconnected ones. New shortcuts let you nudge points, adjust line thickness, convert to selection, and more—all designed to streamline your building workflow.

        "example_namespace:example_component4": true,
        "example_namespace:example_component5": {
            "stuff": 4
        },
    }  

- Custom components v2 experiment no longer required to use custom components v2
- Custom components v2 is available in JSON versions 1.21.90 and higher
- "minecraft:custom_components" deprecated in 1.21.90
- Fix for incorrect normals and/or crashes when holding certain items in hand with Vibrant Visuals enabled

### Gameplay

- Fixed issue with the player_relative control scheme that made it really hard to travel directly forward or directly backwards

- Fixed an issue where the player's head would sometimes jitter when using certain control schemes

- Fixed the default control schemes for all cameras

- Fixed the minecraft:follow_orbit camera not having the correct control scheme in its allow list

- Fixed the camera_relative_strafe control scheme

- Deprecated align_target_and_camera_forward. Use control_scheme to switch between control schemes instead

### Goals

- "minecraft:rideable" component's "dismount_mode" is now correctly applied when passengers are forced to dismount by the "minecraft:behavior.float" goal

### Graphical

- Added the ability to data-drive some of the Vibrant Visuals / Deferred Graphics related settings per biome. Creators can provide multiple versions of atmospherics, color grading, lighting and/or water configurations as long as each has a unique identifier and file name. The reserved JSON names for each group of settings (e.g., lighting/global.json) will continue to function as before. Creators can utilize the minecraft:atmosphere_identifier, minecraft:color_grading_identifier, minecraft:lighting_identifier, and minecraft:water_identifier in Client Biome JSONs to connect particular rendering settings to a given biome. Note that certain parameters, such as tone mapping operators, caustics and wave simulation on/off cannot be customized per biome at this time. Parameters will be spatially blended as players move between biomes. See updated Creator Documentation for more details

- Particles rendered without the "minecraft:particle_appareance_lighting" component are now rendered as expected in Vibrant Visuals

- Removed ';' debug feature for toggling graphics modes

- Recalibrated all emissive values in MERS textures in Vibrant Visuals

- Update shadow configurations for "Favors Performance" targets on all Xbox platforms in Vibrant Visuals mode

- Update Volumetric configs for "Prefers Performance" targets on Xbox One and Xbox One X in Vibrant Visuals mode

- Reduced the intensity and speed of the caustics animation in Vibrant Visuals

- Fixed an issue where the screen would render black on Xclipse GPUs running Android 15 with Vibrant Visuals ([MCPE-203972](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE/issues/MCPE-203972))

- Increased emissive intensity and adjusted tone mapping parameters in Vibrant Visuals.

- Added temperature grading settings to the color grading JSON files for Vibrant Visuals. Schemas must specify a format version of 1.21.90 to access this new setting

  - New temperature object added to color_grading

  - enabled set to true or false controls if temperature grading is enabled

  - type set to either white_balance or color_temperature controls the type of grading applied
    - white_balance uses the temperature value to adjust the camera's white point. Lower temperature values will cause the scene to appear more blue
    - color_temperature is the inverse of the white balance operation. Lower temperature values will cause the scene to appear more red

  - temperature sets the temperature in kelvin

  - Example:

        ...
        "color_grading": {
            "temperature": {
                "enabled": true,
                "type": "color_temperature",
                "temperature": 6500.0
            }
        }
        ...

- Added henyey_greenstein_g settings to the fog JSON files

  - New section henyey_greenstein_g allows specifying value for both air and water
  - Example:

<!-- -->

    {
        "format_version": "1.21.90",  
        "minecraft:fog_settings": {
            "description": {
                "identifier": "minecraft:test_henyey_greenstein_g"
            },
            "volumetric": {
                "henyey_greenstein_g": {
                    "air": {
                        "henyey_greenstein_g": 0.5
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

- Items equipped in off-hand will no longer be displaced when the game is paused ([MCPE-190716](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190716))

- Fix inconsistent cloud rendering during split-screen gameplay ([MCPE-188934](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188934))

- Fixed an issue with 0 being incorrectly discarded on the g and a values of on_fire_color inside render controllers. This caused entities like the Ghast's fireballs to be tinted green. ([MCPE-218297](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-218297))

### Items

- Extended "minecraft:wearable" item component to allow hiding Players' locations, similar to Mob Heads and the Carved Pumpkin

  - The new "hides_player_location" boolean field defines whether Players are hidden on the Locator Bar and Locator Maps when equipped in the appropriate wearable slot, defined by the "slot" field
  - The default value of "hides_player_location" is false
  - All "minecraft:wearable" item components defined previously will have the value of "hides_player_location" default to false

### Molang

- Fixed query.health in resource packs to return 0 for the Wither once it has died

- Fixed query.health to work for the Wither to properly reflect the elapsed ticks since it started dying

- Added the query.is_riding_any_entity_of_type Molang query, which checks whether an entity is riding another entity of any specified type

### Network Protocol

- Added ActorFlags::BODY_ROTATION_ALWAYS_FOLLOWS_HEAD

## Experimental Technical Updates

### Blocks

- Added minecraft:random_offset component under the Upcoming Creator Features toggle. This allows for blocks to randomly offset like foliage does in the Vanilla game  
  Example:

<!-- -->

    {  
        "format_version": "1.21.80",
        "minecraft:block": {
           "description": {
              "identifier": "test:test_block"
           },
           "components": {
              "minecraft:collision_box": {
                 "origin": [-4.0, 4.0, -4.0],
                 "size": [8, 8, 8]
              },
              "minecraft:random_offset": {
                 "x": {
                    // This is the range of possible values we can pick from
                    "range": {
                       "min": -4,
                       "max": 4
                    },
                    // This is the equally spaced steps across the given range. 
                    // Provide 0 for all possible values in the range
                    "steps": 16
                 },
                 "y": {
                    "range": {
                       "min": -4,
                       "max": 4
                    },
                    "steps": 16
                 },
                 "z": {
                    "range": {
                       "min": -4,
                       "max": 4
                    },
                    "steps": 16
                 }
              }
           }
        }

- Added minecraft:movable component under the Upcoming Creator Features toggle. This allows for blocks to configure how they should react when moved by a Piston

  - "movement_type" (Required): Specifies how the block should react when moved by a piston
    - "push_pull": Will allow a block to be pushed by a Piston/Sticky Piston and pulled by a Sticky Piston (e.g. Grass)
    - "push": Will allow a block to be pushed by a Piston/Sticky Piston (e.g. Glazed Terracotta)
    - "immovable": Will not allow a block to be pushed or pulled by a Piston/Sticky Piston (e.g. Bedrock)
    - "popped": Will pop a block when pushed by a Piston/Sticky Piston (e.g. Leaves)
  - "sticky" (Optional): Specifies how the block should handle adjacent blocks when moved by a Piston
    - "none": Default. Will not add any additional behavior
    - "same": Will move adjacent blocks along with it when moved by a piston. It will not move different blocks with "sticky": "same" (e.g. A Honey Block can move another Honey Block but not a Slime Block)
      - NOTE: This field only works when used with "movement_type": "push_pull" "format_version": "1.21.90",  
        "minecraft:movable": {  
        "movement_type": "push_pull",  
        "sticky": "same"

### Block Components

- Added field "uv_lock" to **"minecraft:geometry"** block component behind UpcomingCreatorFeatures experiment

  - UV locking will allow faces to have the same texture orientations as the default geometry state, regardless of how "minecraft:transformation" component rotates the geometry
  - UV locking will not be supported for geometry using Box UVs if the box sides are not equal, in other words the box has non square UVs. Geometry with per-face UVs and non-square faces will be supported
  - UV locking will not be supported if Block Json format_version is less than **1.19.80**.

### Commands

- Added optional property liquidSettings to /place structure and /place jigsaw commands. Defaults to apply_waterlogging

### Jigsaw

- Jigsaw structures being placed in water no longer replace water incorrectly

- Added optional property liquid_settings to minecraft:jigsaw JSON to allow control over handling liquids when placing structures. Defaults to apply_waterlogging.

### Components

- The BlockDestructionParticlesComponent has a new field called particle_count allowing creators to determine the amount of particles that are generated on the destruction of the block

### User Interface

- The touch screen d-pad control now shows the correct buttons when using camera relative control schemes

### World Generation

- Terrain Matching Jigsaw Template pools will no longer create floating islands

- Namespaces can now be used in Template Pool element location and Jigsaw Block identifiers
