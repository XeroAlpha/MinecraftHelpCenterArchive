We're now releasing the Bundles of Bravery game drop for Java Edition, featuring space-saving Bundles and the addition of Hardcore Mode to Realms!

This game drop is all about embarking on a new adventure, collecting everything you can along the way, and definitely not dying. Together with these additions, we've also added baby variants of Dolphins and Squids, given Redstone Torches an updated look, optimized the game, and fixed over 300 bugs! To top it off, there's also a heap of technical changes, bringing even more control to creators.

Goodness, that was a lot, wasn't it? Perhaps we should've stuffed it all into a Bundle?

Â 

## New Features

- Added Bundles

### Bundles

- A Bundle is an item that can pack different items together into the same stack
- A Bundle only fits one stack (usually 64 items) but it can be a mixture of many different item types
- You can insert items into a Bundle directly in the inventory
- Bundles have a tooltip that shows the items inside
  - If a Bundle has less than 12 item types inside, the tooltip will show all of them
  - Otherwise, the tooltip will show the top three rows of items (at least 8 item types) and the others will be hidden below
- You can select any of the visible items to pull out of the Bundle
  - Right-click to take the first item
  - Use the scroll wheel to select a different item, then right-click to take it
- When selecting an item to remove, the Bundle icon shows that item poking out of the Bundle
- When holding a Bundle in hand, you can empty items onto the ground by right-clicking or holding right-click
- The Bundle is crafted with one String above one Leather
- The controls have changed from the original prototype:
  - Use left-click to put an item into a Bundle
  - Use right-click to remove the top item type from a Bundle
  - When the Bundle tooltip is visible, use the mouse wheel to select a different item type, then use right-click to remove it

- Smithing Template items are now named after their template type instead of the generic "Smithing Template" name

  - Enables data pack customization
- The game mode for the last active world on a Realm will now be visible on the main Realms screen if applicable

#### Hardcore Mode

- Hardcore mode is now available in Realms

### Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities

- Wolves can now also be fed Cod, Cooked Cod, Salmon, Cooked Salmon, Tropical Fish, Pufferfish and Rabbit Stew
- Bats can now spawn at any height, not just below sea level, as long as it is dark enough and there is a solid block to spawn on
- Breeze no longer have a minimum distance required to attack a target
- The portal cooldowns of vehicles and projectiles have been tweaked
  - After using a Nether Portal, Minecarts and Boats now only need to leave the portal for 0.5 seconds to use a portal again (down from previous 15 seconds)
  - After using a Nether Portal, projectiles such as Ender Pearls and Arrows now only need to leave the portal for 2 ticks to use a portal again (down from previous 15 seconds)
- Projectiles such as Arrows, Tridents and Fishing Bobbers now bounce off the world border if hit
- Being killed by a Mace smash attack now shows a new death message
- Added unique block sounds to the Monster Spawner block
- Enchanted Shields now have the same reduced glint as enchanted armor
- Items that convert to another item after consumption will no longer do so in creative mode
  - For example, a Honey Bottle will no longer add a Glass Bottle to your inventory when consumed in creative mode
- Suspicious Stew recipes are now shown in the Recipe Book
- Shulker Box coloring recipes are now shown in the Recipe Book
- Shulker Box and Bundle coloring recipes no longer work when trying to apply a Dye to an item of the same color

### Trial Chambers

- Beds in intersections now have their colors randomized
- Replaced the empty Chests at the entrance of chamber with a Hopper and Barrel

### New Mob Variation

- Added baby versions of Dolphins, Squids, and Glow Squids
  - Squid Spawn Eggs will only spawn adult Squids
  - There is a 5% chance of Squids spawned in groups in the wild to be a baby
- Salmon may now spawn as Small, Medium (current size), or Large

### Ender Pearl Chunk Loading

- Ender Pearls now ensure that the chunk they are in or travel into is always loaded and ticking
  - They also load chunks when crossing to a new dimension
  - This ensures that Ender Pearls can always land, and makes cross-dimensional Ender Pearl travelling more predictable
- Ender Pearls now unload when a player logs out, and reappear whenever that player logs back in, similar to how ridden entities currently behave

### Banner Patterns

- Each Banner Pattern item now includes their pattern type in their name instead of as a subtitle
  - Unique item textures have been added to better distinguish each pattern type
- The following Banner Patterns have been added:
  - Field Masoned
    - Crafted with Paper and Bricks
  - Bordure Indented
    - Crafted with Paper and Vines
- The Bricks and Curved Border patterns in the Loom can no longer be accessed without the above Banner Patterns

### Bee Behavior

- Bees now wander around randomly for less time after exiting a nest/hive
- A Bee with a known nest or hive will now stay closer to it, reducing the distance it travels and reducing the risk of getting lost
- Significantly increased the amount of time a Bee can take to return to a known nest/hive before it gives up trying to return home
- Bees are now a lot less likely to get stuck when on corners or when close to a nest/hive they are trying to return to
- Bees are also now a lot less likely to try and pathfind to a flower that it cannot reach

### Raider Spawning

- A triggered raid will no longer start if the Raiders cannot find a place to spawn within a reasonable distance of the village they are trying to raid
- In order for a Raid to start, Raiders must now find a place to spawn no more than 96 blocks vertically above or below the Village center
- It is now much less likely for Raiders to not find a valid place to spawn when raiding

### User Interface

- The Recipe Book now repeats the last selected recipe when a "selected" key is pressed (space or either enter key)
- Updated slot highlight in the UI so that the item texture has better visibility
  - The previous textures have been added to Programmer Art resource pack
- Tweaked air bubbles UI
  - Added an empty state for air bubbles along with a wobble when the player is drowning
  - Added a popping sound when the bubbles pop in the UI

### Rarity

- Rarity is a set of categories which determine the color used to display the name of an item or block
  - It has no gameplay impact, but is used to signal how difficult something is to obtain
  - By default, unless specified otherwise, all items and blocks have a rarity of Common which displays their name in the color white
- We have re-evaluated the rarity of all items and blocks in the game to more accurately reflect the current challenge of obtaining them, given the following guidelines:
  - Items and blocks become more rare depending on the following factors:
    - The chance of finding it in a loot table, including mob drops
    - The amount of travelling required to obtain it
    - The difficulty of any obstacle which must be overcome to obtain it
    - The possible amount of that item or block which exists in the world
  - Any item or block which can be crafted must inherit the highest rarity of its crafting ingredients
    - For example, a Mace has an Epic rarity because one of its ingredients (the Heavy Core) has an Epic rarity
    - Likewise, any crafted item which has only Common crafting ingredients must also be Common
- The lists below detail the items and blocks which have changed to that rarity category

#### Common

- End Crystal
- Golden Apple

#### Uncommon

- Sniffer Egg
- Chainmail Helmet

#### Rare

- Enchanted Golden Apple
  - Enchanted Golden Apples have become more common in recent years due to being accessible in both Ancient Cities and Trial Chambers, warranting a demotion to Rare instead of Epic
- Trident
  - We recently increased Trident's rarity up to Epic from Common, but after re-evaluating felt that it was easier to obtain than other items in the Epic category such as Heavy Cores or Elytras

    - Further limits to 10 FPS after 9 more minutes of no input
    - Also limits to 10 FPS when the game window is minimized

### Performance

- Frame rate has been improved when using higher render distances
  - Significantly reduced the performance impact when turning the camera
- The performance of the server (tick rate) has been improved when using higher render distances
  - Furthermore, the impact of loading and generating chunks on tick rate has been reduced

### Player Safety

- Added reporting reason "Sexually inappropriate"
  - This is intended for skins that are graphic in nature relating to sexual acts, sexual organs, and sexual violence
- Removed reason "Defamation" for skins due to lack of relevance
- Removed reason "Threat of harm to others" due to already being covered by "Harassment or bullying" reporting reason

### Item Models

- All item models can now use theÂ brokenÂ property in model overrides that was previously limited to just Elytra
  - This will have a value of 1 if the item has 1 durability left, or 0 otherwise

### Custom Equipment Layers

The appearance of equipment when equipped by players or certain mobs can now be customized by defining 'equipment models' in the Resource Pack.

- Equipment model definitions are loaded fromÂ assets/\<namespace\>/models/equipment/\<path\>.json
  - These can then be referenced by theÂ equippableÂ component with a model id ofÂ namespace:path
- The model definition is an object with fields:Â wolf_body,Â horse_body,Â llama_body,Â humanoid,Â humanoid_leggings,Â wings
  - All fields are optional, and can be used to specify a list of layers for the given model layer type
  - Each field contains list of layer objects:
    - texture: namespaced texture location for this layer
      - namespace:pathÂ will resolve toÂ assets/\<namespace\>/textures/entity/equipment/\<layer_type\>/\<path\>.png
    - dyeable: object with fields (optional), specifying how this layer behaves when dyed (in theÂ dyeableÂ item tag, and hasÂ dyed_colorÂ component)
      - color_when_undyed: rgb color int (optional)
      - If specified, this layer will be tinted by the color contained in theÂ dyed_colorÂ component
        - If the item is not dyeable or not dyed, it will be tinted based on the color specified byÂ color_when_undyed
        - IfÂ color_when_undyedÂ is not specified and the item is not dyed, the layer will be hidden
    - use_player_texture: boolean (default:Â false), true if this layer texture should be overridden by a texture given by the player
      - Only used forÂ wingsÂ layers, which will override with the player's custom Elytra texture

A model definition specifying both player and horse armor layers might look like:

    {
      "layers": {
        "horse_body": [
          { "texture": "minecraft:iron" }
        ],
        "humanoid": [
          { "texture": "minecraft:iron" }
        ],
        "humanoid_leggings": [
          { "texture": "minecraft:iron" }
        ]
      }
    }

### Trims

- Trim textures will be loaded from the appropriate folder in theÂ textures/trims/entityÂ directory
  - For example, armor withÂ wolf_bodyÂ layers will fetch trims fromÂ textures/trims/entity/wolf_body

### Moved Textures

- All equipment-related textures have been moved to subfolders of theÂ textures/entity/equipmentÂ directory
  - Player armor textures have been moved toÂ textures/entity/equipment/humanoidÂ andÂ textures/entity/equipment/humanoid_leggings

  - For leggings textures, theÂ \_leggingsÂ suffix is dropped

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**:Â *Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future.*

- Shader program configurations can now specify preprocessor define directives to apply to their linked shaders
  - Many shader implementations have been merged by making use of this
- The format of core shader and post-processing shader configurations have been consolidated
- The format of post-processing effect configurations have been updated
- TheÂ ChunkOffsetÂ uniform in terrain shaders has been renamed toÂ ModelOffset
- TheÂ rendertype_entity_glint_directÂ shader has been removed (replaced byÂ rendertype_entity_glint)
- TheÂ rendertype_entity_translucent_cullÂ shader has been removed (replaced byÂ rendertype_item_entity_translucent_cull)

#### Shader Program Definitions

- Program definitions for post-processing effects (assets/\<namespace\>/shaders/program/\<name\>.json) have been made consistent with core shader definitions (assets/\<namespace\>/shaders/core/\<name\>.json)
  - TheÂ blendÂ field has been removed, as it had no use
  - TheÂ attributesÂ field has been removed, instead theÂ PositionÂ attribute will always be bound
  - The provided uniforms have been consolidated with those provided to core shaders
    - TimeÂ has been renamed toÂ GameTime
- TheÂ vertexÂ andÂ fragmentÂ shader references in program definitions (including post-processing effects) are now namespaced shader ids
  - A vertex shaderÂ \<namespace\>:\<path\>Â will resolve toÂ assets/\<namespace\>/shaders/\<path\>.vsh
  - A fragment shaderÂ \<namespace\>:\<path\>Â will resolve toÂ assets/\<namespace\>/shaders/\<path\>.fsh
- Shader source files are no longer required to be in theÂ shaders/coreÂ subdirectory, this only exists for organization
- AddedÂ definesÂ field to program definitions (object with fields)
  - Allows GLSL define directives to be injected into the shader source, which can be referenced in the shader
  - valuesÂ (map of string to string)
    - Will be injected asÂ \#define \<key\> \<value\>Â at the top of the file
  - flagsÂ (list of strings)
    - Will be injected asÂ \#define \<key\>Â at the top of the file

#### Shader Imports

- TheÂ \#moj_importÂ directive now supports namespaced includes with absolute paths
  - For example,Â \#moj_import \<minecraft:fog.glsl\>Â will importÂ assets/minecraft/shaders/include/fog.glsl
- Relative imports are not namespaced and behave as before

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

- Post-processing effect configuration has been moved out of theÂ assets/\<namespace\>/shaders/postÂ directory to justÂ assets/\<namespace\>/post_effect
- Vertex and fragment shaders used by these effects have been moved fromÂ assets/\<namespace\>/shaders/programÂ toÂ assets/\<namespace\>/shaders/post
- nameÂ has been renamed toÂ program, and is now a namespaced id of a shader program configuration
  - \<namespace\>:\<path\>Â will resolve toÂ assets/\<namespace\>/shaders/\<path\>.json
- intargetÂ andÂ auxtargetsÂ have been merged into a singleÂ inputsÂ list, as specified by the input format below
- outtargetÂ has been renamed toÂ outputÂ with the same format
- targetsÂ is now a map between target name and target definition, as opposed to a list
  - Inline target names are replaced with an empty object
    - For example,Â \["swap"\]Â becomesÂ {"swap": {}}
  - Target definitions with a specific size remain the same, with theÂ nameÂ field moved into the map key
    - For example,Â \[{"name": "potato", "width": 16, "height": 16}\]Â becomesÂ {"potato": {"width": 16, "height": 16}}

#### Input Format

For both render target and texture inputs, the following fields may be specified:

- sampler_name: string - prefix to set up bothÂ \_SamplerÂ andÂ \_SizeÂ uniforms
  - For example,Â "sampler_name": "Diffuse"Â will link to theÂ DiffuseSamplerÂ andÂ DiffuseSizeÂ uniforms
  - This was previously alwaysÂ DiffuseSamplerÂ andÂ InSizeÂ forÂ intarget
  - ForÂ auxtargets, theÂ nameÂ defined the sampler uniform, and the size was given asÂ AuxSize\<index\>
- bilinear: boolean (default:Â false) - if true, the input will be sampled with a bilinear filter
  - This formerly only existed on texture inputs, however now functions for render targets
  - For render targets, replaces the now removedÂ use_linear_filterÂ field on the pass definition

For inputs from a render target, the following fields may be specified:

- target: namespaced id - the render target id
  - Either a custom target id defined in the same file, orÂ minecraft:mainÂ to reference the main screen target
  - This replaces the formerÂ idÂ field, which was a free-form string
- use_depth_buffer: boolean (default:Â false) - true to sample from the depth texture, false to sample from the color texture
  - This replaces the formerÂ :depthÂ suffix applied to the target id

For inputs from a static texture, the following fields may be specified:

- location: namespaced string - the location to a static texture file that can be sampled by the effect
  - As theÂ idÂ field did before, this resolves to a texture atÂ assets/\<namespace\>/textures/effect/\<path\>.png
- width: positive integer - width in pixels of the texture
- height: positive integer - height in pixels of the texture

#### External Targets

- The 'Fabulous' graphics transparency post-processing config no longer specifies the sorted framebuffers as custom targets
  - These are instead imported in the same way as theÂ minecraft:mainÂ target
  - translucent,Â itemEntity,Â particles,Â weather,Â cloudsÂ are nowÂ minecraft:translucent,Â minecraft:item_entity,Â minecraft:particles,Â minecraft:weather, andÂ minecraft:cloudsÂ respectively
- The entity outline processing shader similarly imports theÂ minecraft:entity_outlineÂ target

### Translation Removals and Renames

- During load some deprecated translation strings will now be removed and/or renamed

## Experimental Features

The following changes only apply when their respective Experiment is turned on, either by activating the corresponding experimental data pack or by turning it on in the Experiments screen while creating the world.

Â 

These experiments have no effect unless enabled. You can find more information about Feature TogglesÂ [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

### Winter Drop

- Added Pale Garden Biome, Pale Oak tree, Pale Moss block, Pale Moss carpet, Pale Hanging Moss and Pale Oak woodset

  - Hanging Sign
  - Slab
  - Stairs
  - Trapdoor
  - Wood
  - Stripped Log
  - Stripped Wood
  - Button
  - Pressure Plate

  - Boat with Chest

#### Pale Moss Block

Pale Moss block generates naturally in the Pale Garden biome

Â 

#### Pale Moss Carpet

Pale Moss block generates naturally in the Pale Garden biome. Unique features:

- When placed, Pale Moss Carpet grows up to two blocks on the solid faces of any block that borders it
- Pale Moss Carpet can be bone mealed to grow to full on all solid faces of any block that borders it

#### Pale Hanging Moss

Pale Hanging Moss generates naturally in the Pale Garden biome under the foliage of Pale Oaks

- Pale Hanging Moss does not grow randomly, but can be bone mealed to grow down

#### Creaking mob

The Creaking mob spawns at night in the Pale Garden biome if there is a Creaking Heart block that has been generated in a Pale Oak tree. Gameplay features:

- Creaking will activate if a surivival or adventure mode player is within 12 blocks of it and looks at it
- Creaking stays active while there is a survival or adventure mode player within 32 blocks of it
- An activated Creaking will not move if a survival or adventure player is looking at it
- Creaking is invulnerable to damage
- Creaking has fire resistance
- When hit by players, a particle trail is shown between the Creaking and the Creaking Heart block it is connected to
- When the Creaking Heart block that the Creaking is connected to is destroyed, the Creaking is removed
- Is not affected by light levels but spawns and despawns based on the day/night cycle
- Creaking cannot enter Boats
- Creaking spawned from a Creaking Heart can not go through portals
- The Creaking Spawn Egg will spawn a Creaking mob that is not connected to a Creaking Heart. This form of Creaking:
  - May also be spawned through commands
  - Will persist through day and night, and loads and saves
  - Is fire-resistant
  - Takes damage from attacks and other damage sources
  - Has one point of health (half a heart)
- A Creaking summoned from the Creaking Heart cannot be spawned with a spawn egg, nor can it be named with a Name Tag or summoned with commands
  - It can only exist as a part of the Creaking Heart block
- Players wearing a Carved Pumpkin on their head can look at Creaking without it freezing in place

#### Creaking Heart

A Creaking Heart is a âlivingâ block generating in Pale Oak trees, covered on all sides by Pale Oak wood logs. It can spawn a Creaking mob when it is nighttime, and it is placed between two correctly aligned Pale Oak Logs.

- Is active during the night and dormant during the day
- Sends a trail of particles towards the connected Creaking when the Creaking gets hit by the player
- When Creaking Heart block is destroyed, the connected Creaking is removed
- Comparators attached to the Creaking Heart block will output a signal strength dependent on the distance to the connected Creaking

#### New system for Pale Garden ambient sounds

Ambient sounds in the Pale Garden biome do not come from the biome settings, but are generated by blocks found in the biome.

- Pale Hanging Moss emits subtle atmospheric sounds when it is attached to Pale Oak Logs and Pale Oak Leaves
- Creaking Heart block emits a set of eerie sounds when it is active during the night and surrounded by Logs on all sides

### Redstone Experiments

Added a new Experiment containing various Redstone-related changes. This can be enabled by selecting "Redstone Experiments" in the Experiments menu when creating a world.

Please note that the experimental features behind this toggle are not aimed at any future release at this time. Instead, this is a place for us to try out changes and gather feedback. We are excited to hear what you think about these changes: please share your feedback on the [feedpack page](https://aka.ms/fbredstone).

#### Redstone Wire

- The performance impact of Redstone wire (connected blocks of Redstone Dust) has been improved
- Redstone wire now only triggers block updates on blocks that may receive power from the wire
- Before a line of wire causes block updates, the new signal strength of all connected wires is set
- The update order around Redstone wire has been changed
  - The aim is to make wire work the same, independent of position and global orientation
  - When possible the order is deterministic based on the context the updates are caused in
  - When there is not enough context to fully determine the order, the rest is picked at random

> **Developer's note:**Â *We know that randomness in Redstone is usually unwanted.*  
> *We've used it here because we've made things deterministic whenever it makes sense, and sometimes it just doesn't make sense - and we don't want some hidden state (like location-based hashes!) determining the order and making machines work differently at different coordinates or in different orientations.*

#### Order in Which a Line of Wire Changes

- When a line of wire turns on, the wires closer to the power source will cause block updates first
- When a line of wire turns off, the wires closer to where the power source was, will cause block updates first
- When two wires have the same distance to the power source, the one to the left in the direction of travel updates first
  - If there is not enough context to know the direction of travel (when the wire was powered from above or below), the side to update first is picked at random

#### Block Updates Around a Wire

- The order in which blocks around the wire update is based on the direction the wire received an update from
- The order of the updates is: back, front, left, right, down, up
- When the updates are further distributed through solid blocks, the same order is applied there

#### Known Issues

As this experiment only changes Redstone wire, interactions with other components may not always act as expected, especially when it comes to update orders.

The removal of excessive neighbor updates around wire affects behavior of Quasi-Connectivity based contraptions. We plan to address these issues at a later point.

### Â 

### Minecart Improvements

Added a new Experiment containing various movement changes to Minecarts. This can be enabled by selecting "Minecart Improvements" in the Experiments menu when creating a world.

Our long term goal is to make vehicle travel, like Minecarts, a viable option for players compared to other late-game options which currently dominate most playstyles. To achieve this, we aim to make riding Minecarts a smooth experience, with consistent and predictable motion and rotation. With this feature toggle we are laying a foundation to build upon in the future. We are aware of that these changes will break some existing contraptions, which is why we want to collaborate with the community to shape the upgrade and future experience of riding Minecarts.

Please note that the experimental features behind this toggle are not aimed at any future release at this time. Instead, this is a place for us to try out changes and gather feedback.

We are excited to hear what you think about these changes: please share your feedback on thisÂ [feedback page](https://aka.ms/fbcarts).

#### Movement Changes

- Minecarts will articulate their movement better when going fast, riding on the rail all the time
  - Minecarts will now smoothly turn along with the track and are less likely to halt or derail
- Minecarts can now jump better
  - They keep their vertical momentum when the track ends with a slope
  - Minecarts will tilt to visually articulate while in the air
  - No rail grinding sound is played when Minecarts are flying through the air
- Added a new accessibility setting that makes players follow the rotation of Minecarts they ride
  - Defaults to off
  - Only has effect when within a world with the experiment enabled
- Added new gameruleÂ minecartMaxSpeedÂ that changes the maximum speed of Minecarts
  - Defaults to 8 and goes up to 1000 blocks per second.
  - Setting it to a specific value does not guarantee that a minecart will reach that particular max speed - there are built in air resistances and similar effects that the speed added through slopes or powered rails need to overcome
  - This gamerule only exists in worlds with the experiment enabled

#### Minecart Changes

- Minecarts can no longer be placed within another Minecart by the player
  - Dispensers can still "stack" Minecarts by placing them on the Rail, even if there is another Minecart already there
- Minecarts can now consistently be placed next to each other along a track
- Minecarts now pick up mobs more consistently when moving along a track
- Minecarts will no longer phase through blocks on slopes

#### Known Impact

- We are aware that these changes will affect certain contraptions such as 'piston bolts', which may now not work at all, or have their behavior changed
- Very delicate rail networks will have their timings changed due to slight changes in speeds, movement distance, friction etc.
- Contraptions that rely on Minecarts snapping to rails will no longer work, or have their behavior changed
