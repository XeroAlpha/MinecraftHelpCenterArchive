**Posted:** November 29, 2022

A new update has been released for Minecraft, bringing Spectator Mode fully into the game! For players using touch controls, you’ll find some new control schemes to make gameplay on your device much better. A new cast of default character skins have been added and the Vex have received a makeover. There’s a lot to explore so dive into the full changelog below.

As always, we appreciate all your help and input! Please report any new bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/) and let your feedback be heard at [feedback.minecraft.net](http://feedback.minecraft.net/).

**New Features:**

**Spectator Mode**

Spectator Mode has made its way into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition! This feature has been experimental for a little while but has now made its way into the game with no experimental toggle required. Here’s a quick write up of this new game mode and how it can be used:

- When cheats are enabled, players can go in and out of Spectator Mode using the Personal Game Mode option in World Settings or the '/gamemode spectator' command
- Spectators have a reduced HUD that does not show the crosshair, hotbar, XP, health, hunger, or armor
- Players’ inventory, health, held items, etc, are unchanged when switching in and out of Spectator Mode
- Spectators are always flying and cannot be grounded
- Spectators pass through solid blocks and entities without collision
- Spectators can see out of solid objects when inside blocks
- Spectators cannot take damage and are not affected by any blocks, mobs, items, portals, or effects
- Spectators cannot use items or interact with blocks or mobs
- Spectators cannot open their inventory or interact with block screens, like Chests or Furnaces
- Spectators cannot be seen by mobs or other players, except other players in Spectator Mode
  - Spectators appear as a transparent floating head to other players in Spectator Mode
- Spectators are not needed to sleep to pass the night
- When playing in first person perspective, spectators do not see their arm or held item
- Spectators generate chunks, if they fly to new chunks
- Spectators do not spawn any mobs
- Non-persistent mobs around spectators will check for distance to any non-spectators when deciding if they should despawn
- Commands can select and act on spectators

A list of fixes since the last release can be found below in the Vanilla Parity section below.

**New Touch Controls**

- New touch controls are now enabled on touch devices by default

**General**

- Actor (Entity) Properties are no longer experimental (This includes Molang queries and property filters, but not Permutations)
- Fixed a crash that would occur if the *texture_index* of a spawn egg was out of bounds. Now a content log error will be presented instead

- Blocks using the "minecraft:placement_filter" component now produce particles, sounds and vibrations events when they are removed due to their placement condition failing

**Mobs**

- "input_ground_controlled" no longer implies increased auto step when controlled by player. The "variable_max_auto_step" component can be used instead. To have consistency with previous versions, use "base_value": 1.0625 and "jump_prevented_value": 0.5625

**Networking**

- Added server property 'enable-lan-visibility' to disable the explicit LAN discovery by clients. This will prevent unexpected port conflicts when running multiple dedicated servers on a single host.

**AI Goals**

- Exposed new data parameters for the "minecraft:offer_flower" AI behaviour to specify such things as the time that the mob offers the flower for, the chance that the goal will start, and the dimensions of the AABB used to search for a mob to offer a flower to
- The "minecraft:offer_flower" AI behavior can now be used by any mob, not just the Iron Golem
- The "minecraft:offer_flower" AI behavior will now search through all mobs in the specified range rather than just the closest one, meaning that this goal has the potential to be used more consistently than before
- Exposed new data parameters for the "minecraft:take_flower" AI behavior to specify such things as the conditions to be met to start the goal, the min and max wait times before taking the flower, and the dimensions of the AABB used to search for a mob to take a flower from
- The "minecraft:take_flower" AI behavior can now be used by any mob, not just baby Villagers

**Molang**

- Fixed *has_property* to return 1 when a property exists and 0 when not, rather than the opposite of that
