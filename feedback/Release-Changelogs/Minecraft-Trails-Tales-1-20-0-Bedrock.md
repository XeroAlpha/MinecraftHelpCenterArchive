    -   This can be done by interacting with the Sign
    -   Signs with non-text chat components can not be edited
-   Both sides of the Sign can now have separate text and colors, allowing for further customization options
    -   By default, a Sign will prompt you to input the front side\'s text when placed

-   Signs can now also be waxed with Honeycomb, preventing any further edits to its text
-   It is no longer possible to use Ink Sac, Glow Ink Sac, or Dyes if the Sign text is empty ([MCPE-133778](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-133778))

**Sniffer**

-   The Sniffer is the mob vote winner of Minecraft Live 2022
-   Sniffers are passive, friendly mobs
-   Sniffers sniff the air and occasionally dig for seeds, which produces a Torchflower Seed or a Pitcher Pod item
-   Sniffers can only dig grass and dirt-like blocks
-   Sniffers can be tempted by, and bred with Torchflower Seeds

**Sniffer Egg**

-   Can be found by brushing the Suspicious Sand of Warm Ocean Ruins
-   When two Sniffers breed they do not immediately spawn a Snifflet; instead, a Sniffer Egg is dropped
-   When placed in the world, the Sniffer Egg will hatch after some time
    -   When placed on Moss, the Egg will hatch in approximately 10 minutes
    -   On all other blocks, it will hatch in approximately 20 minutes

**Torchflowers**

-   The Sniffer can occasionally sniff up a Torchflowers seed, and it can be used to breed two Sniffers
-   The Torchflower seed can be planted on Farmland and grows into a Torchflower
-   The full-grown flower can be harvested and replanted
-   The Torchflower can be crafted into Orange Dye

**Pitcher Plant**

-   The Sniffer can occasionally sniff up a Pitcher Pod item
-   The Pitcher Pod, when planted on Farmland, grows into a Pitcher Crop
-   The Pitcher Crop has five growth stages
-   Once fully grown, the Pitcher Crop can be harvested, yielding a two-block-tall Pitcher Plant
-   The Pitcher Plant can be crafted into Cyan Dye

**Smithing**

-   Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
-   Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Template
-   Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to a piece of equipment
    -   It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
    -   There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
-   Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
-   You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 smithing template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template

**Armor Trims**

-   You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
-   Armor trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits
-   Armor trims can be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings and Boots
    -   All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor\'s item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
    -   To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
-   Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Templates:
    -   Trail Ruins: Wayfinder, Raiser, Shaper, and Host Armor Trims
    -   Pillager Outpost: Sentry Armor Trim
    -   Desert Pyramid: Dune Armor Trim
    -   Shipwreck: Coast Armor Trim
    -   Jungle Temple: Wild Armor Trim
    -   Ocean Monument: Tide Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City: Ward and Silence Armor Trims
    -   Woodland Mansion: Vex Armor Trim
    -   Nether Fortress: Rib Armor Trim
    -   Bastion Remnant: Snout Armor Trim
    -   Stronghold: Eye Armor Trim
    -   End City: Spire Armor Trim
-   Smithing Templates are found in chests in their respective structure
    -   Trail Ruins have no chests, Smithing Templates are instead found by brushing Suspicious Gravel
    -   The Ocean Monument has no chests, Elder Guardians sometimes instead drop a Smithing Template upon death
-   Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
-   An armor trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
    -   The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
    -   The material is defined by which ingredient you used to apply the trim, and controls the color of the trim
-   The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your armor trim are the following:
    -   Iron, Copper, Gold, Lapis, Emerald, Diamond, Netherite, Redstone, Amethyst, Quartz

**Netherite Equipment**

-   Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
-   Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests
    -   Every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant will contain 2 Smithing Templates
-   This change was made for a variety of reasons:
    -   Increase the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
    -   Make Netherite equipment more significant achievement in the game\'s progression
    -   Adapt Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

**Camel**

-   Camels can be equipped with a Saddle and ridden by two players
-   Camels spawn naturally when Desert Villages generate
-   Camels can be tempted by holding Cactus
-   Feed Cactus to Camels to breed them
-   Camels are tall
    -   Most hostile mobs will not be able to reach you when you are on a Camel
    -   They can walk over Fences and Walls
-   Camels randomly sit down
    -   While sitting, it is difficult to convince them to move
-   Camels can either walk slowly or sprint quickly
-   They can also dash forward but will lose stamina for a while when doing so

**Chiseled Bookshelf**

-   A new, chiseled variation of the Bookshelf
-   Crafted with 6 Planks and 3 Wooden Slabs
-   Can store Books, Book and Quills, and Enchanted Books
    -   Holds up to 6 Books
    -   Keeps the stories and lore of your world safe
    -   Books can be removed and added to specific slots on the Chiseled Bookshelf
-   Comparators can detect the last book placed/removed
    -   Perfect for hiding secrets in your spooky library

-   A top Vanilla Parity feature request! A Shield can now be combined with a Banner to apply its pattern on it
    -   The banner is consumed on use
    -   A Shield can be combined with a Banner only if no pattern was previously applied

**New Music**

-   Added the following new music tracks by Aaron Cherof to Cherry Groves, Desert, Jungle, Mesa, and Flower Forest biomes:
    -   A Familiar Room
    -   Bromeliad
    -   Crescent Dunes
    -   Echo in the Wind
-   Added a new music disc which can be acquired by brushing suspicious blocks in Trail Ruins. When put in a Jukebox, Relic by Aaron Cherof is played

**Calibrated Sculk Sensors**

-   A new variant of Sculk Sensors which allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level
-   They are not found naturally and can only be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table
-   One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a redstone signal as input
    -   The strength of that redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to
-   They have a combined active and cooldown phase that lasts 20 game ticks
    -   They output their redstone signal for the first 10 game ticks
-   They can detect vibrations up to 16 blocks away

**Sculk Sensor Phases**

-   Sculk Sensors and Calibrated Sculk Sensors now have three phases: Inactive, Active, and Cooldown
-   The default phase is Inactive
    -   This phase lasts indefinitely until the block receives a vibration
    -   During this phase, the block is able to listen to nearby vibrations until one has been scheduled
-   When a scheduled vibration is received, the block switches to the Active phase
    -   This phase lasts 30 game ticks for Sculk Sensors, and 10 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
    -   During this phase, the block stops listening to nearby vibrations, wiggles its tendrils, and emits a Redstone signal and light
-   After the Active phase has finished, the block switches to a Cooldown phase
    -   This phase lasts for 10 game ticks
    -   During this phase, the block keeps wiggling its tendrils, but no longer emits a Redstone signal nor light
    -   Finally, once this phase is finished, the block will switch back to the Inactive phase
-   Previously, these phases had different timings:
    -   The Active phase lasted 40 game ticks for Sculk Sensors and 20 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
    -   There was no Cooldown phase
-   These phase timings were tweaked so that it is less common for activated contraptions to recursively activate the Sculk Sensor that powered them

**Vibration Resonance**

-   Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors
    -   If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location
-   This behaviour is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally

**Vibration Frequencies**

-   With the addition of Calibrated Sculk Sensors, vibration frequencies have been greatly simplified to prevent unwanted interference
-   The following are category descriptions for each frequency and the expected events that they correspond to:
    -   Movement in any medium (land, liquid or air)
    -   Landing on any surface (land or liquid)
    -   Item interactions
    -   Gliding with an Elytra or unique mob actions (Ravager roaring, Wolf shaking, etc.)
    -   Equipping gear
    -   Interacting with a mob
    -   Mobs and players getting damaged
    -   Consuming items (drinking and eating)
    -   Blocks \'deactivating\' (Door closing, Chest closing, Button unpressing, etc.)
    -   Blocks \'activating\' (Door opening, Chest opening, Button being pressed, etc.)
    -   Blocks changing (Cauldron water level rising, adding food to a Campfire, etc.)
    -   Blocks being destroyed
    -   Blocks being placed
    -   Mobs and players spawning
    -   Mobs and players dying or an explosion

**Playable Mob Sounds**

-   When placing a Mob Head on a Note Block, that Note Block will now play one of the ambient sounds of that mob when played by a player or powered by Redstone
-   Mob Heads can be placed on top of Note Blocks without sneaking

**Piglin Mob Head**

-   Piglins will now drop their heads when killed by a charged Creeper
-   Placing the Piglin head on a Note Block will play one of the Piglin\'s ambient sounds
-   The Piglin head will flap its ears when powered by Redstone, or when worn by a player while walking

**New Achievements**

-   Smithing with Style - Apply these smithing templates at least once: Spire, Snout, Rib, Ward, Silence, Vex, Tide, Wayfinder
-   Planting the Past - Plant any Sniffer seed
-   Careful Restoration - Make a Decorated Pot out of 4 Pottery Sherds\

**Known Issues**

-   Boats that have been placed before today\'s update may not function correctly until they have been broken and placed again, and any mobs inside boats may be ejected when loading your world for the first time. We hope to have this issue resolved soon, but you may wish to keep a backup copy of your world just in case - thanks for your patience!\

**Items**

-   Items with the *'minecraft:throwable'* component now trigger the 'throw' sound effect when used

**Add-Ons**

-   Added *PlacementDirection* and *PlacementPosisition* BlockTraits
    -   The PlacementDirection trait can enable the \"minecraft:cardinal_direction\" and/or \"minecraft:facing_direction\" states on a block.
        -   \"minecraft:cardinal_direction\" is a four value string state \[\"north\", \"south\", \"east\", \"west\"\] that describes what cardinal direction the player was facing when they placed the block.
        -   \"minecraft:facing_direction\" is a six value string state \[\"down\", \"up\", \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", \"west\"\] that describes what direction the player was facing when they placed the block.
        -   Values for these states are set when the block is placed.
    -   The PlacementPosition trait can enable the \"minecraft:block_face\" and/or \"minecraft:vertical_half\" states on a block.
        -   \"minecraft:block_face\" is a six value string state \[\"down\", \"up\", \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", \"west\"\] that describes what face the block was placed on.
        -   \"minecraft:vertical_half\" is a two value string state \[\"bottom\", \"top\"\] that describes whether the block was placed in the upper or lower half of a block position.
        -   Values for these states are set when the block is placed.
    -   Can access all states associated with BlockTraits through the \"block_property\" Molang queries and \"set_block_property\" event responses.
    -   Note: Use of BlockTraits in JSON is currently behind the \"Upcoming Creator Features\" toggle
-   Removed \"knockback_resistance\" item component
-   Pumpkin blocks use the string type state \"minecraft:cardinal_direction\" instead of the int type \"direction\" state
-   Removed \"dye_powder\" item component
-   Items using the minimum duration for the "minecraft:fuel" component now work in the Blast Furnace and Smoker

**Scripting**

-   System Events
    -   Further separation of events into distinct before\* and after\* handling, with some restrictions on the execution of state updates in a before event:
    -   All before events moved from *world.events* into *world.beforeEvents property*. The \"before\" prefix has been removed. Functions that alter world state are prohibited in before event callbacks. Read-only methods and properties are allowed. Set methods are limited to the event object itself. Any use of restricted methods and properties will throw an exception.
    -   For example, *system.events.beforeWatchdogTerminate* is now considered a \"before\" event. Functions that alter world state are prohibited in before event callbacks. Read-only methods and properties are allowed. Set methods are limited to the event object itself. Any use of restricted methods and properties will throw an exception
    -   For example, *system.events.scriptEventReceived* is now considered an \"after\" event. After event callbacks are executed in a deferred manner. Using */scriptEvent* something will queue script to execute at a later point

This means that if you have a reference to an invalid Entity, it will become usable once the Entity has been transferred or reloaded. You can check whether an Entity is loaded or unloaded by reading its *lifetimeState* property
