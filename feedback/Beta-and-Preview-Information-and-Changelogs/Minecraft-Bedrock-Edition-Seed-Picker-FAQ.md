**What\'s a Seed Picker?**** **

The seed picker is a Bedrock Exclusive feature that gives you a selection of seeds that will spawn you in or very near to the biome or feature described.  

You can find the seed picker by going to Minecraft \> Create New \> Create New World \> Game  - then click the box next to the field marked Seed:

**Why is this being updated? **

In the Caves & Cliffs Part II update, the world generation is being changed quite a bit, to make way for the amazing new mountains and caves that will be generating in the world. World generation will also be much closer in parity to the Java Edition, so as you might imagine we\'ve had to reshuffle things around quite a lot! This means that we will need to update the seed picker selection so that you will still be able to find biomes and features in newly created worlds.

 

Please feel free to let us know about the awesome seeds you find here: <https://aka.ms/MCSeedPicker>
