Here’s a list of what’s new in this week’s Minecraft Preview and Beta! As always, we really want to hear your thoughts on these fixes and features, so please send your feedback and ideas to [aka.ms/MC120Feedback](http://aka.ms/MC120Feedback) and report any bugs to [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).

**Known Issue in this Preview:** Using the *Try New Design* button in the edit world screen will cause the game to crash. We hope to have this issue resolved as soon as possible, and are tracking the bug at [MCPE-175921](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-175921).

# Experimental Features

## Villager Trade Rebalancing

- Fixed an issue where experimental Librarians never sold the highest level of their common enchantments ([MCPE-174861](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-174861 "https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-174861"))

# Features and Bug Fixes

## Realms

Realms are now available in Preview and Beta! Any player who has an active Realms subscription is eligible to create a free Realm in Preview/Beta. This Preview Realm will be separate from your regular Realm to prevent any issues from impacting your regular Realm. For more information on how Preview Realms work, please see [Realms in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Preview and Beta FAQ](../../help/Create-or-Join-Realms/How-to-Start-a-Minecraft-Preview-Beta-Realm.md).

We are excited for you to try out any new gameplay features released in Preview on your Realm moving forward. (Psst, that includes some cool new Realms features that will be making their way to Preview soon!)

- Removed obsolete references to "Old world" in "How to Play" screen

- Decorated Pots now store up to a single stack of items 
- Hoppers, Hopper Minecarts, and Droppers can now insert and/or extract items from Decorated Pots
- Comparators can now read the number of items in Decorated Pots
- Players can interact with Decorated Pots to insert items into them

- Increased the maximum stack size of identical Decorated Pots to 64

# Technical Updates

### **Editor**

- Added eventing support for *ExtensionContext* API

- - Added new after event *ModeChangeAfterEvent* and signal *ModeChangeAfterEventSignal*

- Fixed a bug where Cube Brush preview wasn't getting cleared when swapping to Crosshair mid-brush painting 

## Add-Ons and Script Engine

- Improved some of the common scripting error messages to provide better context and information

## Animations

- Fixed unreliability around *query.is_alive* on Server

## Blocks

- Blocks with the "minecraft:cardinal_direction", "minecraft:facing_direction", or "minecraft:block_face" states as part of the "minecraft:placement_direction" or "minecraft:placement_position" BlockTraits are rotated/mirrored properly by Structure Blocks
- Structure Void blocks once again prevents interaction with blocks and entities placed behind them ([MCPE-175237](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-175237 "https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-175237"))
- "planks" block is now split into unique instances "oak_planks", "spruce_planks", "birch_planks", "jungle_planks", "acacia_planks", "dark_oak_planks"
- Commands will still work with "planks", however, "planks" block will not be suggested 
- "stone" block is now split into unique instances: "stone", "granite", "polished_granite", "diorite", "polished_diorite", "andesite" and "polished_andesite" 

## Cameras

- Added a content warning for when the camera is placed outside of the player's chunk radius 

## AI Goal Components

- Added "minecraft:behavior.melee_box_attack" behavior which functions the same as "minecraft:behavior.melee_attack" but uses bounds based attack reach calculations

- - The *reach_multiplier* attribute is removed and replaced with *box_increase*
  - Reach is calculated by increasing the bounds of the attacking mobs in the xz-plane by *box_increase* blocks to create an "attack box". If the attack box intersects with the target's bounds the attacking mob can reach it

## API

- Added *BlockComponentTypeMap*, *EntityComponentTypeMap*, and *ItemComponentTypeMap* aliases which map Component IDs to their TypeScript types
- Changed *Block.getComponent*, *Entity.getComponent*, and *ItemStack.getComponent* to return the correct derived Component type
- Added *BlockComponentTypes*, *EntityComponentTypes*, and *ItemComponentTypes* enums that enumerate component ID strings

## Components

- Added "minecraft:can_join_raid" component to allow entities to join existing raids

## Items

- Deprecated the "tag:" legacy item component and released the "minecraft:tags" item component out of experimental in json formats 1.20.50 and higher

## Mobs

- Fixed an issue preventing mobs from spawning further than 6 chunks away from the nearest player even if the server's simulation range is larger than 6 chunks ([MCPE-102197)](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-102197)

## Molang

- Fixed animation controller loading to use the pack's *min_engine_version* rather than the file's *format_version* to determine the Molang Version. This fix applies to animation controllers in packs with a *min_engine_version* of 1.20.50 or higher 

- The following Molang queries are Deprecated and will no longer be available in packs with a *min_engine_version *of 1.20.50 or higher
  - Replaced with *query.timer_flag_1*, set by *behavior.timer_flag_1*

  <!-- -->

  - Replaced with *query.timer_flag_2*, set by *behavior.timer_flag_2*

  <!-- -->

  - Replaced with *query.timer_flag_3*, set by *behavior.timer_flag_3*

  <!-- -->

  - It was only used to adjust the head animation of the camel as it came out of dash cooldown
  - Camel animation uses *variable.dash_cooldown_progress* in camel.entity.json now

- - *query.is_scenting*
  - *query.is_rising*
  - *query.is_feeling_happy*
  - *query.dash_cooldown_progress*

## Stability and Performance

- Removed *CraftingEventPacket*

# Experimental Technical Features

## API

- Added *effectAddBeforeEvent* and removed *effectState* from *effectAddAfterEvent*
