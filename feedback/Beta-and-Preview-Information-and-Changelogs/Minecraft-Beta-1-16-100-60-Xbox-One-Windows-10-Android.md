**PLEASE READ before participating in the Minecraft Beta:**

- Joining the beta will replace your game with a work in progress version of Minecraft
- You will not have access to Realms and will not be able to join non-beta players while you're previewing the beta
- Any worlds played while in the beta cannot be opened in previous versions of the game so please make copies of worlds to prevent losing them
- Beta builds can be unstable and are not representative of final version quality
- The beta is available only on Xbox One, Windows 10, and Android (Google Play). To join or leave the beta, see [aka.ms/JoinMCBeta](https://aka.ms/JoinMCBeta) for detailed instructions

 

**Performance and Stability** 

- Fixed a crash on that could occur when Player 1 in a split-screen session disconnects their controller ([MCPE-99565)](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-99565)

**Gameplay** 

- When the '/clone' command replaces a double chest with another double chest, it now sets their pairing correctly upon load. This way it doesn't cause errors before it ticks to match up the pair

**Graphical** 

- Touchscreen input "Chat and Commands" UI element now has a darker border  
- "Tip" messages no longer appear off screen  
- Added the ability to animate the placement of a structure with the '/structure' command   
- Changed vignette layer from 4 to 5 to prevent drawing vignette in between hotbar items

**Technical Changes** 

- Fixed updating of bounding box to happen after proper scale has been set
