## Technical Updates

### AI Goals

- Made the schema for for the following goals stricter when parsing, they will now fail to load an entity json that has invalid data in versions 1.26.0 and newer
  - minecraft:behavior.delayed_attack
  - minecraft:behavior.dragonstrafeplayer
  - minecraft:behavior.dragonchargeplayer
  - minecraft:behavior.melee_attack
  - minecraft:behavior.melee_box_attack
  - minecraft:behavior.stomp_attack
- Float Range field target_zone in minecraft:behavior.dragonchargeplayer and minecraft:behavior.dragonstrafeplayer now only accepts an object with min and max values. Other formats will fail to parse.
- Added new fields to minecraft:jump.dynamic
  - regular_skip_data: Used during normal skip movement
    - distance_scale: The multiplier applied to horizontal velocity when jumping
    - height: The force applied vertically when jumping
    - jump delay: Amount of ticks between sequential jumps
    - animation_duration: Duration of the jump animation
  - fast_skip_data: Used when travelling quickly with skip movement
    - distance_scale: The multiplier applied to horizontal velocity when jumping
    - height: The force applied vertically when jumping
    - jump delay: Amount of ticks between sequential jumps
    - animation_duration: Duration of the jump animation

### API

- Fixed a issue where getComponents on Entity could return an undefined in the array, when used in older scripting versions.

### Blocks

- Added block permutation component validation for geometry and material instance components. If you add one, you need to add the other.
  - Raises a warning for blocks with a format_version from before 1.26.0
  - Raises an error for blocks with a format_version of 1.26.0 and after
- The Block Trait minecraft:connection can now be used without the Upcoming Creator Features toggle
- minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction in minecraft:placement_direction can now be used without the Beta APIs toggle
- Updated documentation for the "use_liquid_clipping" field in "minecraft:liquid_detection" to better explain its use.
- Updated minecraft:geometry block component to fix ([MCPE-231979](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-231979))
  - Changed minecraft:geometry.full_block so **DOWN** face is rotated 180 degrees, this brings it in parity with non data driven full blocks and Java full blocks.
  - Creators can still use the old geometry by explicitly using the identifier minecraft:geometry.full_block_v1.
  - Any existing blocks using minecraft:geometry.full_block that have a format_version less than **1.26.0** will look the same and internally be considered as minecraft:geometry.full_block_v1.
- Released minecraft:collision_box improvements from experimental and removed requirement of format version 1.21.130 or higher for those improvements.
  - Can now have an array of collision boxes
  - Max height has been increased from 16 to 24
- Game no longer crashes on initializing minecraft:collision_box component when the server sends invalid packets

### Camera

- Provided the script API for supporting entity type families in the aim assist

### Components

- Updated the various "minecraft.behaviour.look_at_X" behavior components
  - Made schemas stricter when parsing and will fail to load an entity json that has invalid data in versions 1.26.0 and newer
    - "min_look_time" and "max_look_time" - deprecated and has been replaced properly with "look_time"
      - Uses of "min_look_time" and "max_look_time" will get upgraded automatically
    - "look_time" - takes "min" and "max" as a range
  - These changes affect the following behavior components:
    - "minecraft.behaviour.look_at_entity"
    - "minecraft.behaviour.look_at_player"
    - "minecraft.behaviour.look_at_target"
    - "minecraft.behaviour.look_at_trading_player"
  - Previous usage of the following definitions will not be automatically upgraded to preserve old behavior
    - "look_time" - this was not correctly parsed prior to version 1.26.0, and always resulted in default values being assigned to "min_look_time" and "max_look_time"
    - "target_distance" - was used in some definitions and it was never passed to the component
      - This would just silently fail and assign default values to the component

### Editor

- Added getDefaultProperties, popPropertiesById, pushPropertiesById and updatePropertiesById functions to Cursor API to manage stateful properties
- Added dimensionId and ignoreEditorModeVisibilityOverride to the Widget API to control widget visibility without manual handling
- Added a drawerPane API property to IRootPropertyPane for displaying a split-view drawer overlaid on the root pane's contents
- Added a style API property to IPropertyItemOptionsBase for overriding default styles of items
- Added 3-point selection mode enabled by default (shift-click to make a 3D volume selection), added '2-Point Selection' toggle to disable
- Updated IListPanePropertyItem to dynamically adjust its size based on the number of entries until the maximum height is reached, unless the optional fixedHeight property is set
- Updated LayoutAlignment API enum values to be Start and End, instead of Left and Right
- Updated LayoutDirection API with PaneLayoutType, and Horizontal property will now be treated as a single row
- Updated Grapple tool so it will work within the full view distance
- Fixed a bug that caused Navigation panel selected location to not mark the list entry
- Fixed a bug that caused the input field focus highlight to remain after a drag operation

### Entity

- All projectiles now deflect "reflect_on_hurt:true" projectiles on hit as outlined in the documentation ([MCPE-232731](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-232731))
  - This is in addition to damage causing these projectiles to be deflected

### Entity Components

- Fixed an issue where 'on_equip' and 'on_unequip' events on the 'minecraft:equippable' entity component would be executed on world load
  - The 'on_equip' and 'on_unequip' events now only execute as a result of an interaction in the game world
- Split the minecraft:breedable component into two:
  - minecraft:offspring_data which defines how an offspring of an entity is born, it contains the following fields moved from minecraft:breedable
    - blend_attributes
    - inherit_tamed
    - mutation_factor
    - mutation_strategy
    - random_variant_mutation_interval
    - random_extra_variant_mutation_interval
    - deny_parents_variant
    - breeds_with
    - combine_parent_colors
    - property_inheritance
    - parent_centric_attribute_blending
  - minecraft:breedable now only contains data about how an entity uses breeding behavior
    - Such as how it enters the "love" state such as the items it requires, if it must be tamed, or at full health
    - How it handles the pregnancy system and fires those events
    - The way it spawns the child entity is via the minecraft:offspring_data component which an entity must have

### General

- Fixed issue where marketplace content did not load correctly on PlayStation
- Added new Biome tags
  - "slime" tag allows Slime to spawn higher than usual
  - "swamp_water_huge_mushroom" tag allows huge mushrooms to spawn in shallow swamp water
  - "fast_fishing" tag increases Fishing speed
  - "high_seas" tag alters Salmon behavior
  - "surface_mineshaft" tag changes Surface Mineshaft blocks to Dark Oak
- Changed so that it is possible to reuse a keybinding for normal actions, macros, and chords

### Network Protocol

- ActorType modified: added ActorType::Undead
- ActorType modified: renamed ActorType::UndeadMob to ActorType::UndeadMonster
- ActorCategory modified: renamed ActorCategory::UndeadMob to ActorCategory::UndeadMonster
- Added new Level Sound Event "saddle_in_water"
  - Levelsoundevent modified: added unique sound events for every spear type

### Sounds

- Every spear type now has its own unique sound event, allowing creators to define dedicated custom sounds

### Stability and Performance

- Fixed a crash that could sometimes occur if the game is closed when the "Syncing user data" screen is showing

### User Interface

- Updated the priority of stack_panel children to be bindable

### UI Scaling

- Consolidated JSON UI and Ore UI under one scaling approach
- Ore UI screens use full-integer scaling for sharper visuals
- Revised scaling range: new defaults, new min/max
- Default scale uses DPI-based detection on handheld devices
- Minimum scale set to half the maximum scale value

## Experimental Technical Updates

### API

- Added attachedTo property to DebugShape which specifies an Entity that this shape should be positionally attached to.
- Added visibleTo property to DebugShape which specifies an (optional) array of players that this shape should be visible to.
- Debug Shapes no longer have a maximum render distance.

### Graphical

- RenderDragon for Creators Experiment
  - Static colored lighting has been adjusted to dim block light color relative to the max block light emission level, similar to standard, non-colored lighting ([MCPE-231639](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-231639))
  - Static colored lighting on flowing lava and other blocks no longer appears too dark
  - Fixed cases of static colored lighting leaking through corners
  - Added static lighting shading support to data driven entities and items
  - The number of analytic/point lights in the scene is now limited according to resource availability
  - Analytic/point lights will now phase in or out according to their importance to the scene's lighting
