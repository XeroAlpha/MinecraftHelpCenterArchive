  - The new cubemap configuration files should be placed in the *cubemaps* directory of a resource pack.
  - Example of a cubemap configuration file with path cubemaps/mycubemap.json:

  ``` auto
      {
          "format_version": "1.21.130",
          "minecraft:cubemap_settings": {
              "description": {
                  "identifier": "mypack:mycubemap"
              },
              "lighting": {
                  "ambient_light_illuminance": {
                      "0.00000": 4.0,
                      "1.000000": 4.0
                  },
                  "sky_light_contribution": 1.0,
                  "directional_light_contribution": 1.0,
                  "affected_by_atmospheric_scattering": true,
                  "affected_by_volumetric_scattering": true
              }
          }
      }
  ```

  - *format_version*: Required field containing "1.21.130"
  - *minecraft:cubemap_settings*: Required field
  - *minecraft:cubemap_settings/description/identifier*: Required field. If the identifier is equal to *minecraft:default_cubemap*, it will be used by default in all biomes. Otherwise, the cubemap configuration can be applied to a biome by supplying the same identifier in the respective *.client_biome.json* file for that biome. Example of a biome configuration file with path biomes/river.client_biome.json:

  ``` auto
      {
        "format_version": "1.21.130",
        "minecraft:client_biome": {
          "description": {
            "identifier": "minecraft:river"
          },
          "components": {
            "minecraft:cubemap_identifier": {
              "cubemap_identifier": "mypack:mycubemap"
            }
          }
        }
      }
  ```

  - *minecraft:cubemap_settings/lighting*: Required field. Any fields inside *lighting* are optional
  - *minecraft:cubemap_settings/lighting/ambient_light_illuminance*: Contains pairs of numbers, where the first number should be between 0.0 and 1.0 (time of day) and the second number should be between 0.0 and 100000.0 (ambient light). Default value is 5.625 for all times of day
  - *minecraft:cubemap_settings/lighting/sky_light_contribution*: Contribution of the sky light. It should be between 0.0 and 1.0. Default value is 1.0
  - *minecraft:cubemap_settings/lighting/directional_light_contribution*: Contribution of the directional light. It should be between 0.0 and 1.0. Default value is 0.0
  - *minecraft:cubemap_settings/lighting/affected_by_atmospheric_scattering*: Value is a boolean and controls the state of the atmospheric scattering effect applied the cubemap. Default value is false
  - *minecraft:cubemap_settings/lighting/affected_by_volumetric_scattering*: Value is a boolean and controls the state of the volumetric scattering effect applied the cubemap. Default value is true

### Item Components

- Added the minecraft:swing_sounds item component
  - Allows overriding the swing sounds emitted by the user
  - Fields:
    - "attack_miss": sound played when an attack misses or deals no damage due to invulnerability
    - "attack_hit": sound played when an attack hits
    - "attack_critical_hit": sound played when an attack hits and deals critical damage
  - At least one field needs to be specified
- Added the minecraft:kinetic_weapon item component
  - Description:
    - Allows an item to deal damage and other effects every tick while in use, to all unobstructed targets found in a straight line from the user's view vector
    - Damage is computed based on both the user's and target's velocity projected onto the view vector (via dot product)
    - The more the user and target move toward each other and align with the view vector, the higher the damage
    - After applying "damage_multiplier" and "damage_modifier", the resulting damage is floored to the nearest lower integer
  - Fields:
    - "delay": Ticks to wait before applying damage and effects
    - "reach": Range along the view vector where entities can be hit
    - "hitbox_size": Extra tolerance on the raycast to detect entities
    - "damage_multiplier": Multiplies the sum of the projected velocities
    - "damage_modifier": Adds to the multiplied sum of the projected velocities
    - "damage_conditions": Conditions that need to be satisfied for damage to be applied
    - "knockback_conditions": Conditions that need to be satisfied for knockback to be applied
    - "dismount_conditions": Conditions that need to be satisfied for riders to be dismounted
  - "damage_conditions", "knockback_conditions" and "dismount_conditions" fields:
    - "max_duration": Time, in ticks, during which the effect can be applied after "delay" elapses
    - "min_speed": Minimum user's speed (projected onto the view vector via a dot product) required for the effect to be applied
    - "min_relative_speed": Minimum relative speed of the user with respect to the target (projected onto the view vector via a dot product) required for the effect to be applied
    - If omitted, the corresponding effect does not apply
  - Requirements:
    - Requires the "minecraft:use_modifiers" item component on the same item
- Added the "minecraft:piercing_weapon" item component
  - Description:
    - Allows an item to deal damage to all entities detected in a straight line along the user's view vector
    - Items with this component cannot destroy blocks, as the attack action always takes priority, regardless of what the user is looking at
  - Fields:
    - "reach": Range along the view vector where entities can be hit
    - "hitbox_size": Extra tolerance on the raycast to detect entities
  - Requirements:
- The "minecraft:cooldown" item component now supports a "type" field
  - Defines the action the cooldown applies to, in a mutually exclusive way, so cooldowns for one action type do not affect the other
  - Values:
    - "use": puts the item on cooldown when used, preventing further use until it expires, but still allowing attacks, mining, and interaction
    - "attack": puts the item on cooldown when attacking, preventing further attacks until it expires, but still allowing use, mining, and interaction
  - "use" is the default value, preserving the component's original behavior

### Molang

- Added four new Molang queries pertaining to the minecraft:on_use_kinetic_damage item component:
  - query.get_kinetic_item_delay, Returns the delay value from the main-hand item's minecraft:on_use_kinetic_damage component, or 0 if the component is not present
  - query.get_kinetic_item_damage_duration, Returns the damage_duration value from the main-hand item's minecraft:on_use_kinetic_damage component, or 0 if the component is not present
  - query.get_kinetic_item_knockback_duration, Returns the knockback_duration value from the main-hand item's minecraft:on_use_kinetic_damage component, or 0 if the component is not present
  - query.get_kinetic_item_dismount_duration, Returns the dismount_duration value from the main-hand item's minecraft:on_use_kinetic_damage component, or 0 if the component is not present
- Added "query.kinetic_weapon_delay", which returns the "delay" value from the main-hand item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component, or 0 if the component is not present
- Added "query.kinetic_weapon_damage_duration", which returns the "max_duration" value of "damage_conditions" from the main-hand item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component, or 0 if the component is not present
- Added "query.kinetic_weapon_knockback_duration", which returns the "max_duration" value of "knockback_conditions" from the main-hand item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component, or 0 if the component is not present
- Added "query.kinetic_weapon_dismount_duration", which returns the "max_duration" value of "dismount_conditions" from the main-hand item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component, or 0 if the component is not present
- Added "query.ticks_since_last_kinetic_weapon_hit", which returns the number of ticks elapsed since the user last hit something while using a kinetic weapon
  - Returns -1.0 if no kinetic weapon is being used or if nothing has been hit yet
  - Hits that occur while the user is unloaded are not counted

### Network Protocol

- Added ActorFlags::BODY_ROTATION_LOCKED_TO_VEHICLE
- LevelSoundEventPacket modified: added LevelSoundEvent::SpearAttackHit, LevelSoundEvent::SpearAttackMiss, LevelSoundEvent::WoodenSpearAttackHit and LevelSoundEvent::WoodenSpearAttackMiss

### Particles

- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect validation errors for particle texture path ([MCPE-220351](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-220351))

### Structures

- Prevented a crash when trying to export structures in unsupported platforms

## Experimental Technical Updates

### API

- Debug drawing tech in @minecraft/debug-utilities now supports rendering shapes in different dimensions:
  - Added setLocation(location: minecraftserver.DimensionLocation \| minecraftserver.Vector3): void method to DebugShape
  - The location property on DebugShape has been changed to read only (use setLocation above to modify the location)
  - Added dimension readonly property to DebugShape
  - Changed the constructors of all the debug shapes to instead take a variant of Vector3 or DimensionLocation
- Fixed triggering of PlayerSwingStartAfterEvent to only happen on the start of a swing
- Fixed issue where onBreak beta API event would not fire if a Piston was the breaking cause
- Released @minecraft/server version 2.4.0
- Added @minecraft/server version 2.5.0-beta

### API Infra

- Modernized CommandOutputPacket serialization
  - Max number of "Output Messages" set max to 100
    - Field "Message Id", set max size to 512 characters
    - Max number of "Parameters" set to 512
- Modernized CommandRequestPacket serialization
  - Field "Request ID", set max size to 39 characters

### Blocks

- Added component minecraft:support behind the Upcoming Creator Features toggle

Example:

``` auto
"minecraft:support": { 
    "shape": "stair" // "fence" is also valid 
}
```

- Created a new block trait, minecraft:connection, to expose behavior like Fences or Glass Panes from Vanilla where blocks connect to other blocks around them. Using this trait with the example below adds the bool states minecraft:connection_north, minecraft:connection_east, minecraft:connection_south, and minecraft:connection_west. This is only available while the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle is enabled

Example:

``` auto
{
    "format_version": "1.21.130",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "test:connection_block",
            "traits": {
                "minecraft:connection": {
                    "enabled_states": ["minecraft:cardinal_connections"]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- One known issue with this is that blocks using minecraft:connection don't properly decide connections to blocks like Fences, Walls, Iron Bars, Fence Gates, and Glass Panes. Addressing this issue is currently in development
