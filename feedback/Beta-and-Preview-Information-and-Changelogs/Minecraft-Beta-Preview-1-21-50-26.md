It's time for a new Preview and Beta! This week we're amping up the atmosphere in the pale garden. Eyeblossoms will now puff out orange particles when they open – and leaves will fall from the pale oak trees in the pale garden – adding to the ambiance of this new, eerie biome. As always, we’re keen to get your feedback on these new features at [feedback.mojang.net](http://feedback.mojang.net/), and you can report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/)! Here's what's new this week:

# New Features and Bug Fixes

## Biomes

- Music volume now gradually lowers to zero when entering a Pale Garden and gradually resumes when leaving it

### Pale Garden

- Add the Pale Oak Sapling, Eyeblossoms, Pale Moss Block, and Hanging Pale Moss to the Wandering Trader ([MCPE-187456](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187456))

## Blocks

- Adjusted the flammability of Pale Moss, Pale Moss Carpet, and Pale Hanging Moss  
  - They now burn more quickly but take longer to catch on fire
  - They can now be ignited by Lava
- The attenuation drop-off rate for Pale Hanging Moss and Creaking Heart ambient sounds is now linear, allowing them to be heard from greater distances ([MCPE-187326](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187326))
- Eyeblossoms now play sounds when opening and closing
- Open Eyeblossoms now emit ambient sounds when placed on a Pale Moss Block
- Vine, Cave Vines, Twisting Vines, and Weeping Vines now play their correct sounds instead of the Nether Wart sound
- Hanging Pale Moss now has the same model as Java ([MCPE-187397](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187397))
- Eyeblossoms placed in world and in Flower Pots now emit a particle when opening/closing
- Pale Oak Leaves now emit falling leaf particles

### Creaking Heart

- Reduced the distance by which the Creaking Heart can spread Resin Clumps by one block
- Resin Clumps can now only spread onto Pale Oak Log, Stripped Pale Oak Log, Pale Oak Wood, and Stripped Pale Oak Wood

### Resin Bricks

- Recipes for Resin Brick Slabs, Stairs, and Walls now give the same amount of blocks as the Nether Brick ones

> **Developer's Note:** *Counting is hard.*

### Resin Clump

- Mobs now correctly pathfind over Resin Clumps

## Commands

- Translated rawtexts with extra percentage signs in them no longer expand inconsistently for numbered forms ("%%%%1"), compared to non-numbered ones ("%%%%s"). ([MCPE-171001](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171001))
- Effect command now properly displays duration as seconds in the displayed message after adding an effect ([MCPE-186963](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-186963))

## Features

- Standardized the blocks that trees can replace when growing, with a few exceptions ([MCPE-187302](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187302)) ([MCPE-187301](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187301))
  - All trees can now grow through leaves, with the exception of Cherry trees cannot grow through their own leaves
  - All trees can grow on dirt-like blocks
- Tall Grass generates properly with its top part in the Pale Garden biome
- Tall Grass generates properly with its top part in the Lush Caves biome

## Gameplay

- Holding the jump button when falling on a Slime Block no longer cancels the bounce ([MCPE-185354](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185354))
- Sneaking while landing on a Slime Block no longer causes fall damage

> **Developer's Note:** The intended way to stop bouncing on a Slime Block is now to sneak.  
> Previously players could stop bouncing by holding the jump button, but this was an unintentional oversight that worked since the jump effectively cancelled out the movement from the block.
>
> This caused other types of bugs such as when hitting a mob with a Mace with Wind Charge enchantment while holding the jump button.  
> The new player jump behaviour is to always pick the highest between existing vertical velocity and jump velocity.

- Fixed one case where blocks would fail to place if a player would place a block and then change their selected slot before the server handled the block placement. This would reject the block placement because the server didn't expect the slot to change ([MCPE-112420](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-112420))

## Graphics

- Sky color now gradually transitions when traveling between different biomes, rather than changing abruptly ([MCPE-90625](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-90625))

## Items

- Resin Clump and Resin Brick items no longer float in the Player's hand in 3rd person view
- Open and Closed Eyeblossoms can now be used on Mooshrooms to obtain their respective Suspicious Stews when milking
- Blackstone can now be used to repair stone tools and stone weapons ([MCPE-71859](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-71859))

## Mobs

### Creaking

- Reduced the speed of non-hostile Creakings
- Tamed Wolves' attacks no longer prevent Creakings from attacking the Player
- Creakings can no longer move when only their feet are observed, and their feet are in Soul Sand or Mud
- Creakings can now approach a Player which is looking downward, stopping only once they enter the Player's field of view
- The Creaking now sways when hit by a projectile
- The Creaking's attack animation has been smoothed out for a more natural motion
- The volume and pitch of the Creaking's step sounds have been adjusted
- The attenuation drop-off rate for some of the Creaking's sounds is now linear, allowing them to be heard from greater distances

## Realms

- Fixed bug where loading screens while loading a realm were not showing Realms UI elements

## Stability and Performance

- Improved game loading stability

## Structures

- Cherry Leaves no longer count as custom blocks ([MCPE-180725](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180725))

## Audio
