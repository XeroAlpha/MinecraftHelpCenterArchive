![The new copper and tuff blocks in the Minecraft Preview. There are some redstone builds in the scene, and a bat in the foreground sporting a new look](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/20699846496141)

It’s October in Sweden, and the leaves outside are changing from green to orange faster than copper can oxidize! I could spend this whole changelog waxing lyrical about the new decorative blocks coming to experimental testing this week, but instead how about I tell you to look out for the copper trapdoor, copper door, copper grate, and chiseled copper block! All of these can be waxed, chiseled, and scraped to your heart’s content, so you can color co-ordinate with pumpkins *or* creepers. Also coming to testing is a new set of tuff blocks (finally, tuff stairs!) and, a new bat texture! As ever, we’d love your feedback on these new features. Send us your thoughts [here](https://aka.ms/Minecraft121Feedback) and report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/)!

*(**Please note:** Thanks for your patience! This Preview and Beta has now started rolling out.)

- When placed, its light is off by default
  - While the Copper Bulb is unpowered, it will toggle its light on or off when it receives a Redstone pulse
  - Copper Bulb light will stay on even when the Redstone source is removed until it receives another Redstone pulse to toggle it off

# Features and Bug Fixes

- Known issue in this update: Creative Flight speed is greatly reduced after touching the ground

## Bat

- The Bat now has a new look, thanks to an updated model, animations, and texture

## Blocks

- A Sticky Piston pulling a retracting Sticky Piston that is pulling a player and another block no longer crashes the game ([MCPE-175790](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-175790))
- Chorus Flowers can now be destroyed by any projectile, which will no longer disappear after impact 

## Decorated Pots

- The sounds emitted by Decorated Pots breaking have been made "smashier" 

## Gameplay

- Fixed an issue where players couldn't block with a shield after releasing to use an item that had left their inventory ([MCPE-171346](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171346)) 

## Mobs

- Leads will no longer break if a leashed mob is not in the same chunk as the leash holder upon reloading a world ([MCPE-157182](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-157182))
- Mobs on fire no longer spread fire to their target when holding something in their main hand 
- The calculations to determine whether a mob can attack a player or other mobs have been changed. Previously a mob's horizontal width was used to determine their attack reach and their height had no effect. The area where a mob can attack is now their bounding box extended in horizontal directions. 
  - The mobs affected by this change are Axolotl, Bee, Blaze, Cave Spider, Dolphin, Drowned, Enderman, Endermite, Fox, Hoglin, Husk, Iron Golem, Panda, Piglin, Piglin Brute, Pillager, Silverfish, Skeleton, Spider, Stray, Vindicator, Warden, Wither Skeleton, Wolf, Zoglin, Zombie, Zombie Pigman, and Zombie Villager
  - The new reach calculation is the attacking mob's bounding box extended by 0.8 blocks horizontally. If this extended box overlaps the target's bounding box, then the attack can reach
  - This change does not affect the reach of players

## Touch Controls

- Fixed an issue where the player could enter touch control customization without having touch controls ([MCPE-175530](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-175530))
