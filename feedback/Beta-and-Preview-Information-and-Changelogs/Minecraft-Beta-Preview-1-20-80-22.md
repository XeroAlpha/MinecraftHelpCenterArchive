**Posted:** March 14, 2024

**Information on Minecraft Preview and Beta:**

- These work-in-progress versions can be unstable and may not be representative of final version quality
- Minecraft Preview is available on Xbox, PlayStation 4, Windows 10/11, and iOS devices. More information can be found at [aka.ms/PreviewFAQ](https://aka.ms/PreviewFAQ)
- The beta is available on Android (Google Play). To join or leave the beta, see [aka.ms/JoinMCBeta](https://aka.ms/JoinMCBeta) for detailed instructions

The mace is smashing its way into your worlds! Use its smash attack while falling and time it just right to knock back your enemies – the longer you fall, the stronger the blow! Craft this new weapon by combining a breeze rod with the heavy core, a new item you can find by unlocking trial chamber vaults.

![Action_house_zombie.png](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/24981775975949)

Alongside the mace this week there are also new pottery sherds to collect, new armor trims to covet, and new banner designs to decorate your base with! Show the world (and your server) that you’ve bested the trial chambers with the flow or bolt armor trims. Declare yourself a breeze fan with two new banner designs, or bring a piece of the trial chambers home with new pottery sherd designs – all in testing now!

Your continued feedback is really helping shape the 1.21 update! Please let us know what you think at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net/) and report any bugs you find on [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/).  
  

**Experimental Features:**

**Mace**

- A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
- Leverage the weight of this new weapon to deal additional damage the farther you fall before hitting your target
  - Try it out by jumping down toward your target, and hit them before you hit the ground
  - Successfully striking a target in this way will negate any damage accumulated from the fall, similar to how a Wind Charge works
  - Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
- Using a Mace will decrease its durability like any other weapon; repair it with Breeze Rods at an Anvil
- Players can use a Mace in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks on their enemies
- We'd love to hear your feedback on the Mace at [aka.ms/mcmacefeedback](https://aka.ms/mcmacefeedback)

**Technical Updates:**

## **Commands**

## **Mobs**

- Added spawn categories to Bedrock. They will be used in the future for mob spawning. Spawn categories have been enabled in entity behavior pack files, but are not yet functional

**Experimental Technical Updates:**

## **Graphical**

- Improved texture filtering for renderchunks to smooth the transition between LODs
- Added a new feature to the Deferred Technical Preview: **Sky Reflections**. This new effect will reflect the sky on surfaces depending on their roughness and other surface properties. See the updated [Getting Started with Deferred Lighting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/deferredlighting?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable) article on the Learning Portal for more information. Note that since these are reflections of the sky, reflections will not be visible when in caves, indoors or the Nether. Reflections for these scenarios and of other objects such as the terrain and entities will be added in future updates.

## **Editor**

The Editor and its corresponding API are in early development, and available for keyboard/mouse on Windows PC Bedrock Preview builds. Tag us on social channels with **\#BedrockEditor.**

Learn [how to use](https://aka.ms/LearnEditor) the Editor, join the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions) forum to engage with the team, and get started building extensions via the [starter kit](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-starter-kit) and [samples](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-samples).

Improvements this week:

- Added three classes: the IBlockPaletteItem interface and the ProbabilityBlockPaletteItem and SimpleBlockPaletteItem concrete classes. These classes will be used in the later implementation of the Block Palette
- Tool mode screen layout will now be using a fixed drawer system rather than floating window panels. Drawers panels support drag to resize, expand/collapse, and show/hide behaviors

- Changed top level menus to show up only when they contain items
- Added *uniqueId* property to *IMenuCreationParams* API which will replace *IMenu* id on creation
- Added *menubar: IMenuContainer* property *to IPlayerUISession*. *IMenuContainer* will manage menu related operations
