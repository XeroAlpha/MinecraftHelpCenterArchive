## Camera

- Added the view offset to the 3<sup>rd</sup> person camera for the experimental *follow_orbit* preset
  - The view offset is anchored to a pivot point at the center of the screen. When applied to the follow_orbit preset, the player is shifted to be at a distance from center specified by the the offset.
  - The range for this offset is -100 to 100
  - This can be set by both commands and JSON
    - /camera @s set minecraft:follow_orbit view_offset viewX viewY
  - A new learning portal article detailing the 3<sup>rd</sup> person camera, including JSON syntax, will be published soon.
- Added starting radius and rotation to the *follow_orbit* and 3<sup>rd</sup> person boom camera presets
  - The starting radius (distance from player) is fixed right now at 10 blocks from the player position.
  - The starting rotation (pitch and yaw) are fixed right now at 45X and 45Y.
  - The follow orbit camera is the only preset available, the 3<sup>rd</sup> person boom preset will be coming in a future release.
- Exposed radius component to behavior packs to be overwritten by creator cameras. Also added ‘minecraft:third_person’ and ‘minecraft:third_person_front’ to the allow list of presets that can be inherited from
  - This allows you to make a 3<sup>rd</sup> person camera based on the vanilla 3<sup>rd</sup> person cameras but with a variable radius.  
    The radius (distance from player) is not limited but render distance and other constraints still exist.
  - This does ***not*** allow modifications to the vanilla cameras.

## Editor

- Removed Keybinding for ‘D’ from Paste Preview which blocked movement right. Fixed Distance mode can be selected using the side-panel
- Fixed missing CTRL+X key binding in Editor
- Expanded the Block Palette Service API to allow management of Block Palettes and Block Palette Items
- Added radial drag to number input fields, allowing value changes with mouse drag movement
- Introduced a new script brush manager method *getBrushVolume* which, given a set of brush pipeline operations, builds an absolute compound block volume for the brush
- Fixed bug where small movements in the brush tool caused incorrect cursor tracking

## Entity Components

- Added a *wind_burst_on_hit* subcomponent for Projectiles which creates a wind burst upon collision with an entity or block before being removed from the world
- Wind Charges no longer burst when removed by command

## General

- “minecraft:scatter_feature” now has a “distribution” field like “minecraft:feature_rules” to define the scattering settings. Features now use schema version “1.21.10”
- [Learning portal documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/featuresreference/examples/features/minecraftscatter_feature?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable) on this feature will be updated with the full release

## Items

- Released *minecraft:custom_components* item component out of experimental in json formats 1.21.10 and higher
- Introduced “slot.armor.body” as an extra armor slot for entities, like horses, limited to a single armor item but needing the effects of a full armor set
- Introduced the “minecraft:damage_absorption” item component, enabling items to absorb damage intended for their wearer
  - The “absorbable_causes” field allows to specify which damage causes to absorb
  - Absorbed damage depletes the item’s durability, and surplus damage is ignored
  - Requires equipping the item in an armor slot for damage to be absorbed
  - When multiple damage absorbing items are equipped, a suitable one is selected at random to absorb incoming damage
- Introduced the “minecraft:durability_sensor” item component, enabling items to emit sounds and particles when damage causes them to lose durability
  - The “durability_thresholds” field allows to define a list of both durability thresholds and the effects to emit when they are met
  - When the item receives enough damage to meet multiple thresholds at the same time, only the one corresponding to the lowest durability is considered
- Learning portal documents on these features and how to use them are being written and will be available soon

## Realms

- Fixed a bug that prevented two back-to-back error screens when the client was out of date and a Realm had a pending update  
    

# **Experimental Technical Features**

## API

- Added *playerEmote* which fires after a player uses an emote
- Block Custom Components
  - Use of the ‘onTick’ event requires the block has the ‘minecraft:tick’ component to configure how the block ticks
  - Blocks that are world generated, and have the ‘minecraft:tick’ component, will now tick

## Graphical

- Added a Brightness / Gamma calibration screen for Deferred Technical Preview
  - The calibration screen can be found under Deferred Graphics Settings within the Video settings menu

## Stability and Performance

- Fixed a crash when enabling the Deferred Technical Preview experiment on Android devices with an Arm Mali GPU
