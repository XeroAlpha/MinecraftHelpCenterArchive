![A trial chamber, with some new items in item frames including an ominous key, an ominous bottle, and a splash potion of weaving](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/25581734744845)

This week we’re talking about mob effects, squashing bugs, and drinking from bottles very clearly labelled “ominous”! Ominous trials and ominous events are now part of a larger system of opt-in challenges that also includes the village raids you know and fear. Get an ominous bottle from a trial chamber vault or a raid captain and drink it to gain the Bad Omen effect. Then, head to a village to start a raid, or enter a trial chamber to begin an ominous trials! Ominous trials involve fighting tougher mobs, and dodging potions and projectiles spewing out of ominous trial spawners. Triumph over all of that and you’ll be able to unlock rarer rewards using your ominous trial key! *Wait…* so is the moral of this story that drinking from bottles labelled “ominous” is good? That can’t be right, can it? Anyway! We’d love your feedback on this grand finale of 1.21 features, so please let us know what you think at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net/), and report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).

# Experimental Features

## **Ominous Trials**

- A new Ominous Event that can be accessed by exploring a Trial Chamber with Bad Omen
- This event will have players facing more powerful Trial Spawners, if they dare!
- **Please note:** There are some changes that are already in the Java Edition Snapshot that haven’t made it here, but we are working on more tweaks that will be included in the upcoming Previews.

## **Ominous Bottle**

- An item which can be consumed by players to receive the Bad Omen effect for 1 hour and 40 minutes
  - Comes in 5 variations, one for each Bad Omen level
  - The bottle breaks when consumed
  - Can be stacked to 64
- Can be found uncommonly in any Vaults that are unlocked with Trial Keys, and is dropped by Raid Captains when defeated outside a Raid

## **Ominous Trial Key**

- A new variant of the Trial Key which can only be obtained by defeating an Ominous Trial Spawner
- They can be used to unlock Ominous Vaults

## **Ominous Trial Spawner**

- A more powerful active phase of the Trial Spawner with unique challenges and rewards
  - Provides a more challenging experience that players can opt into for better rewards
- If a Trial Spawner detects a player that has the Trial Omen effect, the spawner will become Ominous if:
  - It is not in cooldown
  - It is in cooldown but was not Ominous during its last activation
    - Making it Ominous this way will bypass the cooldown
  - While active, it will:
    - Glow blue instead of orange
    - Emit soul flames instead of normal flames
    - More commonly spawn mobs with equipment if they can wear it
      - The equipment these mobs wear have Armor Trims applied from the Trial Chambers
    - Periodically spawn potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs
  - Becoming Ominous will despawn any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge
    - It will stay Ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished
  - When defeated, it will eject a different set of loot than normal Trial Spawners

## **Ominous Vault**

- A variant of Vaults that have a different texture and emit soul flames instead of normal flames
- These can be found throughout the Trial Chambers in harder to find places and require an Ominous Trial Key to unlock
  - These Vaults hold a more valuable set of rewards than the standard Vaults unlocked by Trial Keys
- **Known Issue:** Vaults in Trial Chambers may generate without loot and cannot be opened by Trial Key

## **Ominous Events**

- Bad Omen has been expanded to give access to an optional experience in Trial Chambers
- These optional experiences accessed through Bad Omen are now known as Ominous Events
  - They are more challenging than usual, and are designed to shake up the experience in unique ways
  - Illager Raids are an example of an existing Ominous Event
- Bad Omen is getting some changes with this redesign:
  - It has a new, shadowy icon and a sound for being applied to the player
  - It is no longer given to players that defeat a Raid Captain outside a Raid
    - Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming a new Ominous Bottle

## **Trial Omen**

- A variant that Bad Omen can transform into
  - This occurs when the player is within detection range of a Trial Spawner that is not Ominous
  - The transformed Trial Omen has a duration of 15 minutes multiplied by the previous Bad Omen level
- Players that have Trial Omen are surrounded by ominous particles

## **Mob Effects**

- The following effects have been added:
  - Wind Charged
    - Affected entities will emit a wind burst upon death
    - Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Breeze Rod
  - Weaving
    - Affected entities will spread Cobweb blocks upon death
    - Non-player entities with this effect can walk through Cobweb at normal speeds
    - Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Cobweb block
  - Oozing
    - Affected entities will spawn two Slimes upon death
    - Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Slime Block
  - Infested
    - Affected entities have a 5% chance to spawn 1-2 Silverfish when hurt
    - Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Stone block
  - These effects can be encountered while taking on an Ominous Trial Spawner
    - Spawners in an area will select a unique effect for the duration of their challenge, and drop them as lingering potions onto mobs and players nearby
  - Some mobs are immune to these effects
    - Slimes are immune to Oozing
    - Silverfish are immune to Infested
  - **Known issue:** The duration of these mob effects is different to Java Edition and will be fixed soon

## **Breeze**

- The Breeze no longer Long Jumps into lava ([MCPE-177037](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-177037)) 
- Breeze now properly deflects most projectiles (except fireworks and fishing rod lures) ([MCPE-178900](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-178900))
- The Breeze now plays all of its sounds properly, even when off-screen ([MCPE-178507](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-178507)) 

## **Trial Chambers**

- Trial Chambers now generate slightly more rarely and a bit more spaced out from each other 

## **Trial Spawner**

- Trial Spawner activates only if it is in the line of sight of a player
- Ominous Trial Spawners in the same room are more likely to spawn the same selection of projectiles 
- Becoming Ominous will despawn any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge
- Trial Spawner in Ominous state spawns mobs with equipment they can wear 
  - That equipment will have Armor Trims from the Trial Chambers

## **Blocks**

- The Heavy Core can now be waterlogged
- The Heavy Core doesn't pop as an item when Lava or Water flows across it
- The Heavy Core can now be pushed and pulled by Pistons without breaking ([MCPE-179910](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-179910)) ([MCPE-179911](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-179911))
- The Heavy Core now has a map color of METAL
- The Heavy Core now has pickaxe as its preferred tool, and its destroy times have been adjusted 

## **Cobweb**

- Added unique sounds for Cobwebs ([MCPE-180109](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180109))

## **Wind Charge**

- Wind Charges no longer collide with nor destroy End Crystals ([MCPE-179304](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-179304))
- Wind Charges also no longer collide with other Wind Charges ([MCPE-179193](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-179193))

- Fixed various keys not being bindable when using external keyboards on mobile devices ([MCPE-176505](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-176505)) ([MCPE-176878](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-176878))

## **Blocks**

- The "tallgrass" block is now split into unique instances "short_grass" and "fern"

  - The rule can be set to "true" to re-enable the previous behavior where not all blocks would drop when exploded by TNT

## **Boat**

- Player can now stand on Boats that float on water ([MCPE-105535](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-105535)) ([MCPE-120687](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-120687)) 

## **Updated Edit World Screen**

## **Gameplay**

- When using an item on an entity, it is now necessary to release the use button before being able to use it again, which prevents players from inadvertently consuming items themselves when interacting with entities
- Sprinting speed is no longer activated with a delay ([MCPE-178858](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-178858))
- Ensure the right controller gets assigned to player 1 when playing on Xbox ([MCPE-163023](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-163023)) 

## **Marketplace**

- Fixed an issue that could cause the loading screen to get stuck for some time at 41% ([MCPE-175550](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-175550))

## **Mobs**

- Naturally spawning mobs now spawn at the center of a Block ([MCPE-99315](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-99315)) In this beta we updated natural mob spawns to have mobs spawn at the center of a block instead of at the corner of a block. This fixes many issues where mobs could not spawn on slopes, in narrow passageways and in other situations where they were expected to. For technical players, this bug fix will mean that some player-made mob farms no longer fully work. We appreciate the time the community puts into building clever farms and we try to avoid breaking farms when we can. In this case, we felt that this change was necessary because it improves the way spawning works in many biomes.

## **Realms**

## **Stability and Performance**

- Support prevention of app/flow restart when dark mode toggled on or off on across Android devices. 

## **User Interface**

- Fixed a bug where GUI scale was not modifiable after changing between handheld and docked mode on Switch consoles ([MCPE-159959](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-159959))
- Added missing indentation to list items in some modals, which should make those lists easier to read.
- On touch devices, when moving items between different slots, the icon no longer appears as duplicated between the moving item and the destination slot 
- On touch devices, when moving enchanted items between different slots, the moving icon is now rendered correctly 
- On touch devices, stack-splitting UI no longer appears for unstackable items
