# Fixes and Improvements

## Mobs

- Players riding Happy Ghasts no longer cause nearby Happy Ghasts to stop
  - This prevents players from blocking each other when flying Happy Ghasts too close together
- Ghast model is once again centered around its collision ([MCPE-220606](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-220606))
- Happy Ghast can now be pushed by other mobs even while being ridden, except when made immobile by a player standing on it

## Graphical

- The screen no longer turns bright white upon leaving the End in Vibrant Visuals ([MCPE-220333](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-220333))
- Turned off Vibrant Visuals by default on some console devices (Xbox One, Xbox One S, PlayStation 4)

## User Interface

- Fixed a crash that could occur when viewing the friends drawer

## Entity Filters

- Added the "is_vehicle_family" entity filter, which returns true when the subject entity is riding a vehicle with the specified family
