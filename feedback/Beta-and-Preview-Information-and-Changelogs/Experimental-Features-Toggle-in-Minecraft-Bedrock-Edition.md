## **What is an Experimental Features toggle?**

These can be found and activated in the "create new world" settings and "edit world" settings. The toggles allow players to try out features that are still in development.

## **How do I activate an Experimental Features toggle for my world?**

You can activate an experimental toggle for any new world you create and for existing worlds.

**Important**: Activating experimental features that are still under development means that your world might crash, break, or not work with future updates.

So, if you're planning to build an amazing castle that you want to impress your friends with, it's probably best to do it in a non-experimental world. 

### When creating a new world:

1.  Under “Game” settings, scroll down to "Experiments" and choose your toggle.

2\. When you get the popup asking "Activate Experimental Gameplay?", click "Activate Experiments".

###  When using an existing world:  *Note: While a copy of your world is generated automatically when activating an experimental feature toggle, in the event of something going wrong, you're also able to create copies of your world manually as an extra precaution.*

1.  1.  Go to 'Edit'.

    2.  Under “Game” settings, scroll down to "Experiments" and choose your toggle.

    2.  This will create a copy of your world that will get the same name as the original world with “Copy of...” added in front of it.

## **How do I know if my world has experimental features enabled?**

Once you’ve created a world that has an experimental feature toggle enabled, your world will get a "tag" next to the game mode in your Worlds list that says "Experimental".

Another way to identify if your world is using experimental toggles is to visit the settings for your world. On the "Game" world settings, scroll down to the "Experiments" section to see which experiments are enabled. 

## **Will it be possible to make an experimental world non-experimental later? **

No, worlds that use the experimental features toggle cannot be restored to a non-experimental state.
