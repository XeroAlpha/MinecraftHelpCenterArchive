# PlayStation 4 Preview

- To access the Preview, load into Minecraft, navigate to Settings, and select Preview in the sidebar to open the download page on PlayStation Store. Minecraft Preview is not available for disk owners of Minecraft

# Updated 'Servers Tab' Experience

**Update on Feb 23:** We're not quite ready to flip the switch on the new Servers tab but keep an eye out for it soon in an upcoming Preview release!  
  

An upcoming Preview will introduce a new way of playing on Featured Servers and others of your own. You will get to enjoy Featured Servers from our partners with exclusive environments, in a new visual style.

Some other features in this new design are the Server Activities and News.

You will also be able to add and edit your own custom server (on PC and mobile), setting all the parameters needed to invite your friends and have an enjoyable experience!

 

# Fixes

- Fixed 'minecraft:destroy_time' old components not updating to current version
