# PlayStation 4 Preview

- Minecraft Preview is now available on PlayStation 4! Get Minecraft Preview to experience the latest and greatest upcoming Minecraft features and provide feedback to the Mojang team
- To access the Preview, load into Minecraft, navigate to Settings, and select Preview in the sidebar to open the download page on PlayStation Store. Minecraft Preview is not available for disk owners of Minecraft
- Minecraft Preview runs as a separate game on PlayStation so you can continue to play both versions on your PS4 or PS5 (through backwards compatibility)  
    

# Updated 'Servers Tab' Experience

The latest Bedrock Preview introduces a new way of playing on Featured Servers and others of your own. You will get to enjoy Featured Servers from our partners with exclusive environments, in a new visual style.

Some other features in this new design are the Server Activities and News.

You are also able to add and edit your own custom server (on PC and mobile), setting all the parameters needed to invite your friends and have an enjoyable experience!  
  

**Changes:**

- Play Screen/Servers Tab is being updated with improved navigation, and a new look and feel that matches the new style in the screens. **It will be rolled out gradually across Android, iOS, Windows, and Xbox in the following days.**

We’re still working on some things, like support for other platforms, and some minor bugs and improvements. We would love to hear what you think! Share your feedback on the [Feedback Site](https://aka.ms/serverstabfeedback) and put “Servers Tab” in the title so we can find it.  
  

# Fixes

- Fixed 'minecraft:destroy_time' old components not updating to current version
