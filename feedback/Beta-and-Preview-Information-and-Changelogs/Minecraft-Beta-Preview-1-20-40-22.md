## **Editor**

The Editor and its corresponding API are in early development, and available for keyboard/mouse on Windows PC Bedrock Preview builds. Tag us on social channels with **#BedrockEditor.**

Learn [how to use](https://aka.ms/LearnEditor) the Editor, join the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions) forum to engage with the team, and get started building extensions via the [starter kit](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-starter-kit) and [samples](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-samples).

**Introducing this week**\...the *first* iteration towards our v0.5: Edit/Test Lite release! Here's the need-to-know -- read more in the [GitHub Release 0.4.5 notes](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions/categories/announcements):

-   Full round-trip edit \--\> (play)test experience within the context of the Editor
-   Customize your world conditions for testing
-   Changes you make in the test session will not be saved
-   Marketplace and persona are disabled in the test experience, which is also standard within the Editor
-   Available in single-player (*for now* ðŸ˜Š)

Additional fixes this week:

-   Fixed a bug in the Selection tool where the Y axis of the Vector3 origin exceeded the dimension height range
-   Fixed a bug where blocks couldn't be placed in the last block placed location after an undo

## **Entity Components**

-   The "behavior.random_look_around_and_sit" now has the field "continue_sitting_on_reload" exposed for Creators to use. This is how the Camel stays sitting on reload
-   "behavior.is_scenting" renamed to generic "behavior.timer_flag_1" and released to creators
-   "behavior.is_rising" renamed to generic "behavior.timer_flag_2" and released to creators
-   "behavior.is_feeling_happy" renamed to generic "behavior.timer_flag_3" and released to creators
-   "behavior.timer_flag 1": Fires an event when this behavior starts, then waits for a duration before stopping. When stopping due to that timeout or due to being interrupted by another behavior, fires another event. query.timer_flag_1 will return 1.0 on both the client and server when this behavior is running, and 0.0 otherwise
-   "behavior.timer_flag 2": Fires an event when this behavior starts, then waits for a duration before stopping. When stopping due to that timeout or due to being interrupted by another behavior, fires another event. query.timer_flag_2 will return 1.0 on both the client and server when this behavior is running, and 0.0 otherwise
-   "behavior.timer_flag 3": Fires an event when this behavior starts, then waits for a duration before stopping. When stopping due to that timeout or due to being interrupted by another behavior, fires another event. query.timer_flag_3 will return 1.0 on both the client and server when this behavior is running, and 0.0 otherwise

## **Mobs**

-   Added a new "query.is_in_lava" Query Function to Molang, to know if a mob is currently in Lava

## **Stability and Performance**

-   The Sounds definition file sound_definitions.json will no longer crash the game if the wrong json type is used for a specific sound definition ([MCPE-168913](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168913))\
    \

# **Experimental Technical**

## **API**

-   Added function *getWeather*

## **Stability and Performance**

-   Fixed a crash on certain Android devices (e.g. Mali GPUs) while loading into worlds with the Deferred Technical Preview enabled ([MCPE-173934](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-173934))
-   Disabled the Deferred Technical Preview on some Android devices that don't support our current requirements for compute shaders (GL_MAX_COMPUTE_WORK_GROUP_INVOCATIONS \>= 256)
