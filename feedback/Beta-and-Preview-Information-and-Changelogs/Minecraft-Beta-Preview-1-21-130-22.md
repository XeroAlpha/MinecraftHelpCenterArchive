# Technical Updates[](https://dev.azure.com/dev-mc/Minecraft/_wiki/wikis/Minecraft.wiki/30620/R21U13-2-Preview?anchor=technical-updates)

## AI Goals[](https://dev.azure.com/dev-mc/Minecraft/_wiki/wikis/Minecraft.wiki/30620/R21U13-2-Preview?anchor=ai-goals)

- Added the "minecraft:behavior.use_kinetic_weapon" AI goal
  - Description:
    - Allows a mob to make use of items with a "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" item component
    - The mob will approach the target before using the weapon and charging with it
    - If the target gets too close, the mob will retreat and reposition before charging again
    - Once all "max_duration"s in the item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component have elapsed, the mob goes on cooldown and retreats before approaching again
  - Fields:
    - "approach_distance": The distance to the target within which the mob begins using its kinetic weapon
    - "reposition_distance": The distance the mob retreats to once the target is closer than the midpoint of the item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component's minimum and maximum "reach"
    - "reposition_speed_multiplier": Multiplier applied to the mob's movement speed while repositioning
    - "cooldown_distance": The distance the mob retreats to after all of the item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component's "max_duration" values have elapsed
    - "cooldown_speed_multiplier": Multiplier applied to the mob's movement speed while on cooldown
    - "weapon_reach_multiplier": Multiplier applied to the item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component's "reach"
    - "weapon_min_speed_multiplier": Multiplier applied to each "min_speed" and "min_relative_speed" condition in the item's "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" component
    - "min_path_time": Minimum base time, in seconds, before recalculating a new attack path to the target (before increases are applied)
    - "max_path_time": Maximum base time, in seconds, before recalculating a new attack path to the target (before increases are applied)
    - "path_fail_time_increase": Time, in seconds, added to the attack path recalculation interval when the mob cannot move along the current path
    - "inner_boundary_time_increase": Time, in seconds, added to the attack path recalculation interval when the target is beyond "path_inner_boundary"
    - "outer_boundary_time_increase": Time, in seconds, added to the attack path recalculation interval when the target is beyond "path_outer_boundary"
    - "path_inner_boundary": Distance at which to increase attack path recalculation by "inner_boundary_time_increase"
    - "path_outer_boundary": Distance at which to increase attack path recalculation by "outer_boundary_time_increase"
    - "speed_multiplier": Multiplier applied to the mob's movement speed when moving toward its target
    - "require_complete_path": Specifies whether a full navigation path from the mob to the target is required
    - "track_target": Allows the mob to track its target even if it lacks a hard-coded sensing component
    - "cooldown_time": Cooldown time, in seconds, between consecutive attacks
    - "melee_fov": Field of view, in degrees, used by the hard-coded sensing component to detect a valid attack target
    - "x_max_rotation": Maximum rotation, in degrees, on the X-axis while the mob is trying to look at its target
    - "y_max_head_rotation": Maximum rotation, in degrees, on the Y-axis while the mob is trying to look at its target
    - "random_stop_interval": Defines a 1-in-N chance for the mob to stop its current attack, where N equals "random_stop_interval"
    - "attack_once": Allows the mob to perform this melee attack behavior only once during its lifetime
  - Requirements:
    - The mob must have an item with the "minecraft:kinetic_weapon" item component
    - Must otherwise fulfill the same conditions as other melee attack goals
- "minecraft:behavior.melee_box_attack", "minecraft:behavior.delayed_attack", "minecraft:behavior.melee_attack" and "minecraft:behavior.stomp_attack" now correctly apply their "path_inner_boundary" field

## API[](https://dev.azure.com/dev-mc/Minecraft/_wiki/wikis/Minecraft.wiki/30620/R21U13-2-Preview?anchor=api)

  - Released field `"shaded"` formerly called `"emissive"` from experimental

# Experimental Technical Updates[](https://dev.azure.com/dev-mc/Minecraft/_wiki/wikis/Minecraft.wiki/30620/R21U13-2-Preview?anchor=experimental-technical-updates)

## API[](https://dev.azure.com/dev-mc/Minecraft/_wiki/wikis/Minecraft.wiki/30620/R21U13-2-Preview?anchor=api)

- Debug Drawing
  - Fixed a bug where `timeLeft` would cause the `DebugShape` to be removed immediately
  - Fixed a bug where the arrow head of the `DebugArrow` would look incorrect at certain rotations

## API Infra[](https://dev.azure.com/dev-mc/Minecraft/_wiki/wikis/Minecraft.wiki/30620/R21U13-2-Preview?anchor=api-infra)

- Modernized AvailableCommandsPacket serialization. Added these constraints:
  - Chained Subcommand Data / Name max size set to 512 characters
  - Commands / Name max size set to 512 characters
  - Commands / Description max size set to 1000 characters
  - Commands / Chained Subcommand Indexes max size set to 250 elements
  - Commands / Overloads max size set to 250 elements
  - Constraints / Constraint Indices max size set to 250 elements

## Blocks[](https://dev.azure.com/dev-mc/Minecraft/_wiki/wikis/Minecraft.wiki/30620/R21U13-2-Preview?anchor=blocks)

- Added component `minecraft:connection_rule` behind the Upcoming Creator Features toggle which allows custom blocks to define whether other blocks with connection behavior - such as fences, walls, bars, and glass panes - can try to create a connection
- Added VanillaBlockTag `minecraft:has_fence_connections` that can be used to identify a custom block as a block that creates connections like a fence; this tag is required to create connections between custom and Vanilla fences
- The component and tag can be used along with the `minecraft:connection` block trait to make a custom fence that creates connections like a Vanilla fence. The following is an example of how they fit into the JSON of a custom fence block:

``` auto
{
    "format_version": "1.21.130",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "test:my_fence",
            "traits": {
                "minecraft:connection": {
                    "enabled_states": ["minecraft:cardinal_connections"]
                }
            }
        },
        "components": {
            "tag:minecraft:has_fence_connections": {},
            "minecraft:connection_rule": {
                "accepts_connections_from": "only_fences"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
