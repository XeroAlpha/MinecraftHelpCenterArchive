However, these changes are not yet final, and they will stay as experimental features while we continue to work on them. We still need your feedback to help us improve and decide, so please continue to let us know what you think of the new trades, what you like and dislike, and what suggestions you have at [aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback](http://aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback).
