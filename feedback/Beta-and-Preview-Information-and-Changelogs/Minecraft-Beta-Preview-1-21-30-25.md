# Features and Bug Fixes

## Gameplay

- Reverted a change that caused several bugs with the Mace regarding stacking, enchanting, and durability. As a consequence, mobs are once again unable to do Mace Smash attacks. This will be fixed at a later time ([MCPE-185896](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185896) )
