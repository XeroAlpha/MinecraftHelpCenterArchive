# Technical Updates

## Add-Ons and Script Engine

- Added the ability to define the order for the items for the creative inventory & recipe book, called the crafting item catalog, for new items added by packs. New items can either merge with existing groups, create new groups with your own item for the icon, or just become added as loose items without a group. This catalog should be saved as `item_catalog/crafting_item_catalog.json` in your behavior pack  
  Example:

``` hljs
{
   "format_version": "1.21.60",
   "minecraft:crafting_items_catalog": {
      "categories": [
         {
            // Valid values are construction, equipment, nature, and items
            "category_name": "construction",
            "groups": [
               {
                  // This will add the items to the end of the
                  // existing planks group
                  "group_identifier": {
                     "icon": "minecraft:oak_planks",
                     "name": "minecraft:itemGroup.name.planks"
                  },
                  "items": [
                     "mynamespace:my_planks1",
                     "mynamespace:my_planks2"
                  ]
               },
               {
                  // This will create a new group
                  "group_identifier": {
                     "icon": "mynamespace:my_item",
                     // This is the name of your group which doubles as
                     // the localization string. The namespace is required
                     "name": "mynamespace:my_group_name"
                  },
                  "items": [
                     "mynamespace:my_item"
                  ]
               },
               {
                  // This adds items without being part of a
                  // group as loose items
                  "items": [
                     "mynamespace:my_loose_item"
                  ]
               }
            ]
         }
      ]
   }
}
```
