# Technical Updates

## Biomes

### Client Biome Components

- Add `minecraft:dry_foliage_color` component to override color for `dry_foliage` tint method

## Blocks

- Empty Bell blocks no longer crash the game when moved by a sticky piston ([MCPE-188687](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188687))
- Updated the /fill, /clear and /testforblock Commands
  - Fixed a bug where these commands would recognize IDs of some flattened blocks as block group names and affect all variants under those groups
- Add `dry_foliage` tint method which uses the `textures/colormap/dry_foliage.png` color map
- Exposed the Block component minecraft:destruction_particles as a JSON object. This represents the particles used when the Block is destroyed
  - There is two fields for it:
    - "texture" is a required string field to set the texture used by the particles
    - "tint_method" is an optional string field that multiplies the texture color with a predefined tint. Default to "none". Supported values are "none", "default_foliage", "birch_foliage", "evergreen_foliage", "dry_foliage", "grass" and "water".
  - Block format before 1.21.70 will be upgraded to have the component added using the texture from the "down" or "\*" of the minecraft:material_instances component if present and "none" for tint_method. This was the old behavior.
  - Block format from 1.21.70 without the component will not be upgraded and uses the invalid texture  
    Examples:
    ``` hljs
     "minecraft:destruction_particles": {
      "texture": "my_particles_texture",
      "tint_method": "grass"
     }
    ```

    or
    ``` hljs
    "minecraft:destruction_particles": {
     "texture": "my_particles_texture"
    }
    ```

## Bug

## Commands

- Removed set_movement_authority command.

## Dedicated Server

- Exposed a new parameter for dedicated server. This will make the server more strict on entity interactions. Look in server.properties for more information on what these do
  - server-authoritative-entity-interactions-strict default to false and can be set to true. Will affect Entity interaction acceptance
- Removed server-authoritative-movement parameter. It will now always use server-auth-with-rewind.

## Editor

  - Users can now publish their Editor project directly to Realms
  - Users can download their Realms world

- Fixed an issue where native constructors were not properly checking privileges when being called. Constructors now check privileges properly and produce correct errors when being used in Early Execution privilege.
- Deprecated `ItemUseOnBeforeEvent` in `@minecraft/server` 2.0.0-beta. Use `PlayerInteractWithBlockBeforeEvent` instead
