Please remember that this beta is for Android only. The bug fixes and changes made for other platforms will not reflect until the full release of this update. Also, we advise all of our beta players to make back-ups of their saved games before running them on new beta builds.

**Bug Fixes:**

-   Fixed a crash when trying to ride a horse.
-   Fixed a crash when trying to feed an animal.
-   The Ender dragon now goes towards the crystal actually closest to it.
-   Fixed a crash when a player loaded a large resource pack and tried to apply it to a new world.
-   Fixed a crash on some Android devices that was due to an ExceptionHolder error.
