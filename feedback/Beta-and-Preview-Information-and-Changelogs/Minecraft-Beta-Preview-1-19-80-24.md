# **Features and Bug Fixes**

## **General**

-   Fixed several crashes that could occur during gameplay
-   Simulation distance is no longer reset to default after entering a world ([MCPE-168513](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168513))
-   Resolved an issue that prevented items from being equipped on Armor Stands ([MCPE-169133](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-169133))
    -   This means that we have temporarily reverted the fix for not being able to pose an Armor Stand whilst flying, and we hope to have this fixed soon ([MCPE-168548](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168548))

## **User Interface**

-   We are temporarily reverting the change which focused the keyboard input on the search bar in the Creative inventory, which will address the following issues while we work on a solution:
    -   Hovering above the enchantment options in Enchantment Table again shows the enchantments on mobile devices using the Pocket UI profile setting ([MCPE-168498](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168498))
    -   The Q and E shortcut keys can again be used in the Creative inventory screen ([MCPE-168697](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168697))

# **Technical Updates**
