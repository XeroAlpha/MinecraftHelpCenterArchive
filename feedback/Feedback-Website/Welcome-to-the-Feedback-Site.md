**(Most recent update: 7 April 2020)**

This site is a great place for you to talk to other Minecraft players and submit cool ideas that the developers might not have thought of - the best ones might even end up in-game! If you have submitted feedback before or are brand new, please look around – we have made some changes to submitting feedback.

## **What happened to...**

### **My old feedback (before 22 May 2018)?**

Feedback is now sorted by topic, **not by platform**. This allows you the ability to save time finding ideas and for us to add more categories as needed for special topics. This also lets us provide places for categories that haven't had a home before or were awkwardly sitting in categories that didn't fit due to technical restraints.

We also changed the software powering the feedback site. While the site looks similar, the technology is different.

We decided to take a **fresh slate approach by removing old feedback posts**. [Read the guidelines before posting!](./Posting-Guidelines.md) We apologize for this inconvenience and look forward to seeing you revisit some of your older ideas (if you have saved them) and give them a refresh too.

Please note, old posts will not be restored from the previous version of the feedback site.

### **Platform-specific feedback areas? **

When we evaluated our existing feedback site, it became clear to us that many of your ideas were similar, if not 100% identical to each other. Focusing on topics lets great ideas be seen easier, decreases duplicate posting, and encourages more discussion about the topic without focusing exclusively on the platform it sits upon.

Please note duplicate posts on the same topic are subject to deletion, and topics that are categorized in an area that doesn't fit the content of the post will most likely be moved to the best fit category. Please search!

### **The Knowledge Base?**

We changed the categories based on the content that currently exists and the content we are looking to add. As a result, we ended up with five categories. This allowed us to split the beta changelogs away from release changelogs, for example. (If you aren't interested in beta changelogs, this will probably help you!)

### **World Seeds, Realm advertisements, Gamertags, and the “look here for new friends to play with on Xbox Live!” thread?**

In an effort to keep our feedback focused on direct, actionable feedback, we have eliminated these categories.

### **My new feedback?**

It may have been moved to a more appropriate category. It may have been removed because it isn't feedback.

We reserve the right to delete, move, or adjust posts for the following reasons:

\- duplicate feedback across categories

\- posts that singularly serve as "pointer posts" to other posts, on or off the feedback.minecraft.net website

\- attempts to "boost" feedback to the top or campaigns for votes

\- comments or feedback that do not fall in accordance with [our posting guidelines](./Posting-Guidelines.md)

\- feedback that reopens previously closed threads (if it's closed, it's probably closed for a reason)

\- we may occasionally rename suggestions or add subject line information for clarity. This is to assist other community members in finding your feedback
