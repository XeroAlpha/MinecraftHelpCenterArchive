## **We have a fresh new system of categories! Woo!**

Feedback Site Changes since 25 May 2018:

\* [Code and Commands](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/360000332412-Code-and-Commands) exists.

\* [How to Join and Leave Beta information](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360004438671) has been given a permanent home.

\* [We have created a guide to making great feedback, and now it is in handy Knowledge Base form.](./Creating-Great-Ideas.md) 

\* Biomes and dimensions is now Biomes, Dimensions, and Structures!

\* Graphics is now Graphics and Sounds.

\* Input Methods (touch, keyboard, etc) has been added to [User Interface, Input Methods and Menus](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/360000280611-User-Interface-Input-Methods-and-Menus) - if you want to add a button, this is where that suggestion goes.

Fixes

\* The copyright year was serving us some 2016 vibes, but we've updated that to 2018.

\* The Terms of Service has been brought back to life, and at least the link is updated. You can find them here: [https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360004305512](../Gameplay-and-Support-Resources/Terms-of-Service.md)
