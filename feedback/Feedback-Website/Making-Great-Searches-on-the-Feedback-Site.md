The **search box** is located on every single page of the Feedback site. Just enter a word or two about the topic you want to post about and hit return. Helpful hint: if you have more than one word, use quotes around each word to get the best results! Like "kelp" "tea" instead of "kelp tea". It\'s amazing what you can find with one word.

Unlikely you\'ll need to search for this. Minecraft makes you plenty happy, right?

The site also suggests related threads when you enter a new post for your idea. It also helps if you** keep your ideas to a single idea per post.** That way people know what they're voting for! (And it makes it easy to search.)

Cutting down on threads with very similar ideas will let ideas stay together so they can receive the attention they deserve. If you read an idea and have a better way to do the same thing or a completely different approach to the same basic idea, join the discussion! You don\'t need to start a new thread because the ideas aren\'t exactly the same.

We read all the comments when we look at a post and keep them in mind because we know there may be more than one great way to implement an idea!
