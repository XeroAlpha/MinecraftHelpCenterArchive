**Updated 21 May 2020**

This article is designed to help you post your ideas on the Feedback site, and edit them.

### **Notes about Moderator Edits and Comments on your posts**

We do our best to help out in ways large and small to help your ideas get seen. Common actions include:

*Changing the subject line.* We do this to improve search results.  

*Moving your post to a different category.* Figuring out where to post can be hard, and we know it, so we might move your idea to where it fits better. 

## **Step One: Search**

Your feedback site is an issue-based site, not a platform based site. An idea that is for all Minecraft platforms is **100% better** and more likely to be adopted sooner. 

The Search box is located on **every single page** of the Feedback site. 

Remember: Don\'t repost other people\'s ideas, even if they posted it months or YEARS ago and have never come back to update it.

When we present issues to the team, we look at the issue, not the person who posted it, so reposting it doesn\'t actually help it get seen faster by our developers.

## **Step Two: Check Previously Considered Suggestions**

## **Step Three: Post!**

Wait! Before you hit that submit button\...

Ask yourself:

-   Do not include **any outside links**? For the safety of our users, we do not accept links outside of official Minecraft pages (JIRA and the official Minecraft wiki are okay, YouTube is not).
-   Is it a list of things or does it contain things that are unrelated?  
-   Did I use a lot of bold or italics? If you\'re using them for the entire post, that\'s really hard to read for some people.

Your post should appear right away. [If not, go here to see what may have happened.](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360011793092)

## **Step Four: How to Edit Your Post**

The wheel shows you a menu of options, including edit. Use that to fix your typos and add things you may have missed.

Do not change your post to entirely change the meaning of your original idea. You can also delete your own post.

## **Step Five: Continue to Contribute and Enjoy!**

It\'s time to live the dream and watch those votes stack up on your post. Social media is here for you!

Remember if you don\'t get a lot of votes right away, that\'s okay too. There are brand new ideas every day on this site and sometimes posts (especially big ones) take a while to get noticed. Don\'t bump posts.

## **Step Six: Follow Posts you like and be nice to the ones you don\'t.**

Everyone works hard on their ideas and to approach your feedback for others in a nice way. \"No\" by itself is not feedback.  Be sure to have reasons when you agree and disagree!
