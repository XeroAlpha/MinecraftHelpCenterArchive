**What's New (September 2018)**

\* [Bedrock Betas](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/115000409672-Bedrock-Betas?sort_by=votes) and [Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshots](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/360000736431-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Snapshots?sort_by=votes) are now two categories.

\* [Beta Information and Changelogs](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/360001185332-Beta-Information-and-Changelogs) and [Snapshot Information and Changelogs](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/360002267532-Snapshot-Information-and-Changelogs) are two categories. Release category has not changed.

\* Code and Commands has been renamed to [Creator Tools](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/360000332412-Creator-Tools?sort_by=votes) 

\* [Realms and Dedicated Servers](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/360000721951-Realms-and-Dedicated-Servers?sort_by=votes) has been added, because it didn't make sense to keep this in Minecraft (General) anymore.

\* The categories were arranged, then put back into alphabetical order. That was a test that didn't net the results we wanted, so we went back to alphabetizing.

\* Details are now required when you post. This will keep entire post out of the subject line (in theory) and encourage everyone to actually explain their idea.

\* Posts are now sorted by number of votes. If that's not your thing we still have every sorting option we can currently offer.
