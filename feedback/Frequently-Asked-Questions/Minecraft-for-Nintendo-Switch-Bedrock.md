**Q: What is the Bedrock version of Minecraft? **

A: The Bedrock version of Minecraft has been the codebase on mobile and Windows 10 since 2012, also known as our Bedrock Engine.  We brought this version to Xbox One with the Better Together Update last fall and now we’re launching it on Nintendo Switch.

 

**Q: How is this version different than the one I already own?**

A: Minecraft delivers a united experience to players on all platforms that the Bedrock codebase is used. Build with friends via cross-play on Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile devices, play multiplayer mini-games through servers\*, and customize how you play with community content available through the in-game marketplace.   
\*Servers available via post-launch update at a later date

A: All of the existing DLC content will be transferable from Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition to the new version of Minecraft. 

 

**Q: What’s a Microsoft Account and why do I need it for a Nintendo Switch?**

A: A Microsoft Account is a free account you can sign-in on device that allows Minecraft players on Switch to play with others on non-Nintendo devices like iOS, Android, Xbox One and Windows 10 via cross-play, Realms or Servers. Having a Microsoft Account also enables the portability of your MINECOINS and marketplace purchases to other devices and platforms.

Make sure you are entering your friend’s Gamertag correctly. Please note that you are only able to enter in a player ID for Microsoft’s Gamertag. Other player IDs from other platforms are not supported at this time. 

 

**Q: Do I need to pay a subscription fee like Xbox LIVE Gold to play online?**

A: Online subscription fees are determined by the platform you play on, so an Xbox LIVE Gold subscription is not required for Nintendo Switch players but a Nintendo Switch Online subscription will be required for multiplayer when that service launches. A free Microsoft Account is recommended for players to get the most out of this version of Minecraft.

 

**Q: What is Minecraft Marketplace?**

A: The Minecraft Marketplace is what we call our Store which you can find in-game. For the first time, new character skins, textures, and worlds made by creators in the Minecraft community are coming to the in-game store for Minecraft Bedrock platforms. With Minecraft Marketplace, we've made it safer and easier to purchase community-made content for Minecraft. Buy content once while signed in with a Microsoft account and enjoy it on any supported device with no expiration. 

 

**Q: What are Minecoins?**

A:  Purchasable with real currency in the game store and eShop, Minecoins (Minecraft coins) let you buy content from creators in our Marketplace, safely and securely.

**Q: Do my existing worlds transfer?**

A: Yes, your existing worlds from Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition will convert over to the new version of Minecraft. There is currently no way to transfer worlds directly from Wii U, but it is something we are looking at for the future.

 

**Q:  How do I transfer existing worlds from “Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition” to “Minecraft”**  
 

A:  *In Minecraft (Bedrock Version):*

- A button “Sync Old Worlds” on the bottom of the worlds list in the play menu will find any worlds on the device from the 4J Switch version and display them below the button.
- Select any of the newly found worlds to convert it to Bedrock edition
- After conversion the world will show up above the Sync Old Worlds button with the rest of your Bedrock worlds.

*From Wii U Edition to Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition:*

Make sure both Wii U and Switch are on the same Wi-Fi network and are connected to Nintendo Network  
 

On Wii U:

- Select Play Game
- In your worlds list, hover over the world you want to transfer and hit X for Save Options
- Select “Transfer Save to Nintendo Switch” button on the bottom and hit ok on the popup that appears
- Transfer save progress bar should appear and will sit there while you perform the other half of the transfer on the Switch

On Switch:

- Select Play Game
- Hit Y to “Transfer Save from Wii U”
- Select Yes on the popup that appears
- Progress bar for Transfer Save should appear and start filling as the save data transfers between the consoles.

**Q: How big are worlds in this version of Minecraft for Nintendo Switch?**

A: World size is infinite in Minecraft for Nintendo Switch.

 

**Q:  I’m playing in a world that was transferred from the previous version, are there limitations on the size?**

A:  Transferring to Minecraft should change the world type to infinite, keeping the portions of the world from the 4J version the same, but generating new chunks outside of that area.

 

**Q: Can I play Realms on this edition?**

A: Yes, Realms is available on the Bedrock edition of Minecraft for Nintendo Switch. To play online on a Nintendo Switch, you need to have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, so this is a requirement for playing on Realms.

**Q: Can my friends on Xbox play the Super Mario Mash-Up?**

A: No, the Super Mario Mash-Up is only playable by Nintendo Switch owners in single player, split screen, local network and over Nintendo Switch Online.
