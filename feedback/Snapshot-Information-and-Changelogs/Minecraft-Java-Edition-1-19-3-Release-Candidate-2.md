We've now released 1.19.3 Release Candidate 2, fixing a few critical issues.

With release candidate 2, we are reverting a behavior change for translation strings due to a prevalent but unsupported use case. Expect this behavior to be changed in the future to provide a supported alternative.

# FIXED BUGS IN 1.19.3 RELEASE CANDIDATE 2

- [MC-258251](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-258251)- Slots (like %s) in translations no longer ignore missing elements in "with"
- [MC-258256](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-258256)- Cannot join a LAN world while offline
