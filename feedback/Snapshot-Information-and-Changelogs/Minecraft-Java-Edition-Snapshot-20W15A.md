## NETHER MUSIC

We’re happy to announce that we’ve added three new tracks for the upcoming Nether Update, all composed by the very talented Lena Raine. 

- *Rubedo* will be played in the Nether Wastes
- *Chrysopoeia *will be played in Crimson Forests 
- *So Below *will be played in Soulsand Valleys and in Basalt Deltas

Two lines from Lena about the music. More to come in a separate blog post.

- "One of the primary instruments in Minecraft is the piano, and so one of my challenges to myself was to see how far I could push the sound of the piano until it resembled other things entirely–again, that alchemical process."
- "I wanted each piece to feel like a progression of emotions, or a journey from place to place within this other world. There's a degree of beauty to the Nether, but it is also terrifying in both its details and scale."

Take a portal to the Nether, and stay awhile and listen…
