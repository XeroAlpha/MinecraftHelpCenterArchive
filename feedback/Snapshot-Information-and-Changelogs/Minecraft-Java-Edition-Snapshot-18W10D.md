- Water no longer goes through solid faces
- Coral now generates naturally
- Big optimization to how clouds are rendered
- Phantoms now burn in sunlight
- You can now undye shulker boxes in a cauldron

  
**Water Physics**  
  
Oops, we spilled a bit.

- You can place water in the following blocks: stairs, slabs, fences, walls, iron bars, glass panes
- Water can flow out these blocks, but can not flow into them
- When full of water, they will count as water blocks for all gameplay (such as swimming)
- This isn't final and more blocks may contain water in the future
- Right now it will flow out of all faces of the block - this will change
- We have removed the blocks flowing_water and flowing_lava
- We have removed the block tags water_hacked and waterlogged
- All of the above blocks now have a state waterlogged
- Blocks such as bubble column or kelp will always count as a water source

  
**Buried Treasure**  
  
We found this cool stuff! Let's hide it.

- Can be found... somewhere?
- Maps found in Underwater Ruins can lead you to them
- Will contain a very cool treasure... which isn't added yet

  
**Tropical Fish**  
  
We found nemo! And all his friends!

- They come in many colours!
- They come in many patterns!
- Like other fish, you can catch them up in a bucket
- You can find them in warm and lukewarm oceans

  
**Map markers**  
  
You are here. Or there. I'm not sure, it's somewhere here.

- Right click on a banner with a map to add it to the map
- Right click on the same banner again to remove it
- That map will show the colour of the banner at that spot
- Named banners will show their name on the map too
- If a banner is destroyed, it'll disappear when you get close and are holding the map

  
**Phantom**  
  
""Less derpy"" - Jeb

- Now despawn during the day
- No longer spawn in The End
- They have a new model! And texture! Pretty neat.
