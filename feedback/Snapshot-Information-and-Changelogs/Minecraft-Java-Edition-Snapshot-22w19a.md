Thursday snapshot! Apart from some bugfixes and some changes to fancy tags and commands, we\'re introducing \"chat preview\" as a way to cryptographically sign chat messages that have been dynamically styled by servers. And for this snapshot only, we\'ve left in our testing option test-rainbow-chat in server.properties, which can be set to true together with the new previews-chat option for testing. If this is something that interests you, and especially if you run a server, we would love your feedback on it.

Enjoy!

# CHANGES IN 22W19A

-   Warden and Iron Golems now make sure to spawn above something solid

# TECHNICAL CHANGES IN 22W19A

-   Servers can now enable Chat Preview, which displays a server-controlled preview above the chat edit box
-   Changes to the locate and place commands
-   Point of Interest tags

## CHAT PREVIEW

-   Servers can enable Chat Preview by setting previews-chat=true in server.properties
-   When enabled, a server-controlled preview appears above the chat edit box, showing how the message will look when sent
-   This can be used by servers to preview messages with styling applied, such as emojis or chat coloring
-   Chat Preview sends chat messages to the server as they are typed, even before they're sent
    -   The server then sends back the styled preview in real time
    -   This allows servers to apply dynamic message stylings while still allowing chat to be securely signed
-   A warning screen is shown on the client when joining a server with Chat Preview, and it can be globally disabled in Chat Settings
-   Dynamic chat styling can also be controlled by the server, although this is only signed when Chat Preview is enabled
    -   Clients can prefer to always show the original, signed message by enabling "Only Show Signed Chat" in Chat Settings

## COMMANDS

-   Added template sub-command to place command
-   locate command moved to locate structure, locatebiome moved to locate biome
-   Added locate poi \<type: point_of_interest_type\>
-   Servers will now also send an additional icon and MOTD packet after a player has connected
    -   This allows servers with enable-status=false to set an icon and MOTD for players that successfully connect

### PLACE TEMPLATE

The place command can now also place templates at a given location. Syntax:\
place template \<template\> \[pos\] \[rotation\] \[mirror\] \[integrity\] \[seed\]

-   place template works like using the load button in the UI for a structure block

Parameters:

-   template: The namespaced id of a template ("structure block file") to load and place
-   rotation: The rotation to apply (if omitted, none is used)
-   mirror: The mirroring to apply (if omitted, none is used)
-   integrity: The structure integrity value between 0 and 1
-   seed: The seed to use for the randomized degradation when integrity is less than 1

## POINT OF INTEREST TYPES

-   Removed unemployed and nitwit point_of_interest_types
-   Added tag point_of_interest_type/acquirable_job_site for all job sites seeked by Villagers with none profession
-   Added tag point_of_interest_type/village for PoI that are part of Village
-   Added tag point_of_interest_type/bee_home for all PoI targeted by Bees
