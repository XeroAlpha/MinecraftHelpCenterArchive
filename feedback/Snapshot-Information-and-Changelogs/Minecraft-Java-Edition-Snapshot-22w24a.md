New snapshot! We're now heading towards 1.19.1, which will add Allay duplication, the ability to report chat, and, of course, fix a few bugs. 

On the topic of chat reporting, we want everyone to feel safe and welcome in Minecraft, which is why we have community guidelines in place. If you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, or concerned that someone is breaking our [Community Guidelines](https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards) or the [Xbox Community Standards](https://www.xbox.com/legal/community-standards), you can soon report this in-game. Of course, it will also be possible to report incidents over at the [Report a Concern](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4416074743565) page.

We are looking for feedback regarding the Chat Reporting feature. For now, any reports made during the testing period may not be actioned on.

Enjoy!
