The first pre-release for 1.19.1 is now available. This release contains a few bugfixes, an increased cooldown for Allay duplication, and it also contains a new UI if you have been banned for violating the Minecraft [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards).\
​\
On the topic of community standards and the recent introduction of the chat reporting feature, we're working on creating a help article that aims to add some context surrounding the functionality.\
​\
All of this said, if everything goes as planned, we plan to release the update next Tuesday on June 28th.
