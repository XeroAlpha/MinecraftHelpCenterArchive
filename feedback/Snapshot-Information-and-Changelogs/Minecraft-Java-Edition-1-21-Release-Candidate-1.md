Here is the first Release Candidate for 1.21, addressing some critical issues. Apart from that we decided to revert the changes made in Pre-Release 4 to armor enchantments based on your feedback.

Happy mining!

## CHANGES

- The changes to Burn Time reduction from Fire Protection and Knockback reduction from Blast Protection from pre-release 4 have been reverted
  - We have heard your feedback, and we expect to rebalance these two enchantments in the future to find a better place for them
  - Values are now the same as in 1.20.6
  - These effects still stack from wearing multiple pieces (changed from 1.20.6)
