**Changes in 18W14B**

-   Renamed coral blocks (See below for details)
-   New coral fan textures
-   Destroying waterlogged blocks will only destroy the block, not the water

\
**Phantom Membrane**\
\
Very spooky.

-   Elytra now requires Phantom Membrane to be repaired
-   Phantoms now drop Phantom Membrane instead of leather
-   Can be crafted into a super spooky Slow Falling potion

\
**Advancements**\
\
We\'re making progress!

-   **Fishy Business:** Catch a fish
-   **Tactical fishing:** Catch a fish\... without a fishing rod!
-   **A Throwaway Joke:** Throw a trident at something. Note: throwing away your only weapon is not a good idea.
-   **Very Very Frightening:** Strike a Villager with lightning
-   More to come!

\
**Riptide**\
\
Whooosh!

-   No longer compatible with Loyalty or Channeling
-   If riptide won\'t work (such as being on land, nice and dry) you can\'t attack with the trident at all
-   Riptide will not throw the trident, but instead launch you forwards with the trident
-   Looks neat!

\
**Coral Names**\
\
Hopefully the last time they get renamed!

-   All full blocks of coral are now called \"\"coral block\"\"
-   Coral plants are now called \"\"coral\"\"
-   \"\"blue\"\" coral is now called \"\"tube\"\" coral
-   \"\"pink\"\" coral is now called \"\"brain\"\" coral
-   \"\"purple\"\" coral is now called \"\"bubble\"\" coral
-   \"\"red\"\" coral is now called \"\"fire\"\" coral
-   \"\"yellow\"\" coral is now called \"\"horn\"\" coral
-   For example, \"\"blue coral\"\" is now \"\"tube coral block\"\"
-   For example, \"\"purple coral plant\"\" is now \"\"bubble coral\"\"

\
**Sea Pickles**\
\

-   What to call them? It\'s really quite a pickle.
-   Generate either by themselves in warm oceans, or with coral
-   Up to 4 pickles can be placed in a block
-   Emits light depending on how many pickles there are per block
-   Can be smelted down into green dye
-   Pickle.
