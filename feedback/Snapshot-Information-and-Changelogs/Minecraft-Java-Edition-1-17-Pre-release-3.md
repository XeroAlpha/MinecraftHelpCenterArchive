It's Monday and it's time for another pre-release! This one fixed a few bugs and crashes.

In case you missed our recent [news](https://www.minecraft.net/article/caves---cliffs--part-i-has-release-date-.html), we just announced that we're releasing Caves & Cliffs Part I on June 8th. That's soon!

**Update:** we've now released 1.17 pre-release 3.

Note that a bug has snuck into this pre-release making the game warn about every world as if it was experimental. This will be fixed in the next pre-release.

# CHANGES IN 1.17 PRE-RELEASE 3

- Tweaked the textures of lit candles
- Mobs rammed by goats will no longer retaliate
- Axolotls and Glow Squids now only spawn in total darkness and where there's a natural stone block less than 5 blocks below the spawning space
