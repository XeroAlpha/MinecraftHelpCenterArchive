Time for another pre-release! This time around we've fixed some issues with the new social interactions screen, as well as some crashes.

In case you haven't heard, yesterday we announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. With this pre-release, we are preparing for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about that over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house.html), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360050865492). The FAQ will be continuously updated.

We aim to release 1.16.4 sometime during next week.
