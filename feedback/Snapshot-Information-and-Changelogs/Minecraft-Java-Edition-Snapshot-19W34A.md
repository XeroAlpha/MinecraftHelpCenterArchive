What happens when our dev teams spends the summer eating nothing but honey? We get inspired to add a new mob - the flappy fuzzball that is the bee! We also got very sick. A balanced diet is important!

# BEE

We're buzzing with excitement!

Can someone tell Cory to stop making bee puns now?

-   Bees are cute, fuzzy, neutral mobs
-   Don't hurt them, they don't want to hurt you
-   If a bee does sting you, it will leave its stinger in you and eventually die, dropping nothing :(
-   Bees love pretty flowers and spend their lives gathering pollen from them
-   After gathering pollen, bees fly back to their home nest
-   Bees help you by growing crops while carrying pollen back to the nest
-   Bees can be bred using flowers
-   Bees like sharing the location of their favorite flowers with other bees
-   If a bee can\'t find nectar, after a while it will return home for a bit
-   If a bee doesn't have a home nest, it will wander around until it finds one it can use
-   Bees don't like the rain and they sleep at night. They will go back to the nest in these cases

# BEE NESTS / BEE HIVES

In real life, bees dance in their nests to show other bees where flowers are!

-   Bee Nests spawn naturally in Flower Forests, Plains, and Sunflower Plains biomes
-   When a bee visits this block and completes its journey undisturbed, the level of honey increases
-   Max of 5 levels of honey
-   Level 5 is quite...sticky
-   Bees use nests and hives to share flower locations with other bees
-   Sometimes bees that already know about a flower will choose not to use this information
-   Bee Hives are crafted by players using honeycomb and wood planks
-   Use a silk touch tool to get the block with the bees stored inside
-   Bee Nests will be destroyed unless you use silk touch
-   Use shears when at full honey to get honeycomb
-   Use a bottle when at full honey to get a honey bottle
-   Campfire smoke calms bees - place one underneath the nest / hive to keep them in chill mode
-   Redstone-friendly!
-   Bees like Bee Nests and Bee Hives the same amount! They don't play favorites :)
-   Added the Honey Bottle!

# HONEY BOTTLE

Organic, gluten-free, delicious locally-farmed honey!

-   Use an empty glass bottle on a hive or nest that is full of honey to get a bottle of honey!
-   Drink it!
-   ???
-   Profit!
-   Oh yeah, also craft it into sugar!
-   Added Honeycomb!

# HONEYCOMB

Disclaimer: Cannot be used to comb your hair

-   Shear a full-honey hive or nest to obtain
-   Craft with wood planks to create a Bee Hive

# DISPENSER

-   Dispensers can now fill bottles with water and honey
-   Dispensers can now shear honey combs from Bee Nests and Hives

# NEW LOOT TABLE FUNCTION
