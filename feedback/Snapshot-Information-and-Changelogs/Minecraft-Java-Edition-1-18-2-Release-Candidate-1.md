We’re now releasing the first (and hopefully only) release candidate for Minecraft 1.18.2. This release candidate fixes two world generation bugs that could cause a server to stop running. If there are no major issues following this release, no further changes will be done before the full release, which is planned for February 28th.\

Happy mining!

# FIXED BUGS IN 1.18.2 RELEASE CANDIDATE 1

- [MC-244682](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-244682) - Some custom dimensions settings can cause the server to stop running, but not crash
- [MC-248764](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-248764) - Some worldgen datapacks can kill the internal server (possibly related to density functions)
