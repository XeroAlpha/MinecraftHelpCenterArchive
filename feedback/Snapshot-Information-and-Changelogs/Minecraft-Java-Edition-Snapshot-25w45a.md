Greetings from the Tuesday snapshot shipping room! Our final set of features for Mounts of Mayhem brings the game's strongest armor tier to your favorite mount – with Netherite horse armor! As well as making your steed more stylish, Netherite horse armor will also make them sturdier, perfect for all those mounted challenges. On the submerged side of things, explorers of warmer waters can now swim-ble upon a rare variant of the zombie nautilus.

With this week's snapshot, we're also introducing a new concept for data packs called timelines, that can modify game behavior based on the in-game day time – more about that in the full changelog below.

Happy mining!

## New Features

- Updated the panorama for the Mounts of Mayhem drop
- Added Netherite Horse Armor that can be obtained by upgrading Diamond Horse Armor with a Smithing Table

### Spear Weapon

- Spears are now less forgiving if you miss a charge attack

### Coral Zombie Nautilus

- Added a new variant of the Zombie Nautilus mob: the Coral Zombie Nautilus
- It Spawns in Warm Oceans, replacing the normal Zombie Nautilus

### Camel Husk

- Drops 2-3 Rotten Flesh when killed, with extra 0-1 for each level of Looting

### Advancements

- Added the "Mob Kabob" advancement for spearing 5 enemies with a Charge attack

## Changes

- Zombie Horses, Camel Husks and Nautili become persistent with any interaction from a player, not just riding them
- Video memory impact of anisotropic filtering was reduced, but still remains quite high
- The color of the sky during sunrises and sunsets is now affected by rain and thunder

## Technical Changes

- The Data Pack version is now 93.0
- The Resource Pack version is now 73.0

## Data Pack Version 93.0

- Added new Coral Zombie Nautilus mob variant
  - The Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven
- Item textures were split out of the blocks atlas into a separate new items atlas
  - It means that the commands that were referencing the blocks atlas for item textures now need to reference the items atlas instead

### Zombie Nautilus Variants

- Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven by adding entries to data/\<namespace\>/zombie_nautilus_variant/\<id\>.json
- This feature is experimental
- Fields in file:
  - model - one of: normal, warm
  - asset_id - namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to assets/\<namespace\>/textures/\<path\>.png
  - spawn_conditions - a uniform variant selection rule explained below

#### Spawn conditions

##### minecraft:biome

- Checks if entity is spawning in specific biomes
- Fields:
  - biomes - single entry, list or a tag describing biomes

##### minecraft:moon_brightness

- Checks if current moon brightness is within certain range
- Fields:
  - range - floating point range (a single number or an object like {"min": 1, "max": 2})

##### minecraft:structures

- Checks if entity is spawning in specific structures
- Fields:
  - structures - single entry, list or a tag describing structures

### Game Rules

- The limit for the minecraft:max_entity_cramming game rule has been changed to a minimum of 0

### Data Components

- minecraft:piercing_weapon and minecraft:kinetic_weapon data components now have bounds on their reach parameters:
  - min_reach: is now valid from 0.0 to 128.0
  - max_reach: is now valid from 0.0 to 128.0
  - hitbox_margin: is now valid from 0.0 to 1.0

### Timelines

Timelines are a new experimental concept defined in data packs under the timeline registry (i.e. found under data/\<namespace\>/timeline/\<id\>.json).

Timelines specify game behavior based on the absolute day time (that which is set by /time set). Timelines optionally can specify a period over which they will be repeated.

Primarily, Timelines are able to modify game behavior or visuals by acting as an Environment Attribute source to apply Environment Attribute modifiers.

Format: object with fields

- period_ticks: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat
  - If not specified, the timeline will not repeat
- tracks: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object
  - See the section on Environment Attributes below for details

Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension - see the Dimension Types section below.

With the inclusion of Timelines, Environment Attribute sources are processed in the following order (from low to high priority):

- Dimensions
- Biomes
- Timelines
- Weather (not data-driven)

#### Interpolation

Timelines can define Attribute Tracks - these specify how a modifier for a particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes. Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe. If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be selected.

For example, a Timeline with a period of 24000 might be set up as following:

- At time = 0, the timeline provides sky_color = \#ff0000 (red)
- At time = 1000, the timeline provides sky_color = \#ff0000 (red)
- At time = 6000, the timeline provides sky_color = \#ff00ff (magenta)

Between time = 0 and time = 1000, the sky color will be red. Between 1000 and 6000, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from 6000 all the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = 0 again, the color will slowly shift back to red.

Note: unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override, interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final modified values.

#### Attribute Tracks

An Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object with the following fields:

- ease - optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolation of the value between keyframes
  - Default: linear
  - If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect
- keyframes - list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the ticks field:
  - ticks - integer between 0 and period_ticks (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe's value will be active
  - value - the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier)
    - If no modifier is specified (or override is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself
    - How this value is used depends on the type of modifier
  - Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition
- modifier - optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below)
  - Default: override

For example, the following Timeline has a period of 24000, and has an attribute track that modifies only minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance. Because the easing is constant, between tick 362 and 23667 the value is 0.0, while between tick 23667 and 362 it is 0.7.

Like other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the argument to the specified modifier. This is then applied on top of sources with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is maximum, so this timeline will only ever increase the value of cat_waking_up_gift_chance to the value specified in the track.

    {
        "period_ticks": 24000,
        "tracks": {
            "minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance": {
                "ease": "constant",
                "modifier": "maximum",
                "keyframes": [
                    { "ticks": 362,   "value": 0.0 },
                    { "ticks": 23667, "value": 0.7 }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

###### Easing Types

Easing Types control the interpolation between two keyframes by applying a curve. The following built-in Easing Types are provided:

- constant - always selects the previous keyframe
- linear
- in_back
- in_bounce
- in_circ
- in_cubic
- in_elastic
- in_expo
- in_quad
- in_quart
- in_quint
- in_sine
- in_out_back
- in_out_bounce
- in_out_circ
- in_out_cubic
- in_out_elastic
- in_out_expo
- in_out_quad
- in_out_quart
- in_out_quint
- in_out_sine
- out_back
- out_bounce
- out_circ
- out_cubic
- out_elastic
- out_expo
- out_quad
- out_quart
- out_quint
- out_sine

An Easing Type may also be specified with a Cubic Bézier in the format: { "cubic_bezier": \[ x1, y1, x2, y2 \] }

- x1: float between 0 and 1, x-coordinate of the first control point
- y1: float, y-coordinate of the first control point
- x2: float between 0 and 1, x-coordinate of the second control point
- y2: float, y-coordinate of the second control point

> **Developer's Note**: *To play around with and visualize easings, [easings.net](https://easings.net/) and [cubic-bezier.com](https://cubic-bezier.com/) are great references!*
