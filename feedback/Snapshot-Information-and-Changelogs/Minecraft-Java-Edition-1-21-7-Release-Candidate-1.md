Today we are shipping Release Candidate 1 for 1.21.7, a hotfix release that takes care of some critical issues that managed to sneak their way into the Chase the Skies drop (1.21.6). The hotfix also includes a new music disc and a painting of the good boy Dennis. If no other critical issues are found, this will be the version for 1.21.7 that can be expected to be released soon. Happy mining!

## New Features

- Added a painting of a good boy by artist Sarah Boeving
- Added music disc "Lava Chicken" by Hyper Potions
  - Drops when defeating a Baby Zombie riding a Chicken (Chicken Jockey)
