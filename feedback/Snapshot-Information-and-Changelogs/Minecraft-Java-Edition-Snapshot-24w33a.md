We know you have been waiting long for the next update, and we are finally kicking off the new snapshot cycle with Snapshot 24w33a!

Over the summer someone changed our password and wouldn't let us know what it was until we finished 200 bug fixes (the password was cubepork14 by the way). This update also features a Bundle of new Experiments that we are eager for you to try out!

Enable the new experimental features in the Experiments menu when creating a new world and let us know what you think!

Read below for a full list of the changes included.

Your thoughts on the game continue to shape new updates so please upvote and report any new bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/) and leave us your feedback at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net/).

## Experimental Features

The following changes only apply when their respective Experiment is turned on, either by activating the corresponding experimental data pack or by turning it on in the Experiments screen while creating the world.

These experiments have no effect unless enabled. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

### Bundles

Bundles are back The Bundle was added to Java Edition as an experiment in 2020. We are now working on Bundles again! To test Bundles you must create a new world with the Bundles experiment turned on. (When creating a new world click ‘More’, then ‘Experiments’, then click the button next to the word ‘Bundles’.) A Bundle is an item that lets you stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot. Different items normally don’t stack together, so you can end up wasting space by only having a few items in each slot. A Bundle lets you pack those items together so there is no wasted space.

![bundle_before_after_image.jpg](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/29296154578061)

The Bundle has a tooltip that shows some of the items inside. If the Bundle has up to 8 item types, you will see all of them and can pull any item out immediately. If there are more than 8 item types then some rows of items will be hidden. You may want to craft a new Bundle to keep everything easy to reach. A Bundle can be crafted with 1 String and 1 Leather. Please try out this all-new version of the Bundle and let us know what you think!

- A Bundle only fits one stack (usually 64 items) but it can be a mixture of many different item types
- You can insert items into a Bundle directly in the inventory
- Bundles have a tooltip that shows the items inside
  - If a Bundle has less than 8 item types inside, the tooltip will show all of them
  - Otherwise the tooltip will show the top two rows of items and the others will be hidden below
- You can select any of the visible items to pull out of the Bundle
  - Right-click to take the first item
  - Use the number keys or scroll wheel to select a different item, then right-click to take it

> **Developer's Note:** *In the original Bundle experiment you could only pick the top item. We got a lot of feedback that players wanted more flexibility when taking items out. To address this we put a submenu inside the Bundle, which has never been done before in Minecraft!*

- When selecting an item to remove, the Bundle icon shows that item poking out of the Bundle
- When holding a Bundle in hand, you can empty it onto the ground by right-clicking
- The Bundle is crafted with one String above one Leather

> **Developer's Note:** *The original prototype for Bundles was much more expensive to craft and used Rabbit Hide which is only available in certain biomes, so the player had to explore to get their first Bundle. In this version we’ve made it cheaper and something that you can craft at home in almost any biome. We want it to be easy to get Bundles in a new world so you can use it in your early adventures.*

- The controls have changed from the original prototype:
  - Use left-click to put an item into a Bundle
  - Use right-click to remove the top item type from a Bundle
  - When the Bundle tooltip is visible, use number keys or the mouse wheel to select a different item type then use right-click to remove it

### Redstone Experiments

Added a new Experiment containing various Redstone-related changes. This can be enabled by selecting "Redstone Experiments" in the Experiments menu when creating a world.

Please note that the experimental features behind this toggle are not aimed at any future release at this time. Instead, this is a place for us to try out changes and gather feedback.  
We are excited to hear what you think about these changes: please share your feedback on the [feedpack page](https://aka.ms/fbredstone).

#### Redstone Wire

- The performance impact of Redstone wire (connected blocks of Redstone Dust) has been improved
- Redstone wire now only triggers block updates on blocks that may receive power from the wire
- Before a line of wire causes block updates, the new signal strength of all connected wires is set
- The update order around Redstone wire has been changed
  - The aim is to make wire work the same, independent of position and orientation
  - When possible the order is deterministic based on the context the updates are caused in
  - When there is not enough context to fully determine the order, the rest is picked at random

> **Developer's Note:** *We know that randomness in Redstone is usually unwanted.  
> We've used it here because we've made things deterministic whenever it makes sense, and sometimes it just doesn't make sense - and we don't want some hidden state (like location-based hashes!) determining the order and making machines work differently at different coordinates or in different orientations.  
> The screenshot below shows an example of a 'random' vs 'non-random' wire - we think it's actually pretty logical, and is within the players control to build machines that behave deterministically.  
> But we are looking forward to hearing what you think after trying it out!*

### ![redstone.jpg](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/29296177312653)

### Order in Which a Line of Wire Changes

- When a line of wire turns on, the wires closer to the power source will cause block updates first
- When a line of wire turns off, the wires closer to where the power source was, will cause block updates first
- When two wires have the same distance to the power source, which of them causes updates first is picked at random
  - The random choice is made once for the entire line of wire, to limit the amount of possible outcomes
  - This means, when powering a line of wire from the side, it randomly chooses one of two possible update orders
  - The advantage of having few possible update orders is that the results are more predictable

### Block Updates Around a Wire

- The order in which blocks around the wire update is based on the direction the wire received an update from
- Currently, the order is: back, front, left, right, down, up
  - left and right may be swapped, depending on the random choice made by the line of wire
- When the updates are further distributed through solid blocks, the same order is applied there

#### Known Issues

As this experiment only changes Redstone wire, interactions with other components may not always act as expected, especially when it comes to update orders.

### Minecart Improvements

Added a new Experiment containing various movement changes to Minecarts. This can be enabled by selecting "Minecart Improvements" in the Experiments menu when creating a world.

Our long term goal is to make vehicle travel, like minecarts, a viable option for players compared to other late-game options which currently dominate most playstyles. To achieve this, we aim to make riding minecarts a smooth experience, with consistent and predictable motion and rotation. With this feature toggle we are laying a foundation to build upon in the future. We are aware of that these changes will break some existing contraptions, which is why we want to collaborate with the community to shape the upgrade and future experience of riding minecarts.

Please note that the experimental features behind this toggle are not aimed at any future release at this time. Instead, this is a place for us to try out changes and gather feedback.

We are excited to hear what you think about these changes: please share your feedback on this [feedback page](https://aka.ms/fbcarts).

#### Movement Changes

- Minecarts will articulate their movement better when going fast, riding on the rail all the time
  - Minecarts will now smoothly turn along with the track and are less likely to halt or derail
- Minecarts can now jump better
  - They keep their vertical momentum when the track ends with a slope
  - Minecarts will tilt to visually articulate while in the air
  - No rail grinding sound is played when Minecarts are flying through the air
- Added a new accessibility setting that makes players follow the rotation of Minecarts they ride
  - Defaults to off
  - Only has effect when within a world with the experiment enabled
- Added new gamerule minecartMaxSpeed that changes the maximum speed of Minecarts
  - Defaults to 8 and goes up to 1000 blocks per second.
  - Setting it to a specific value does not guarantee that a minecart will reach that particular max speed - there are built in air resistances and similar effects that the speed added through slopes or powered rails need to overcome
  - This gamerule only exists in worlds with the experiment enabled

#### Minecart Changes

- Minecarts can no longer be placed within another Minecart by the player or a dispenser
- Minecarts can now consistently be placed next to each other along a track
- Minecarts now pick up mobs more consistently when moving along a track

#### Known Impact

- We are aware that these changes will make certain contraptions such as 'piston bolts' not work at all, or have their behavior changed
- Very delicate rail networks will have their timings changed due to slight changes in speeds, movement distance, friction etc.
- Contraptions that rely on Minecarts snapping to rails will no longer work, or have their behavior changed

## Changes

- Various items and blocks have had their assigned rarities changed
- Tweaked portal cooldowns of vehicles and projectiles
  - After using a Nether Portal, Minecarts and Boats now only need to leave the portal for 0.5 seconds to use a portal again (down from previous 15 seconds)
  - After using a Nether Portal, projectiles such as Enderpearls and Arrows now only need to leave the portal for 2 ticks to use a portal again (down from previous 15 seconds)
- Suspicious Stew recipes are now shown in the recipe book
- Breeze no longer have a minimum distance required to attack a target
- Added a new death message for when killed by a Mace smash attack
- Wolves can now also be fed cod, cooked cod, salmon, cooked salmon, tropical fish, pufferfish and rabbit stew to achieve parity with Bedrock
- Enchanted shields now have the same reduced glint as enchanted armor
- Banner Pattern items have new names and icons
- Smithing Template items are now named after their template type instead of the generic "Smithing Template" name
  - They instead specify that they are a Smithing Template through a subtitle in the hover text
- The game will now limit the maximum framerate when it is minimized or when the player is AFK
  - A new Video Setting is introduced to configure this behavior
- Added language support for Tzotzil and Belarusian (Latin)
- Tweaked Bee flight distances and cooldowns
  - Bees now wander around randomly for less time after exiting a nest/hive
  - If a bee has a known nest/hive, it will travel less far from it, thus being less likely to get lost
  - Significantly increased the amount of time a Bee can take to return to a known nest/hive before it gives up trying to return home
  - Bees are now a lot less likely to get stuck on corners or when they are close to a nest/hive they are trying to return to
  - Bees are also now a lot less likely to try and pathfind to a flower it cannot reach
- Updated the Bundle
- Bats can now spawn at any height, not just below sea level, as long as it is dark enough and there is a solid block to spawn on
- A triggered raid will no longer start if the raiders cannot find a place to spawn within a reasonable distance of the village they are trying to raid
- Added baby versions of Dolphins, Squids, and Glow Squids
- Added small and large Salmon variants
- The title specified in the written_book_content component will now be prioritized over custom_name and item_name for any item with a non-empty title in this component
- The performance of the server (tick rate) has been improved when using higher render distances
  - Furthermore, the impact of loading and generating chunks on tick rate has been reduced
- Redstone Torches have been given a new look with updated textures and models, to give it a unique and distinctive identity

### Banner Patterns

- Each Banner Pattern item now includes their pattern type in their name instead of as a subtitle
  - Unique item textures have been added to better distinguish each pattern type
- The following Banner Patterns have been added to achieve parity with Bedrock:
  - Field Masoned
    - Crafted with Paper and Bricks
  - Bordure Indented
    - Crafted with Paper and Vines
- The Bricks and Curved Border patterns in the Loom can no longer be accessed without the above Banner Patterns

### Rarity

- Rarity is a set of categories which determine the color used to display the name of an item or block
  - It has no gameplay impact, but is used to signal how difficult something is to obtain
  - By default, unless specified otherwise, all items and blocks have a rarity of Common which displays their name in the color white
- We have re-evaluated the rarity of all items and blocks in the game to more accurately reflect the current challenge of obtaining them, given the following guidelines:
  - Items and blocks become more rare depending on the following factors:
    - The chance of finding it in a loot table, including mob drops
    - The amount of travelling required to obtain it
    - The difficulty of any obstacle which must be overcome to obtain it
    - The possible amount of that item or block which exists in the world
  - Any item or block which can be crafted must inherit the highest rarity of its crafting ingredients
    - For example, a Mace has an Epic rarity because one of its ingredients (the Heavy Core) has an Epic rarity
    - Likewise, any crafted item which has only Common crafting ingredients must also be Common
- The lists below detail the items and blocks which have changed to that rarity category

#### Common

- End Crystal
- Golden Apple

#### Uncommon

- Sniffer Egg
- Chainmail Helmet
- Chainmail Chestplate
- Chainmail Leggings
- Chainmail Boots
- Recovery Compass
- Disc Fragment 5

- Flow Armor Trim
- Bolt Armor Trim
- The following Music Discs:
  - 13
  - Cat
  - Blocks
  - Chirp
  - Creator (Music Box)
  - Far
  - Mall
  - Mellohi
  - Stal
  - Strad
  - Ward
  - 11
  - Wait
  - Relic
  - 5
  - Precipice

#### Rare

- Enchanted Golden Apple
  - Enchanted Golden Apples have become more common in recent years due to being accessible in both Ancient Cities and Trial Chambers, warranting a demotion to Rare instead of Epic
- Trident
  - We recently increased Trident's rarity up to Epic from Common, but after re-evaluating we felt that it was easier to obtain than other items in the Epic category such as Heavy Cores or Elytras
- Nether Star
- Ward Armor Trim
- Eye Armor Trim
- Vex Armor Trim
- Spire Armor Trim
- Wither Skeleton Skull
- Skull Charge Banner Pattern
  - Now that Wither Skeleton Skulls are Rare, these banner patterns should be Rare as well
- Thing Banner Pattern
  - Now that Enchanted Golden Apples are Rare, these banner patterns should be Rare as well
- The following Music Discs:
  - Pigstep
  - otherside
  - Creator

#### Epic

- Elytra
- Dragon Head
- Silence Armor Trim

### Inactivity FPS limit

- The game will now limit the maximum framerate in certain situations
- These situations are controlled by a new Video Setting: Reduce FPS when
- Possible options are:
  - Mimimized
    - Limits framerate to 10 FPS only when the game window is minimized
  - AFK
    - Limits framerate to 30 FPS when the game is not getting any player input for more than a minute
    - Further limits to 10 FPS after 9 more minutes of no input
    - Also limits to 10 FPS when the game window is minimized
- The default is AFK

### Player Safety

#### Skin Reporting

- Added reporting reason "Sexually inappropriate"
  - This is intended for skins that are graphic in nature relating to sexual acts, sexual organs, and sexual violence
- Removed reason "Defamation" due to lack of relevance for skins
- Removed reason "Threat of harm to others" due to already being covered by "Harassment or bullying" reporting reason

#### Name Reporting

- Added a text label above the description box to clarify that only the name of the player is subject to the report

#### Realms

- Extended the text-filtering-config in order to support an internal migration for Realms Profanity Filtering
  - Servers currently utilizing the text-filtering-config will be able to continue to do so without any changes

### Trial Chambers

- Added new variations to the hallways, including "Encounters": Short challenges leading to a larger chamber.
- Beds in intersections now have their colors randomized.
- Replaced the empty chests at the entrance of chamber with a Hopper and Barrel to better show the players that these are meant for disposal and inventory managment!

## Technical Changes

- The Data Pack version is now 49
- Resource Pack version is now 35
- Added some information about data pack structure (for example, data-driven registries) to generated reports
- Added unique block sounds to the Monster Spawner block
- New server.properties option: pause-when-empty-seconds (default 60)

- Removed server.properties options: spawn-animals and spawn-npcs

### Network Protocol

- Added minecraft:client_tick_end serverbound packet during play phase, sent when the client finishes processing its current tick
  - This is unused by the Vanilla server, but left for use by custom server implementations
- Added ability for custom servers to override the order that players appear in the 'tab list'
  - This is controlled by a non-negative ordering index that is sorted highest to lowest
- The client now shares the state of the 'Particles' limiter option to be used by custom servers

## Data Pack Version 49

- Goat Horn instruments are now data-driven
- Sheep shearing is now controlled by loot tables found as shearing/sheep/\<color\>
- Mooshroom shearing is now controlled by loot tables found as shearing/mooshroom/\<variant\>
- Snow golem shearing is now controlled by a loot table found as shearing/snow_golem
- The crafting_special_suspiciousstew recipe type has been removed
- Added new fields to painting variant definitions
- Added optional field explosion_power to tnt and tnt_minecart types
  - Defaults to 4
  - For TNT minecarts, field value is added to speed-based explosion power
- Added support for Enchantment trigger projectile_spawned in the following items:
  - Snowballs

- Added tempt_range attribute - can be used to change the range, in blocks, at which temptable mobs can be tempted

### Instruments

Goat Horn instruments are now defined in a data pack registry folder called instruments. Like other registries, changing this content in data packs is considered experimental and requires a full world re-load to take effect.

Fields:

- sound_event: The sound event the instrument plays
- range: The maximum range (in blocks) at which the sound can be heard
- use_duration: The amount of time (in seconds) the instrument is considered in use after triggering, which also serves as its cooldown
- description: A Text Component used as the descrpition of the instrument in item tooltips

### Painting variant

- Added new optional fields author and title, holding text components to be displayed in the creative menu tooltip
- This replaces previous mechanism where those values were derived from variant name
- Author tooltip has been removed for earth, wind, fire, water and wither variants

### Tags

#### Item Tags

- furnace_minecart_fuel: Items that can be used to refuel furnace minecart
- villager_picks_up: Items that a Villager will try to pick up from the ground
- Added new tags to control which items can be used to craft and repair various tool sets:
  - wooden_tool_materials
  - iron_tool_materials
  - gold_tool_materials
  - diamond_tool_materials
  - netherite_tool_materials

### New Item Components

#### minecraft:repairable

- If present, and this item is damageable, this item can be repaired in an Anvil using the specified ingredient
- Format: object with fields
  - items: Item, list of Items, or hash-prefixed Item Tag matching what can be used to repair this item
  - e.g. repairable={items:'stick'}

#### minecraft:enchantable

- If present (and any enchantments are applicable), this item can be enchanted in an Enchanting Table
- Format: object with fields
  - value: Positive integer, a higher value allows enchantments with a higher cost to be picked
  - e.g. enchantable={value:15}

### Recipes

The format used for recipe ingredients has been simplified and aligned with other fields that accept item lists (like item predicates):

- For items: { "item": "\<item id\>" } now becomes "\<item id\>"
- For tags: { "tag": "\<tag id\>" } now becomes "#\<tag id\>"
- Lists of items are still allowed, but tags can no longer appear in such list
- Remaining restrictions:
  - minecraft:air can't appear anywhere in ingredient
  - ingredient must have at least one tag or item
- Fields template, base and addition in smithing_transform and smithing_trim recipes are now optional instead of accepting empty list

## Resource Pack Version 35

- Added break, fall, hit, place, and step sounds for the Spawner block
- Removals and renames of some translations is now automatically applied at startup
- Updated the format of post-processing effect definitions
- Added support for emissive layers for block models
- The texture map for the Arrow and Bee Stinger models have been updated
- The model and UV mapping of the Dragon Egg have been updated
- Updated textures, models and sounds for the Bundle item
  - Bundle icon has new models and textures
  - The Bundle UI has new textures and scaling
  - Added a new sound for when failing to add an item to a Bundle
- The models and UV mapping related to the Torch and blocks containing Redstone Torch have been updated
- Added new models for the Redstone Torch and updated its texture

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

- The format of post-processing effect configurations have been updated
- The ChunkOffset uniform in terrain shaders has been renamed to ModelOffset

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

- intarget and auxtargets have been merged into a single inputs list, as specified by the input format below
- outtarget has been renamed to output with the same format
- targets is now a map between target name and target definition, as opposed to a list
  - Inline target names are replaced with an empty object
    - For example, \["swap"\] becomes {"swap": {}}
  - Target definitions with a specific size remain the same, with the name field moved into the map key
    - For example, \[{"name": "potato", "width": 16, "height": 16}\] becomes {"potato": {"width": 16, "height": 16}}

### Input Format

For both render target and texture inputs, the following fields may be specified:

- sampler_name: string - prefix to set up both \_Sampler and \_Size uniforms
  - For example, "sampler_name": "Diffuse" will link to the DiffuseSampler and DiffuseSize uniforms
  - This was previously always DiffuseSampler and InSize for intarget
  - For auxtargets, the name defined the sampler uniform, and the size was given as AuxSize\<index\>
- bilinear: boolean (default: false) - if true, the input will be sampled with a bilinear filter
  - This formerly only existed on texture inputs, however now functions for render targets
  - For render targets, replaces the now removed use_linear_filter field on the pass definition

For inputs from a render target, the following fields may be specified:

- target: namespaced id - the render target id
  - Either a custom target id defined in the same file, or minecraft:main to reference the main screen target
  - This replaces the former id field, which was a free-form string
- use_depth_buffer: boolean (default: false) - true to sample from the depth texture, false to sample from the color texture
  - This replaces the former :depth suffix applied to the target id

For inputs from a static texture, the following fields may be specified:

- location: namespaced string - the location to a static texture file that can be sampled by the effect
  - As the id field did before, this resolves to a texture at assets/\<namespace\>/textures/effect/\<path\>.png
- width: positive integer - width in pixels of the texture
- height: positive integer - height in pixels of the texture

### External Targets

- The 'Fabulous' graphics transparency post-processing config no longer specifies the sorted framebuffers as custom targets
  - These are instead imported in the same way as the minecraft:main target
  - translucent, itemEntity, particles, weather, clouds are now minecraft:translucent, minecraft:item_entity, minecraft:particles, minecraft:weather, and minecraft:clouds respectively
- The entity outline processing shader similarly imports the minecraft:entity_outline target

## Translation removals and renames

- During load some deprecated translation strings will now be removed and/or renamed
- Packs that used those translations will need to re-add them manually
- The full list is available in /assets/minecraft/lang/deprecated.json file inside the game's JAR file

## Emissive layers for block models

- Added an optional light_emission field to block model elements
- Integer value between 0 and 15, with 0 being the default value (no light emission)
- If specified and non-zero, this will behave as the minimum light level that the element can receive
