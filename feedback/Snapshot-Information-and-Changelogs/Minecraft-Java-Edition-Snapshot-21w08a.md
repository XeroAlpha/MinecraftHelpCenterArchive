In this snapshot, our new beloved stone type has suffered a grim fate and has been renamed \"Deepslate\". How mysterious!

-   Tweaked cave sizes further
-   Canyon and cave carvers now apply below y=0
-   Cracks can now be found carved into the ground
-   Grimstone has been changed into Deepslate
-   Added Deepslate ores
-   The [distribution of ores](https://images.ctfassets.net/8y6ykjruobr4/73xBtA88xuZQ3fKYH3pX6G/83cc7b912a6c08097d1e7e96e7ed6e96/snapshot-21w08a-ore-distribution.jpg) has been further tweaked
-   Andesite no longer generates under y=0
-   Tuff now sometimes generates under y=0
-   The Tuff layer of amethyst geodes has been replaced with now a new type of stone called Smooth Basalt
-   Smooth Basalt is now obtained from smelting Basalt
-   Another round of tweaking has been done to the new textures of ores and Blackstone
-   Emerald and Lapis Lazuli ore textures have had some touch-ups
-   Mineshafts now once again generate in the open air in caves
-   Particles now appear in the air around spore blossoms

## DEEPSLATE

-   Grimstone is now called Deepslate
-   Deepslate now has a top texture, and a new block called Cobbled Deepslate drops from Deepslate
-   The cobbled variant is the same but without the top texture, and is used to craft all Deepslate variants instead
-   Deepslate now has a unique set of sounds! Very crunchy indeed

## DEEPSLATE ORES

-   Added Deepslate versions of Iron, Gold, Lapis, Redstone, and Diamond ores that generate wherever those ores replace Deepslate
-   Twice as tough to mine as normal ores
