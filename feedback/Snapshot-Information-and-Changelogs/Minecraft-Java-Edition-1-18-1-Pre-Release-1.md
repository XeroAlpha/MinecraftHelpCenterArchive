We're now releasing the first pre-release for Minecraft 1.18.1. This will be a fairly small release that will fix a few stability issues and a few bugs. We aim to release this version at the end of next week.

Happy mining!

# TECHNICAL CHANGES IN 1.18.1 PRE-RELEASE 1

- Fixed an issue that would cause players on low-bandwidth connections to get timeout errors when connecting to a server
- World fog now starts further away from the player, to make distant terrain more visible
- Instead of applying fog as a spherical volume it is now applied as a cylindrical volume

# FIXED BUGS IN 1.18.1 PRE-RELEASE 1

- [MC-219507](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-219507) - Beacon’s power reverts back to previous one on world reload
- [MC-242729](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-242729) - Observer activating without any updates nearby, caused by /clone
