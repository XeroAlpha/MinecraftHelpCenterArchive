**ENCHANTMENTS**

**PIERCING (I, II, III, IV)**

-   With this pointy enchantment, arrows shot from your crossbow can travel through mobs, hitting more than one per shot
-   The number of mobs that can be damaged by a single arrow is equal to the level of this enchantment + 1
-   Cannot be combined with Multishot

**QUICK CHARGE (I, II, III)**

-   Each level of quick charge decreases the amount of time it takes to fully charge your crossbow by .25 seconds

**LOADING MECHANICS**

    -   List operations: insert before index \|insert after index\|prepend\|append

    -   Object operations: merge

    -   Sources:

    -   -   from \<block or entity\> \<path\> - copies value from existing tag
        -   value \<nbt\> - uses NBT literal

**DROP**

**Sources**

\- \`award\` - uses advancement award context

\- \`fish\` - uses fishing context

\- \`loot\` - uses loot chest context

\- \`kill\` - simulates entity drops

\- \`mine\` - simulates block drops

**NBT PATHS**

-   Can now return multiple values. When used as target, modification will be applied to every element

-   -   For example writing to Items\[{Slot:10b}\] will either found element in Items for slot 10 or create new one

-   Add \[{k1=v1,k2=v2}\] to match objects in list that have matching fields

-   Add {k1=v1,k2=v2} to match objects (selects 0 or 1 elements, mostly as safeguard against mismatched entries)

-   Allow negative indices in \[index\] to select element from end (i.e. \[-1\] is last element, \[-2\] second to last, etc)

-   Add \[\] to select all elements from list

-   Loot tables have optional type, used to validate function usage (available types: empty, chest, fishing, entity, advancement_reward, block). Using function that references data not available in given context (for example, block state in fishing table) will cause warning
-   New entity parameter in predicates: direct_killer_entity - allows access to projectiles etc.
