It's Snapshot Tues- I mean Thursday, everyone! Today, we are kicking off a brand-new Snapshot series and with it comes the first set of features from our upcoming game drop, Mounts of Mayhem! Charge into the fray with the spear, a new weapon with a unique enchantment. Explore the oceans atop your nautilus or claim undead mounts – the zombie horse and zombie nautilus – as your new steeds. Galloping side to side with these new features is both a revamped video settings screen that includes nifty new graphical presets, as well as the new stopwatch command which keeps track of real time. Bug fixes and technical changes round off the meal, as is tradition.

 

Happy mining!

## New Features

- Added Nautilus and Zombie Nautilus
- Added Nautilus Armor
- Added Spear Weapon
- Updated advancements to include Nautilus, Zombie Nautilus, and the Zombie Horse

### Nautilus

- Nautilus is a new neutral aquatic mob
- Spawns in all ocean biomes
- Attacks using a Dash attack, if provoked
- Occasionally attacks Pufferfish within range using the Dash attack
- Has a Dash skill similar to Camels, used by pressing the Jump button
- Takes suffocation damage on land
- Adds the "Breath of the Nautilus" effect to mounted players
- Nautilus can be bred and tamed using Pufferfish or a Bucket of Pufferfish
- A Tamed Nautilus:
  - Can be mounted using a Saddle
  - With a Saddle has a roaming restriction of 16 blocks
  - Without a Saddle has a roaming restriction of 32 blocks

#### Zombie Nautilus

- Zombie Nautilus is a new underwater mob that spawns with a Drowned rider wielding a Trident
- Zombie Nautilus is only hostile if ridden by a hostile mob
- Zombie Nautilus behaves similar to the Nautilus except that it cannot be bred

### Nautilus Armor

- Equippable on the Nautilus and Zombie Nautilus
- Comes in Copper, Golden, Iron, Diamond and Netherite versions

### Spear Weapon

- New weapon that can be crafted in Wood, Stone, Copper, Iron, Gold, Diamond and Netherite versions
- Each material has different stats for timing, influencing how fast they are to use
- Has a minimum reach for damage, being too close to a target will yield no damage
- Has extended maximum reach compared to other tools and weapons
- Has two attacks. Jab and Charge
- Zombies, Husks, Zombified Piglins and Piglins can spawn with the Spear

#### Jab Attack

- Quick-press primary action button to use
- Low damage attack with knockback
- Cooldown between attacks
- Wooden Spears have the fastest cooldown; Netherite the slowest
- Can hit multiple enemies
- Does not destroy blocks

#### Charge Attack

- Press and hold the secondary action button to use
- Damage is based on Spear material, the player’s view angle, and the velocity of both the player and the target
- While holding down the button, the attack goes through three stages before returning to idle:
  - Engaged: The Spear can deal damage, knockback, and dismount mounted enemies if the speed is above the required thresholds
  - Tired: Indicated by the Spear rotating to a vertical position and shaking. The Spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds
  - Disengaged: Indicated by the Spear being lowered, pointing downwards. The Spear gives damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required threshold
- The Spear's range when used by mobs is half of that when used by players, but they can deal damage, dismount and knockback at lower speeds than the players
- Zombies, Husks and Zombified Piglins know how to charge with a Spear

#### Lunge Enchantment

- Spear exclusive enchantment
- Only works with the Jab attack
- When doing a Jab attack with Lunge, it propels the player horizontally in the view direction
- The view angle needs to be perfectly leveled horizontally to achieve maximum lunge distance
- Does significant durability damage to the Spear

- The input modfier to change GUI scale in the Video Settings screen
- Stopping the recipe book from cycling through variations of items

### Debug Renderer Changes

- Same as before, do not treat debug renderers as supported features, they are there only to aid with development
- More debug renderers are now available through the Debug Settings screen
- Some existing renderers were improved
- The performance of debug renderers has been significantly improved

### Graphics Presets

- Settings on the Video Settings screen have been reordered and split into 3 sections: "Display", "Quality & Performance", and "Interface"
- The following settings that were duplicating accessibility settings have been removed from the Video Settings screen:
  - "View Bobbing"
  - "Glint Speed"
  - "Glint Strength"
  - "FOV Effects"
  - "Distortion Effects"
- Tweaks that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting have been split out to be configurable independently:
  - "See-Through Leaves"
  - "Show Vignette"
  - "Weather Effect Radius" configures the distance in blocks within which rain and snow are visible
  - "Improved Transparency" resolves some of the transparent geometry rendering issues at a significant GPU cost, previously was hidden behind "Fabulous!"
- A new "Preset" slider was added to the top of the "Quality & Performance" section
  - Presets, as you would expect based on gaming industry standard, control most of the "Quality & Performance" settings at once, not only the ones that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting
  - Available presets are "Fast", "Fancy", "Fabulous!" and "Custom"
  - The default preset is "Fancy" for new players
  - But for players who are upgrading to this version the preset will be set to "Custom" to preserve your current configuration

### UI

- The Resource Pack version is now 70.0
- The Minecraft Server Management Protocol version is now 1.1.0
- Added ClientFps JFR event
- Experience packets that do not change the player's experience progress or level are no longer sent by the server

### Minecraft Server Management Protocol Version 1.1.0

- Added a new notification server/activity
  - Indicates that a network connection to the server has been initiated
  - Rate limited to 1 notification per 30 seconds

## Data Pack Version 89.0

- Added stopwatch command for keeping track of real time

### Commands

#### Added stopwatch

- New command that allows the creation of a Stopwatch that keeps track of real time
- Stopwatches do not depend on game ticks
- They only run when the server/world is running, even when paused

Syntax:

- stopwatch \<id\> create - creates a Stopwatch with the given namespaced ID
- stopwatch \<id\> query - shows the elapsed time in seconds of the given Stopwatch in chat
- stopwatch \<id\> restart - restarts the given Stopwatch
- stopwatch \<id\> remove - removes the given Stopwatch

> **Developer's Note**: *This command is added to replace the need of using world borders to keep track of real time. The intent is to change the world border to be dependent on game ticks in a future snapshot. If you've relied on this way of measuring the passage of real time before, please switch to using the new command and let us know if anything doesn't work as intended. Thank you!*

#### execute

- Added new syntax /execute if\|unless stopwatch \<id\> \<range\>
- Allows to compare the elapsed time of a given Stopwatch with a floating point value range
  - The Stopwatch value is measured in seconds and has an accuracy of at most a millisecond
  - Example: /execute if stopwatch foo:bar ..10 run say Stopwatch foo:bar has not reached 10 seconds yet

### Item Components

#### Added minecraft:use_effects

- Controls how the player behaves when using an item (right mouse click)
- Format: object with fields
  - can_sprint: boolean, whether the player can sprint while using this item
    - Default value: false

#### Added minecraft:damage_type

- Specifies the type of damage this item deals
- Format: string, damage type identifier
  - e.g. damage_type='minecraft:spear'

#### Added minecraft:kinetic_weapon

- Enables a charge-type attack when using the item (primarily for Spears), where, while being used, the damage is dealt along a ray every tick based on the relative speed of the entities

  - min_reach: float, the minimum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid
    - Default value: 0.0

  - max_reach: float, the maximum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid
    - Default value: 3.0

  - hitbox_margin: float, the margin applied to the target bounding box when checking for valid hitbox collision
    - Default value: 0.3

  - delay_ticks: integer, the time in ticks required before weapon is effective
    - Default value: 0

  - dismount_conditions, knockback_conditions, damage_conditions: indicating the condition to apply dismount, knockback and damage effects respectively. Objects with fields:
    - max_duration_ticks: integer, the ticks after which the condition is no longer checked. This starts after delay has elapsed
    - min_speed: float, the minimum speed of the attacker, in blocks per second, along the direction that the attacker is looking
      - Optional, default value: 0.0
    - min_relative_speed: float, the minimum relative speed between the attacker and target, in blocks per second, along the direction that the attacker is looking
      - Optional, default value: 0.0

  - forward_movement: float, the distance the item moves out of hand during animation

    {max_duration:60},knockback_conditions:{max_duration:40},dismount_conditions:{max_duration:20}}
- The damage dealt is calculated as floor(relative_speed \* velocity_multiplier) where relative_speed is the difference of speed vectors of the attacker and the target as projected onto the axis of the attacker's view vector
  - Any additional damage from enchantments or attribute modifiers is added after this calculation

#### Added minecraft:piercing_weapon

- Enables a quick attack that damages multiple entities along a ray (primarily for Spears)

### Damage Types

- Added a new minecraft:spear damage type

### Predicates

#### Component Predicates

- Component predicates (predicates field in block, item and entity predicates) now include predicates for checking existence of every component type
- Those predicates are written as {\<component_type\>: {}}
- Such predicate check passes as long as component is present, no matter the actual value
- Existing predicates for specific components remain unchanged
- Example:
  - {predicates:{written_book_content:{author:"foo"}} - existing format for matching books
  - {predicates:{written_book_content:{}} - special case of above that accepted any value, as long as component existed
  - {predicates:{instrument:{}} - checks if component minecraft:instrument exists (was not allowed before)

#### Entity Predicates

The flags predicate now supports new values:

- is_in_water: when an entity is touching water or a bubble column
- is_fall_flying: when an entity is gliding with an Elytra

#### Item Predicates

- Item predicate in command form (\<item\>\[predicate~{...},component={...}\]) has been extended to accept empty predicates for any component type
- Similarily to component predicates in data, those empty entries only check for component existence
- Existing shorter syntax for checking component existence remains unchanged
  - That means \*\[instrument\] and \*\[instrument~{}\] are equivalent

### Enchantments

#### Enchantment Effect Components

- minecraft:post_piercing_attack: Effects applying after a piercing attack with an item

#### Enchantment Entity Effects

- minecraft:apply_impulse: applies an impulse to the targeted entity
  - direction - The first step of determining the impulse is applying this vector as local coordinates (the same used by tp @s ^ ^ ^) onto the entity look vector
  - coordinate_scale - The second step is scaling the resulting vector by this vector on each axis in world space, X, Y and Z
  - magnitude - The third step is scaling the resulting vector by this Level-Based Value
- minecraft:play_sound: can now support a list of sound event identifiers, one for each level of enchantment. If a level is higher than the number of sounds, the last sound in the list is used

##### Added exponent

- Raises the base to the specified power level.
  - base - Level-Based Value indicating the base of the exponent.
  - power - Level-Based Value indicating the power of the exponent.

## Resource Pack Version 70.0

- Unifont has been updated to 17.0.01

## Textures

- texture section of \*.mcmeta files has a new boolean field darkened_cutout_mipmap
  - The default value is false
  - It is set to true for the block textures that had mipmaps before this version: all Leave types and Mangrove Roots
  - If the field is set to true and the texture is cutout the mipmaps will be darkened to emulate the darker interior of the block, this was the behavior for cutout mipmapped blocks before this version
  - Leaving the field unset or setting it to false will generate mipmaps without darkening, and it fits well for other types of cutout blocks that do not have dark interior such as flowers, grasses, vines, rails, etc
