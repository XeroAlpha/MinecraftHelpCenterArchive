Because it's the month of May, may we tempt you with the first Snapshot for Java Edition 1.21? This one looks as excellent as it sounds, thanks to the 20 new paintings and 3 new music discs it adds to the game. And we're not stopping there, data-driven enchantments are also being thrown into the fray with this Snapshot (hence the 900+ line changelog). We also included a batch of new bug fixes for good measure.

Enchantments can be added in the registry enchantment. All Vanilla Enchantments can be found in the vanilla datapack in the client and server jar files.

Fields:

- description: The name of the Enchantment when displayed in text represented as a Text Component
- exclusive_set: The Enchantment(s) this Enchantment is exclusive with
  - Two Enchantments can never co-exist on an item if either is in the other's exclusive set

  - Positive integer

- effects: A map of effect components, as described below in the Effect Components section

#### LEVEL-BASED VALUES

Many effects of Enchantments depend on the level of the Enchantment. For these fields, a type called Level-Based Values is used. In their most basic form, Level-Based Values can be written as floating-point constants, which is interpreted as a value that isn't in fact level-based, the constant is used as-is for all levels.

If a Level-Based value is not a floating-point constant, it is an object with a type field, specifying one of the following types.

##### linear

The most common type of Level-Based Value is a linear value. A linear Level-Based Value has two fields:

- base: The base value added to all levels
- per_level_above_first: Amount added for each level above the first one

In effect, a linear Level-Based Value results in base + per_level_above_first \* (level - 1).

##### clamped

A Level-Based Value type that clamps a value between a min and max. Fields:

- value: A Level-Based Value used as the input
- min: A floating point value specifying the minimum value of the output
- max: A floating point value specifying the maximum value of the output

##### fraction

A Level-Based Value type that represents the fraction between two values. Fields:

- numerator: A Level-Based Value used as the numerator
- denominator: A Level-Based Value used as the denominator

##### levels_squared

A Level-Based Value type that evaluates to the square of the levels, plus an addition. Fields:

- added: A floating-point value added to the result of the squared levels

In effect, a levels_squared Level-Based Value results in level ^ 2 + added

#### VALUE EFFECT TYPES

Value Effects are effects used to manipulate the amount of *something* in the game.

##### add

A Value Effect that adds a value to the processed results.

Fields:

- value: A Level-Based Value determining how much to add
  - Negative values are supported

##### all_of

A Value Effect that runs a number of other Value Effects, in order. This can be useful when the same set of conditions apply to a number of Value Effects.

Fields:

- effects: A list of the Value Effects to run

##### multiply

A Value Effect that multiplies the processed value by a given factor.

Fields:

- factor: A Level-Based Value determining the factor to multiply in

##### remove_binomial

A Value Effect that runs a Binomial series of checks, reducing the input value by 1 for every successful check.

Fields:

- chance: A Level-Based Value representing the chance that an input value is dropped.
  - The span is 0 to 1, with 0 being no chance to drop an input value and 1 dropping all input values

##### set

A Value Effect that overwrites the input value with a given Level-Based Value.

Fields:

- value: The Level-Based Value to use as the result

#### ATTRIBUTE EFFECTS

Attribute effects use the Attribute system to apply an Attribute Modifier whenever the Enchanted Item is correctly equipped. Attribute effects do not have a dynamic type - they are all the same type.

Fields:

- name: The name of the Attribute Modifier to add
- attribute: The ID of the attribute to modify
- operation: The operation of the Attribute Modifier
  - One of add_value, add_multiplied_base and add_multiplied_total
- amount: A Level-Based Value describing the amount
- uuid: A string containing a UUID for the Attribute Modifier to use
  - Must be unique to avoid different Enchantments (or other systems) interfering with each others

#### ENTITY EFFECT TYPES

Entity Effects are Enchantment effects that generally do something to an Entity involved in an event. Which Entity is affected depends on the specific component being configured.

##### all_of

An Entity Effect that runs a list of other Entity Effects. This can be useful when a set of conditions should apply to more than one Entity Effect.

Fields:

- effects: List of Entity Effects to run

##### apply_mob_effect

An Entity Effect that applies a random Mob Effect to the affected Entity, chosen from a set of options. The duration and amplifier are randomized within a given span. The effect of specifying larger maximum values than the minimum value is undefined.

Fields:

#### LOCATION-BASED EFFECT TYPES

Location-Based Effects are special effects that activate and deactivate depending on where the owner of the Enchanted Item moves. Location-Based Effect only trigger when such items are initially equipped and subsequently when the owning Entity moves to a new space in the Block grid - i.e. when their coordinates change to a new integer value.

All Entity Effect types can also be used as Location-Based Effects, and in addition attribute can be used to specify an Attribute Effect as a location-based effect.

#### EFFECT CONDITIONS

Most Enchantment effects are filtered using Conditions (same types as in loot tables). This enables effects to be specific for different situations. Each Effect Component defines which parameters are available for the condition to evaluate - some parameters are available for all of these parameter sets, while some are specific to a certain set.

Each effect component specifies which parameters are available in the [Effect Components](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w18a#effect-components) list below.

#### EFFECT COMPONENTS

The effects field in an Enchantment is a map of Effect Component type the Effect List data. Most Effect Components are lists, so any number of Effects can be added of any Component Type. The data for each effect generally involves having a specified condition context and Effect Type, but some Effects also deviate from this format.

In cases where the documentation specifies a Condition Context and Effect, the Component is a list. Each entry in the list has a field named effect with the effect of the type used by the list. Entries can also optionally include a field named requirements specifying the condition parameters, which are then evaluated with the documented context.

For example: trades/desert_armorer_helmet_4 and trades/taiga_armorer_chestplate_5.

#### ENCHANTMENT PROVIDER TYPES
