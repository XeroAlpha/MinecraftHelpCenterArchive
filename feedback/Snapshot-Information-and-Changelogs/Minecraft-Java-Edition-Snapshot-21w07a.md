# CHANGES IN 21W07A

- Tweaks and updates to world generation and ores
- Changes to the visuals of some ores and stone types
- Reordered Redstone Tab in Creative Inventory

## WORLD GENERATION

- Tweaked huge caves to be more rare and decreased the chance that caves are filled with water
- Changed ore generation to match the new world height and to add more strategy to mining
- Tweaked size and positioning of diorite, andesite & granite generation
- Exception: Diorite and Granite and Dirt no longer generate below y = 0
- Strongholds are now mostly encased in stone
- Mineshaft corridors are now supported by log pillars below or chains above when needed

## VISUALS

- Ores without unique shapes have been given new textures for accessibility reasons, so that each ore is distinguishable by shape alone
- Being the most iconic ore, Diamond Ore texture is staying the same to keep that classic feel maintained
- Blackstone, Polished Blackstone Bricks, and Cracked Polished Blackstone Bricks have had some minor touch-ups

## CREATIVE INVENTORY

- The Redstone Tab has been reordered to prioritize highly-used blocks
- Redstone items/blocks have been grouped and ordered in the following way:
  - Essentials
  - Unique activators
  - Miscellaneous
  - Common activators
  - Openables
