**Changes in 18W15A**

-   New entity: Dolphins
-   New block: Conduit
-   New block: Blue Ice
-   New item: Heart of the Sea
-   New item: Nautilus Shell
-   Icebergs now generate in frozen oceans
-   You no longer have \"\"night vision\"\" effect underwater
-   Water now has different colours based on the biome
-   New video option: Biome blend distance

\
**Dolphins**\
\
It\'s happening!

-   Spawns in any ocean that isn\'t frozen
-   They\'re just cute, okay?
-   Dolphins are very playful and love floating items
-   They also love to chase after boats
-   If you upset one, you upset them all
-   More behaviours coming soon

\
**Water**\
\

-   Blubb blubb blubb blubb
-   Water now only blocks 1 light per block, instead of 3
-   This only affects newly placed water - we will relight all chunks in an upcoming snapshot
-   Every ocean biome has a unique water colour, and swamps are icky and gross
-   In newly generated chunks, you\'re less likely to find frozen ocean next to warm ocean (and similar)

\
**Conduit**\
\
?????

-   ????
-   I\'m not sure.
-   What is this?
-   Where are we?
