**Dolphins**\
\
It's happening!

- Spawns in any ocean that isn't frozen
- They're just cute, okay?
- Dolphins are very playful and love floating items
- They also love to chase after boats
- If you upset one, you upset them all
- More behaviours coming soon

\
**Water**\
\

- Blubb blubb blubb blubb
- Water now only blocks 1 light per block, instead of 3
- This only affects newly placed water - we will relight all chunks in an upcoming snapshot
- Every ocean biome has a unique water colour, and swamps are icky and gross
- In newly generated chunks, you're less likely to find frozen ocean next to warm ocean (and similar)
