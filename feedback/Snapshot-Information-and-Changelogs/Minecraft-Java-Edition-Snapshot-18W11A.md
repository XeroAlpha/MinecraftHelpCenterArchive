**Changes in 18W11A**

- Added shipwrecks!
- Added a new hostile mob: The Drowned!
- Added coral fans!
- Added F3+C to copy your current location to clipboard

  
**Coral Fans**  
  
We were big fans of coral, so we couldn't resist.

- Doesn't spawn naturally yet
- You can place it on the side of coral!

  
**Drowned**  
  
They're called ""drowned"" for a reason!

- Spawn in all oceans! And rivers too!
- Zombies will also become drowned after, well, drowning
- Drowned can spawn with tridents, allowing you to get them in survival
- Their loot isn't final - there's a super secret item coming soon
- They can swim but they prefer to walk
- Gurgle.
- All drowned have a melee attack, and ones with tridents have a ranged attack
- Like zombies, drowned don't really like turtles that much

  
**Shipwrecks**

- Can be found in oceans and beaches
- Has 3 different type of loot depending on the ship!
- May spawn with some air pockets, that's a known bug. Sorry!
