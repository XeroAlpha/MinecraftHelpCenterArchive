Good things come to those who wait, and we've believe you've waited long enough. The first Caves & Cliffs snapshot is finally here and ready to enter the Java Edition of Minecraft! We hope that you're as excited about this as we are, because this snapshot brings you a variety of features, some changes to existing features, and a few technical changes. All of it is listed in this blog post, and we can't wait to see you experiment with it all.

Happy mining!

# NEW FEATURES IN 20W45A

- Added bundles!
- Added candle!
- Added lava cauldron!
- Added copper!
- Added amethyst!
- Added lightning rod!
- Added spyglass!
- Added tinted glass!
- A shulker hitting a shulker with a shulker bullet can make a new shulker.

## AMETHYST

### AMETHYST BLOCKS

- Amethyst comes in block form inside the geodes in two ways: block of amethyst and budding amethyst.
- All types of Amethyst blocks (clusters included) create beautiful sounds when you walk on them, break them, place them, or hit them with a projectile – go make some music!

### AMETHYST CLUSTERS

- Amethyst clusters grow from budding amethyst, which can be found inside geodes.
- Clusters have four growth stages: small amethyst bud, medium amethyst bud, large amethyst bud, and amethyst cluster.
- Clusters can only grow when they are placed on budding amethyst blocks.
- Fully-grown amethyst clusters drop four amethyst shards (or more with Fortune) when an iron pickaxe or higher is used, and drop nothing otherwise when broken.
- Clusters can be silk touched at any stage.

### AMETHYST GEODES

- These huge geodes can be found anywhere underground in the Overworld.
- Amethyst geodes have an outer layer of a new stone called tuff.
- Amethyst geodes have a second layer of another new block called calcite.
- Amethyst geodes have an inner layer of various amethyst blocks.

### AMETHYST SHARDS

- Amethyst clusters drop four amethyst shards (or more with Fortune).

### BUDDING AMETHYS

- On any side of a budding amethyst block where there is air or a water source block, a small amethyst bud will eventually grow.
- Amethyst Buds can only grow when attached to budding amethyst and will grow until they become amethyst clusters.

## BUNDLES

- Bundles are items that hold other items.
- A bundle can hold a mixture of items, but only one stack’s worth. For example, a bundle could fit:
  - 64 dirt
  - 32 dirt + 32 stone
  - 32 dirt + 8 ender pearls
  - One of every color of wool, concrete, carpet and terracotta (64 blocks in total)
  - Or one diamond helmet
- Use right-click to put an item into a bundle.
- Right-click a bundle to empty it.
- Wrap a present in a bundle and give it to your friend!

## CANDLES

- Candles come in all 16 colors + one uncolored variant.
- Up to four can be placed in one block.
- Candles allow you to properly wish someone a happy birthday.
- Waterloggable! (But you cannot light them underwater, silly).
- Wish anybody a happy birthday with a candle cake!

## CAULDRONS

- Cauldrons can now be filled with buckets of lava!
- Filled lava cauldrons give off a redstone signal of strength 1.

## COPPER

### COPPER BLOCKS

- Craft nine copper ingots to a copper block.
- Craft cut copper, cut copper stairs and cut copper slabs.
- Use honeycomb to craft waxed copper blocks.

### COPPER ORE

- Copper ore can be found in ore blobs across Overworld, similar to iron and coal (this is not the final generation for copper…)
- Smelt copper ore to get a copper ingot.

### LIGHTNING ROD

- The lightning rod is crafted from three copper ingots.
- Keep your builds safe (well, as long as the closest area around the lightning rod is fireproof) during thunderstorms!
- The lightning rod will protect an area of 4 \* 16 blocks around it from the, sometimes devastating, lightning strikes!
- Lightning rods give off a redstone signal when struck by lightning

### OXIDATION

- Copper will oxidize over time
- There are for stages: copper, lightly weathered copper, semi-weathered copper, and weathered copper.
- It takes 50-82 Minecraft days (in loaded chunks) for a copper block to oxidize one stage.
- Waxed copper blocks will not oxidize.
- You can wax any oxidation stage – how lovely that means you can keep that pretty lightly weathered copper block in it’s lightly weathered stage forever!

## SPYGLASS

- You can use your spyglass to see faraway things.
- Pretend to be a sea captain, or catch your neighbor in the act as they dye your sheep lime green.
- The spyglass is crafted from two copper ingots and one amethyst shard.

## TINTED GLASS

- Tinted glass is a type of glass that does not allow light to pass through.
- Tinted glass is crafted by putting a glass block in the middle of four amethyst shards.
- Tinted glass can be obtained without silk touch; it does not shatter like normal glass.

# CHANGES IN 20W45A

- Experience orbs now sometimes merge when in large quantities to improve performance. This does not change the rate at which the player can absorb them – it simply limits the amount of separate orbs floating around in the world. Orbs that merge will gain the lifetime of the most recently created one.
- Particles now appear when pistons break blocks.
- Simple firework rockets with one gunpowder can now be crafted using the recipe book.
- Dirt paths (formerly grass path) can now be made by using a shovel on dirt, podzol, mycelium, or course dirt (as well as grass).
- Minecarts and rails work in water.

## MINECARTS

Minecarts and rails work in water

- All rails can be waterlogged (works with a dispenser & water bucket too).
- Flowing water doesn’t break rails.
- Minecarts can pass through water, but get slowed down more than usual.

# TECHNICAL CHANGES IN 20W45A

- Entities are now saved separately from terrain chunks.
- Added loot table function set_banner_pattern
- Pack format in version.json has been split into data and resource versions
- Servers can now require custom resource packs to be accepted

## CUSTOM SERVER RESOURCE PACKS

A dedicated server can enforce custom resource packs by setting require-resource-pack in server.properties. When this option is used, players will be prompted for a response and will be disconnected if they decline the required pack.

## ENTITY STORAGE

Entities have been extracted from main (terrain) chunks and are now stored in a separate entities directory (similar to POI storage).\
Those new files are still region files with NBT.

## LOOT TABLES

### NEW FUNCTIONS

#### SET_BANNER_PATTERN

Sets tags needed for banner patterns.\
Parameters:

- patterns - list of pattern objects:
  - pattern - name of pattern (square_bottom_left, bricks, etc.)
  - color - name of color (light_gray, etc.)
- append - if true, new elements will be appended to existing ones instead of replacing
