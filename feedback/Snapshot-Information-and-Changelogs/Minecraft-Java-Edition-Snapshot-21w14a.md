A new snapshot is ready to be served, although somewhat… raw. Gordon Ramsey would be furious. Please don’t tell him, we don’t want to be called donuts. :(

Most of us have just gotten back from being off for a few days during Easter, so this snapshot is a bit on the smaller side.

# NEW FEATURES IN 21W14A

- Added Raw Copper, Raw Iron, and Raw Gold items
- Tuff blobs can now be found between heights 0 and 16

## SMELTABLE ORE DROPS

- Ores that are smeltable now drop raw item forms of the ore instead of the ore block and these can be smelted just like before
- This is to prevent cluttering the inventory and have consistency with Fortune on all ores
- Ore blocks from old worlds and silk-touched ore blocks will continue to be smeltable

# CHANGES IN 21W14A

- Fully oxidized Copper can now be waxed
