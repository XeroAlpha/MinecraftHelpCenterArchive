In this week's snapshot we've got a nice quality of life improvement for all the chatters out there. Now your unsent messages will be saved as drafts, check out the details below. Items on shelves will now be positioned in the middle of the shelf as default. Before we move our focus onto technical tweaks and bug fixes for this drop, we have one final feature to announce – and it involves a very cute interaction between the copper golem and the iron golem! With this, all features for our third game drop of 2025 are now in testing, and we'll start working our next game drop, which we are excited to tell you about soon!

## New Features

- Added light flashes to The End dimension as part of the ongoing Vibrant Visuals work
- Iron Golems will sometimes plant a decorative flower onto a nearby Copper Golem
- Unsent chat messages now get saved as chat drafts

### The End Light Flashes

- The End dimension now has skylight
- Normally the skylight does not affect how the dimension looks
- From time to time flashes in the sky happen
- When they happen skylight intensity increases flooding the dimension with purple light

### Copper Golem

- Iron Golems will sometimes plant a decorative flower onto a nearby Copper Golem
  - The flower can be removed with Shears
  - This flower is dropped when the Copper Golem turns into a Copper Golem Statue Block

### Chat Drafts

- Unsent chat messages now get saved as chat drafts if the chat was forcibly closed
  - This includes it being closed by external sources such as dying or a dialog opening, but not the player intentionally closing their chat
- Any existing chat draft will get pre-filled into the message box the next time the chat is opened
- Draft text has a grayed-out appearance until fully restored
  - Draft text can be restored as regular text by interacting with it:
    - Typing additional text
    - Moving the text cursor using the arrow keys
    - Clicking it
    - Highlighting it
  - Pressing enter on a chat draft prior to it being restored sends it like a normal chat message
  - Pressing backspace on a chat draft prior to it being restored deletes it
- Added an option to the Chat Settings menu that enables saving unsent chat messages by default
  - With this option enabled, unsent messages will *always* get saved as chat drafts, even if the player intentionally closed their chat

## Changes

- Players seen in the game world of the current server are now always shown in the Social Interactions screen even if they are offline

### Blocks

#### Shelf

- Items in the Shelf will render in the middle of the Shelf
- Updated the sizes of many items in the Shelf to better fit the Shelf

> **Developer's Note:** *Thank you for all your valuable feedback on the shelf! Seeing the many creative ways you've been using this new block, we've decided to revert the change from last week that positioned items at the bottom of the shelf, as we agree that having the items centered provides more creative opportunities when building.*

### UI

#### Chat

- It is now possible to start chatting while standing inside a Nether Portal
- The chat will now remain open and unchanged if the player was chatting before being transferred to another dimension

## Technical Changes

- The Data Pack version is now 83.1
- The Resource Pack version is now 65.2
- Added new display transform "on_shelf"
  - Used for displaying items on the Shelf

## Data Pack Version 83.1

### Block States

- Added align_items_to_bottom block state property to the Shelf block
  - If false the items on the Shelf will ignore the vertical translation of the on_shelf item display transform and will be rendered vertically aligned to the middle of the Shelf
  - If true the items on the Shelf will be rendered upward from the bottom of the Shelf and will respect the vertical translation of the on_shelf item display transform
  - Default is false (items are aligned to the middle of the Shelf)

### Attributes

#### run_command Click Event

- Previously, if the command field contained a command that required a signed message (/say, /me, /msg, /tell, /w, /teammsg, /tm), it would be silently discarded
- Instead, a screen will be shown that lets the user insert the command into the chat window or copy the command to their clipboard if the chat window can't be opened

### Enchantments

#### explode Effects

New field: block_effects - specifies per-block particles. Each block particle is randomly chosen according to weights. A set limit of block particles is spawned each tick from all explosions that tick.

Format: List of entries:

- weight: Non-negative integer representing the random weight for this entry being chosen
- particle: The particle to spawn
- scaling: Optional scaling to apply between explosion center and block position, or 1.0 if not specified
- speed: Optional scaling to apply to the speed of the particle, or 1.0 if not specified

### Tags

#### Item Tags

- Added \#shearable_from_copper_golem - all items that can be removed from the Copper Golem's head slot via Shears

## Resource Pack Version 65.2

### Textures

- Added a new texture:
  - environment/end_flash.png

### Sounds

#### Sound Events

- Added new sound event:
  - weather.end_flash
