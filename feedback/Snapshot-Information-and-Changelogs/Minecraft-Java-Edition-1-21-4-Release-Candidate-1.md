After yesterday's [announcement](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-garden-awakens-drop-date) that the The Garden Awakens drop comes out on December 3rd, today we're releasing the first release candidate!

If no new critical issues surface, this is the version we are planning to ship as Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.4.

Happy Mining!
