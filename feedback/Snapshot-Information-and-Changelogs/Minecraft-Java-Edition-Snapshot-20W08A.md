# FIXED BUG IN 20W08A

-   [MC-172078](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-172078) - All villagers with saved memory disappear when upgrading to 20w07a

**14 February 2020**

Ahh, a freshly baked snapshot! It undoubtedly smells better than the piglins that we just added\...

# FEATURES IN 20W07A

-   Endermen can now pick up some of the new Nether blocks
-   Endermen will no longer pick up Netherrack
-   Gave Hoglins some actual functionality
-   Added Piglins
-   The Wither can now be summoned using soul soil as base
-   Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and Netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok.

## ADVANCEMENTS

-   Piglins and Hoglins are now required for Monster Hunter and Monsters Hunted

## HOGLINS

-   Hoglins are big aggressive beasts that live in crimson forests in the Nether
-   They attack players on sight, so be careful, they can easily knock you off a ledge!
-   Hoglins drop pork and sometimes leather, but not willingly
-   You can breed Hoglins by feeding them crimson fungi, but do so at your own risk
-   Hoglins get hunted by Piglins sometimes, but they don't go down without a fight!
-   Despite this, Hoglins and Piglin aren't enemies -- they are more like an ecosystem
-   Baby Hoglins like to pretend they are tough -- but don't worry, they are more like angry puppies with no teeth
-   Want to keep Hoglins off your back? Pro tip: Hoglins hate the smell of warped fungi!

## PIGLINS

-   Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the Nether
-   They mostly hang around in crimson forests, but you might find\
    some in the Nether wastes too
-   They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
-   However, if you dress appropriately they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least
-   Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest, or mining a block of gold,\
    they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
-   Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
-   Gold ingots are currency to Piglins and you can throw ingots at them or right-click them with an\
    ingot to barter for various goods
-   Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt Hoglins for food. Or they try at least. They results... vary.
-   Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups, and when a fight is happening everyone wants in
-   Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly
-   Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified Piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible
-   Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and Piglins will attack on sight
-   Baby Piglins are not as dangerous, but they can be mischievous so watch your back
-   ... and they like to play with baby Hoglins
