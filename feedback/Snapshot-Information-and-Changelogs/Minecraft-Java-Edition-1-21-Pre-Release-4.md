Frog day on a Friday? What could go wrong? We're back with 1.21 Pre-Release 4 today, with a couple more bug fixes, and some tweaks to the Blast Resistance and Fire Protection enchantments.

## CHANGES

- The "Burning Time" reduction effect of Fire Protection and "Knockback Resistance" effect of Blast Protection now stack from wearing several pieces
  - To get the maximum benefit of these effects, you now need to wear a full set of enchanted armor
  - Wearing a fully enchanted armor set still grants the same effect as in 1.20.6
  - Wearing only a single piece of enchanted armor now has reduced effect compared to before
- After a Primed TNT has gone through a Nether Portal, it will no longer be able to destroy Nether Portal blocks
