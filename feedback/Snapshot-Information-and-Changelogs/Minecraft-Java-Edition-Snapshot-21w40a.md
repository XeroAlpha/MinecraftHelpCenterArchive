Yet another snapshot is now available for Minecraft Java. This time around we've done some additional tweaks to world generation and a few changes to mob spawning.

We've continuously made performance improvements since we released the first Caves & Cliffs: Part II snapshot (21w37a), and we've created another survey about performance. If you try out the snapshot, we would very much appreciate it if you could fill out [this survey](http://aka.ms/MCPerfPoll) and tell us how you perceive the current performance. Thanks and happy mining!

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

# CHANGES IN 21W40A

- World generation tweaks
- Changes to mob spawning
- Copper Ore now drops 2-5 (from 2-3) Raw Copper items
- In the Stonecutter, a Block of Copper can be converted to four Cut Copper
- A bunch of biome variants with similar features but different shapes have been merged into one since the shape is controlled independently now
- Renamed some biomes

## WORLD GENERATION

- Updated ore distribution to make branch mining deep down more rewarding. [Updated ore distribution chart](https://images.ctfassets.net/8y6ykjruobr4/29MoVuTVm4HDgaYuRaEyZW/65db8f6a4c66f54fb47df33c999a7f2e/snapshot-21w-40a-ore-distribution-6th_iteration.jpg)
  - For example, added more unexposed diamonds
  - Iron ore now generates above 80, with more iron ore as you go higher
  - Extra gold generates below height -48
- Non-cave biomes no longer change with height - so no more savannas in the sky and things like that
- Tweaked the relative size of some biomes to match 1.17 a bit closer.
- Increased the average size of most biomes (this also means biomes aren’t in the same places as before)
- Fixed some aquifer issues (a side effect of this is that aquifers are in different places now compared to last snapshot)
- Slightly increased the frequency of underwater magma
- Increased the amount of dungeons, especially below height 0
- Gravel now generates below height 0
- Villages are slightly more spread out
- Removed water lake features, Aquifers provide local water levels

## MOB SPAWNS

- Axolotls now only spawn in water, above clay blocks, in lush caves
- Glowsquids now only spawn in water blocks, under height 30
- Cod, Salmon, Pufferfish, Tropical Fish, Squid, and Dolphins now only spawn in water from height 50 to height 64
- Tropical Fish now also spawn in lush caves at any height
- Zombies once again spawn in dripstone caves – drowned can also spawn there however
- Goats no longer spawn in stony peaks
