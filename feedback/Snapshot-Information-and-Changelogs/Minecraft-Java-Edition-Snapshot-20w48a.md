Did someone ask for a snapshot full of tasty Caves & Cliffs features? Then you came to the right place! This particular snapshot adds blocks for dripstone – stalagmites and stalactites. Or is it stalactites and stalagmites? Anyway, you can’t find them in the world just yet… but try out the functionality of the new blocks!

# NEW FEATURES IN 20W48A

- Added dripstone blocks and pointed dripstone

## POINTED DRIPSTONE

- Forms a stalactite if placed on the ceiling or a stalagmite if placed on the floor
- Can be combined to form longer stalactites & stalagmites
- Stalagmites break if not attached to something below
- Landing or jumping on a stalagmite hurts! They are sharp
- Stalactites fall down if not attached to something above
- Being hit by falling stalactite hurts! They are sharp
- Stalactites drip water (or lava if there is lava above the ceiling)
- A stalactite with a water source above the ceiling will gradually fill a cauldron below with water
- A stalactite with a lava source above the ceiling will fill a cauldron below with lava after a while
- Thrown tridents break pointed dripstone

# CHANGES IN 20W48A

- Right-clicking a bundle in the inventory now empties one item from the bundle
- Using a bundle now throws out its entire content into the world
- Advanced tooltips now show how full a bundle is
- Candles can now only be placed if there is a solid surface below
- Wearing any piece of leather armour now prevents freezing entirely
- Changed textures for amethysts, candles, clocks and compasses

# TECHNICAL CHANGES IN 20W48A
