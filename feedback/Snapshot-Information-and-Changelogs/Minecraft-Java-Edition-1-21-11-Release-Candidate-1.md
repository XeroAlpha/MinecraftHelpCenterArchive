As we are getting ready for the release of the Mounts of Mayhem drop on December 9th, today we are shipping the first Release Candidate. If there are no critical issues, this will be the version that we release on Tuesday.

## Changes

### Spear Weapon

- Increased the duration during which the Spear can deal knockback while charging
  - The Charge Attack animations now better correspond to the different phases of the Spear
