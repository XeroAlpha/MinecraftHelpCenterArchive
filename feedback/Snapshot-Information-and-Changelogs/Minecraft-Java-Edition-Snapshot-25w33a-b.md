This week it's time for a smaller snapshot with a new main menu panorama, code of conducts for servers and much tinkering and fixing with our new friends, the Copper Golems. Happy mining!

> **Developer's Note**: *The rendering changes introduced in 25w31a for entities are now expanded to affect block entities and items. Please report any issues you encounter in these areas.*

**Update**: We have now released Snapshot 25w34b to fix some connectivity errors with Realms.

## Fixed bugs in 25w34b

- [MC-300911](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-300911) - Glowing item & block displays no longer glow

## New Features

- Servers can now have an in-game Code of Conduct

### Server Code of Conduct

When connecting to a server, a Code of Conduct screen can now be shown.

- Accepting the Code of Conduct is required to play on the server
- A checkbox is available for not showing the same Code of Conduct in the future
  - If the Code of Conduct changes, it will be shown again

#### Server Setup

- A new boolean field has been added to server.properties called enable-code-of-conduct
  - Setting it to true will make the server look for code of conduct files in the codeofconduct subfolder in the same folder as server.properties
  - Each file in the folder should have the form \<language_code\>.txt
    - The language shown will attempt to match the player's language
    - If it doesn't exist, the en_us code of conduct will be used
    - If that also doesn't exist, an arbitrary available entry is used

## Changes

- The main menu now has an updated background panorama showing Copper Golems in a Village

### The End Light Flashes

- The sound effect produced by a flash now has a higher delay
- The "Hide Lightning Flashes" accessibility setting has been renamed to "Hide Sky Flashes" and now also disables the End Flashes
  - When the flash is disabled by the setting the world will not be lit by the flash, but the flash source will still be visible in the sky and the sound effect will still play

### Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities

- The eyes of the Copper Golem are now invisible as well when splashed with Potion of Invisibility
- Copper Golems hitbox has been tweaked
  - The hitbox is now 0.6 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through open doors
  - The hitbox is now 1.01 blocks in height to not get stuck in certain blocks

### Sounds

- Copper Golem & Copper Chests are now audible from up to 12 blocks away
- The copper sorting sounds have been tweaked to be quieter

## Technical Changes

- The Data Pack version is now 84.0
- The Resource Pack version is now 66.0

## Data Pack Version 84.0

- Player profiles in data components and block entities no longer resolve automatically
- Added fetchprofile command for downloading player profiles

### Block States

- Removed align_items_to_bottom block state property from Shelf block
  - It has been replaced with an equally named boolean field on the Shelf block entity
  - Shelves created with this property set in the last snapshot will reset back to the default value (false)

### Commands

#### Added fetchprofile

- New command that has been added to fetch the contents of a player profile from Minecraft servers
- Since the operation might take some time, it works asynchronously
  - Results will be printed only when operation finishes, but the game will keep running unpaused
- After successful completion, a message will be printed that lets users copy the contents of a fully resolved minecraft:profile component or /give @s minecraft:player_head with said component
- Since the result is not known at the time of execution, this command always returns 1

Syntax:

- fetchprofile name \<player name\> - resolves profile by name (case-insensitive)
- fetchprofile id \<uuid\> - resolves profile by id

### Data Components

#### Modified minecraft:profile

- Previously contents of this component would permanently change when profile was resolved, i.e. downloaded from Minecraft service
- To avoid issues with this unexpected change, the resolved value is no longer stored and contents of the profile will always remain unchanged
- That means this component has now two behaviors:
  - Static: when it has properties field or when both name and id are present or when both are missing
    - In this state, profile will always render as-is
    - If properties field is missing, a default skin will be used (selected based on id, same as in offline mode)
    - That means skin will be frozen at the moment of component creation
    - This option is preferred for decorational uses
  - Dynamic: when it has either name or id (but not both)
    - When an item containing this profile is rendered on the client side, the profile will be resolved to most recent value
    - This means that this item will always render with current skin of targeted player
      - Note: if a player changes skin while game is running, change will not be visible unless clients restart
    - Resolution might happen with a delay, during which item will render with a default skin
    - Profile name will replace item name only when it's present
      - Items with just id will show default name
    - Items will dynamic profiles be distinguished from static ones with label in tooltip
- Items stack based on exact contents, so even if a dynamic component is eventually resolved to the same profile as a static one, they won't stack together
- Player heads in older maps that have not been loaded in never versions yet will usually be converted to dynamic contents

### Block Entity Data

#### Modified minecraft:skull

- profile field has been changed to match minecraft:profile component
  - That means that it also becomes immutable and is resolved only when necessary

### Text components

- Bold and italics styles are ignored when drawing sprites

## Resource Pack Version 66.0

- Removed block state align_items_to_bottom from the Shelf block
  - See above for details
