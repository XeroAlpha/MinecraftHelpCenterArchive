### What is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition? 

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition has been the codebase on mobile and Windows 10 and above since 2012. 

### How does this version differ from the one I already own? 

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition delivers a united experience to players on all platforms that use this codebase. Build with friends via cross-play on other console platforms and mobile devices, play multiplayer mini-games through servers, and customize how you play with community content available through the in-game Marketplace. 

### I already own Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition, so how do I get this new version? 

Players who already own Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition can download the new version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition free of charge. Either follow the prompts in-game to download or find it directly in the Nintendo eShop. 

### Will downloadable content (DLC) I currently own transfer over to the new version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition? 

All existing DLC content will be transferred automatically from Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. 

### What's a Microsoft account and why do I need it for a Nintendo Switch? 

A Microsoft account is a free account you use to sign in on a device that allows Minecraft: Bedrock Edition players on Switch to play with others on non-Nintendo devices such as iOS, Android, Xbox One, and Windows 10 (and above) via cross-play, Realms, or Servers.

Having a Microsoft account also enables the portability of your Minecoins and Marketplace purchases to other devices and platforms. For more information go to the Xbox.com article, [Minecraft for Nintendo Switch FAQ](https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/games-apps/game-titles/minecraft-switch-edition-faq). To create an account, go to the [How to Manage Parental Consent, Family Settings and Realms/Multiplayer Access for a Child Account](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077-How-to-Manage-Parental-Consent-Family-Settings-and-Realms-Multiplayer-Access-for-a-Child-Account) page. 

### Now that I have a Microsoft account, how do I sign into it from my Nintendo Switch? 

-   On the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition game home screen, click **Sign in with a Microsoft account**. 
-   You'll see a screen asking you for a unique eight-digit code. 
-   Enter the URL shown on the screen on another device (PC or mobile phone). 
-   Follow the instructions on the website by entering the code and to finish signing into your Microsoft account. \

### How do I find my friends on their Microsoft account? 

-   Now that you've signed into your Microsoft account, select **Play** on the home screen. 
-   Toggle to the right onto the **Friends** tab. 
-   Select the button to **Add Friend**.
-   Find friends by entering their Microsoft Gamertags. 

### I keep entering my friend's Gamertag into cross-platform friends and can't find them. Why? 

Make sure you enter your friend's Gamertag correctly. Please note that you are only able to enter Microsoft Gamertags. Player IDs from other platforms are not supported at this time. You can also try having your friend add you instead to see if that works for you. 

### Do I need to pay a subscription fee like Xbox Game Pass Core to play online? 

Online subscription fees are determined by the platform you play on, so an Xbox Live subscription is not required for Nintendo Switch players, but a Nintendo Switch Online subscription is required for multiplayer when that service launches. We recommend a free Microsoft account for players to get the most out of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. 

## What is Minecraft Marketplace? 

The Minecraft Marketplace is the name of our in-game store. New character skins, textures, and worlds made by creators in the Minecraft community are available through the Marketplace for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. With Minecraft Marketplace, we\'ve made it safer and easier to purchase community-made content for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Buy content once while signed in with a Microsoft account and enjoy it on any supported device with no expiration. 

### What are Minecoins? 

Minecoins (Minecraft coins) let you buy content from creators in our Marketplace, safely and securely. You can purchase them with real currency in the game store and eShop. Coins are kept in your virtual wallet and can also be used on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Android, iOS, Chromebook, Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles, and Windows 10 (and above) if you have a Microsoft account. 

## Do my existing worlds transfer? 

Yes, your existing worlds from Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition will convert over to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

You can move your saved world files from Minecraft on the Nintendo Wii U to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on the Nintendo Switch.   

-   Turn on both your Wii U and your Switch and launch Minecraft. They will both need to be on for the transfer.   \

-   Wait for the Switch to accept the transfer. Once completed, press **Play Game** on your Nintendo Switch, then on the main menu on the Switch, press **Play Game**.   
-   Connect to Nintendo Network; you must be online.   
-   On the **Load** tab, press **Y** to select **Transfer save from Wii U**.

### How do I transfer existing worlds from Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Nintendo Switch to another version of Minecraft? 

*In Minecraft: Bedrock Edition:* 

-   If you select the **Sync Old Worlds** button at the bottom of the worlds list in the play menu, it finds any worlds on the device from the Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition (developed by 4J Studios) and displays them below the button. 
-   Select any of the newly found worlds to convert them Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. 
-   After conversion, the world shows up above the **Sync Old Worlds** button with the rest of your Bedrock worlds. 

### How big are worlds in this version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Nintendo Switch? 

World size is infinite in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Nintendo Switch. 

### I'm playing in a world that was transferred from the previous version. Does it have any size limitations? 

Transferring to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition changes the world type to infinite, keeping the portions of the world from the 4J version the same, but generating new chunks outside of that area. 

### Can I play Realms on this edition? 

Yes, Realms is available on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Nintendo Switch. To play online on a Nintendo Switch, you must have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, so this is a requirement for playing on Realms. Learn more information about [Nintendo Switch Online](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service). 

### What additional content is included? 

The Super Mario Mash-Up Pack is preinstalled with the game. You can download the remaining content (Natural Texture pack, Biome Settlers Skin pack, Battle & Beasts Skin pack, Campfire Tales Skin pack) from the in-game store. 

### Can my friends on Xbox play the Super Mario Mash-Up? 

No, the Super Mario Mash-Up is playable only by Nintendo Switch owners in single player, split screen, local network, and over Nintendo Switch Online. 

### How do I link my previous purchases on other Minecraft: Bedrock Editions to my Switch version? 

Log into Minecraft and sign into your Microsoft account. All your content will sync automatically with other purchases you've made with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on other platforms. 

### I own Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition and I\'ve purchased previous DLC. How do I get it to sync to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition? 

-   Log into Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition on your Nintendo Switch account. This will sync the latest purchases. 
-   Log into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on your Nintendo Switch and you\'ll automatically be granted the entitlements for that DLC. 

**Note: For every purchase, you made on the previous version, you must first log into Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition, exit, and then launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for your purchases to sync. DLC purchased within Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition will remain only on your Nintendo Switch device and will not transfer to other devices. **

## Issues with Lagging or Crashing for Nintendo Switch 

If you are experiencing any issues with lagging, crashing, or hanging on the Switch, you may be able to solve your issue with a full restart.  

-   Fully restart your console from the power options in settings.   
-   Select and launch Minecraft without opening other games or apps.   

**Note: If this did not solve your issue, as a temporary workaround, try not signing into a Microsoft account. While you won\'t have access to servers, Realms, or possibly Marketplace content, you can play single-player & split-screen worlds.  **

**Additional note: Please note that the Nintendo Switch is an older console, and it may struggle to run newer versions of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.**

If you still have issues with gameplay performance, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support) or submit a [bug report here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/bugs).
