## iOS 13 or Above Required for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition  

As Minecraft grows, so must the operating system that supports it. If you are on the most up-to-date version of iOS already, you have nothing to worry about. For some older devices, you may need to update to iOS 13 or above by February 2024 to continue receiving updates for Minecraft or to access online play. Please follow Apple's guide on how to [update your device](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204). You can also refer to [their list of devices currently compatible with iOS 13/iPadOS13.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210327)

For Minecraft Realms subscriptions on iOS 12 or lower devices, your Realm will continue to work for up to six months post-sunset. Within that timeframe, you can access the Realm on a device running iOS 13 or later, back-up the world on a local storage device, or cancel your subscription through the Settings menu in Subscriptions on the device the Realm was created.

If you need more assistance in updating your version of iOS, contact Apple's [support team](https://support.apple.com/). \

## Jurassic World on iOS  

The Jurassic World pack was released on the Minecraft Marketplace on August 18, 2020. This release is jam-packed with complex mob behaviors, animations, audio, and blocks.

Because of this release's memory demands, some iOS devices may need adjustments to run smoothly. The best way to stop or reduce possible crashes on iOS devices is to do one of the following: 

1.  Upgrade to the most recent iOS version (at least 13.2.3) if your device is supported. 
2.  Go to your **Settings** menu and reduce the **Render Distance** in the **Video** section from the default of 20 to 16. 
3.  While iPhone 6 devices can run the pack, they may experience higher crash rates. You may want to decrease your **Render Distance** further to improve stability. If you intend to play the pack primarily using an iPhone 6 your game-play experience may be impacted by performance issues. 

With these adjustments, possible crash rates should be significantly reduced. 

## How to Recover Missing Worlds (iOS Only)  

This article documents the steps for searching and recovering a missing world in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on iOS devices. Start with these steps:  

1.  Make sure your app is up to date by going to the App store and selecting **Update**. If updating the app isn\'t available, it\'s most likely up to date.  
2.  Open the Minecraft Marketplace.  
3.  Select the **Store**.  
4.  Scroll down to purchases and select **Restore Purchases**.  

If you made purchases through the App Store, you can also restore your purchases in the App Store. Doing so requires you to use the account associated with the Apple device. 

To restore missing game data, you can either check if it has been stored in Apple iCloud storage or through the iTunes backup. This restoration will work only if you have the iCloud file sharing service enabled on your device.  

**Note**: **The standard storage space for the iCloud on Apple devices is 5GB unless you purchase more space. The iCloud service prioritizes space by backing up necessary data. This means the Phonebook, Camera, and Text messages will be backed up first.**** **

You can retrieve game data when you reinstall the game application for iCloud and iTunes as follows: 

## Recovery from iCloud  

For use with files that have been backed up automatically with iCloud:  

1.  Go to **Settings**.  
2.  Select **iCloud**.  
3.  Go to **Storage and Backup**.  
4.  Select the backup you want to restore.  
5.  Wait until the restoration completes.   

## Recovery from iTunes  

For use with files that have been backed up or synced with iTunes:  

1.  Connect the iOS device to your computer, open iTunes, and choose the device.  
2.  Select **Apps**, and then scroll down below the list of apps to file sharing.  
3.  *\"Apps in the list below can share documents between the iPhone and the computer\".*  
4.  Select **Minecraft PE**.  
5.  To the right, there is now a folder symbol called \"games\". Select to highlight this folder.  
6.  Scroll down and choose **Save to**.  
7.  When restoring click **Add**.  
8.  When you restart the application go to your worlds to confirm they are there.  

## iOS 14 Sign-in Issue 

With the update of iOS 14, Apple has introduced many new privacy features. For example, players are prompted with a notification upon opening Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for the first time. "Minecraft would like to find and connect to devices on your local network."

You must select OK and allow this connection because you will not be able to sign in to your account without allowing this permission. Some features, such as the Marketplace and single-player worlds, may still work, but multiplayer and Realms will not be available. 

If you already declined this popup, you may be unable to log in until Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is updated for iOS 14. We are currently working on updating the game. But you may still encounter this bug until the patch is complete. Thank you for your patience.
