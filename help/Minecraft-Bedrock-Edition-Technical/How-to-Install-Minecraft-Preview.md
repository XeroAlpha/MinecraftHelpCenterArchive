Minecraft Preview is played through a separate client from the normal Minecraft: Bedrock Edition so you can test out the latest and greatest features before they’re released in the standard version.

## How to Install Minecraft Preview/Beta

Locate your platform in the list below for installation instructions for Minecraft Preview/Beta.

- **Not a Trial:** You must either own Minecraft on the platform you want to play Preview on or be an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass for PC subscriber to have access.
- **Download purchase only:** Minecraft Preview is not available for players who only own a disc version of Minecraft.

### Android

**Note:** Minecraft Beta on Android will replace your normal Minecraft client. Be sure to [back up](../Minecraft-Realms-Plus/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-Backup-FAQ.md) or [transfer your worlds](./How-to-Transfer-Your-World-to-Another-Device-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) to another device!

1.  Start the Google Play Store app.
2.  Enter the Minecraft page.
3.  Scroll down to find a button to enroll in Minecraft Beta.
4.  The beta app will automatically replace your normal Minecraft app.
    - You can leave Minecraft Beta at any time by returning to the Google Play Store page on your device.
