## How to play in splitscreen (consoles only)

Playing split screen allows up to four players to play on the same screen at the same time. Splitscreen play is available only for consoles.

2.  Power on and connect the additional controllers for other players
3.  Have those players press A to sign in and join the game

## How to play on an online server

1.  From the title screen, select **Play**
2.  Go to the **Servers** tab
3.  Select which partner server you would like to join
4.  If the server you want to join is not in the partner list, you can scroll to the bottom and click **Add Server** (PC and mobile only)
5.  Input the server information
    - You can get the server name, address, and port from the server owner
    - For Minecraft servers that are safe to join and fun for all ages, check out [our official Minecraft server listing site.](https://findmcserver.com/)
