When playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, you can play a single-player or multiplayer game. If you'd like to play with other people. This article outlines the different ways to play multiplayer and provides some troubleshooting steps if you are having difficulty playing multiplayer games.

## Playing on a Local Area Network (LAN) 

This requires opening your home or local area network (LAN) to others who are also connected to that network. Here is how to connect to a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition LAN for mobile devices, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Windows, or Xbox.

### Before you start: 

- Each player that wants to join must be connected to the same network.  
- The selected host device must be capable of running a server of the chosen world.  
- Everyone joining must run the same version of the game as the host. 
- Everyone joining the game must have their own, separate Microsoft Accounts.

### Start a LAN game: 

1.  Click **Play**
2.  Create a new world or edit a current world. 
3.  Go to **Multiplayer** and make sure that **Visible to LAN Players** is enabled. 
4.  Choose **Create** or **Play** to start the world. 

### Join a LAN game: 

1.  Go to the **Play**
2.  Click the **Friends** tab and look for available LAN Games. 

## Playing on an Online Server 

For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition you can also choose from several [Partner Servers](./Minecraft-Dedicated-and-Partner-Servers-FAQ.md).

### Join a server: 

- On the **Servers** tab, click a server. 

### Add an external server: 

- On the **Servers** tab, click **Add Server** and enter the necessary information.   
  If you need help locating this information, contact the server owner. 

### WHERE TO FIND SERVERS:

If you want to start exploring other party community servers visit our [Official Server Listing Site](https://findmcserver.com/). Each server offers its own brand of fun and uniqueness. Find your favorite with the Server Listing Site, where all servers have been reviewed and following our community standards and guidelines. Browse servers based on game type, play style, and more. Chance is there’s a server listed for you – regardless of age or the way you play.

**Note: Due to platform restrictions, the external server feature is not available on consoles. **

## Split Screen 

Playing split screen allows up to four players to play on the same screen at the same time. Split screen play is available only for consoles (Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch).

### Playing Split Screen 

Start the game and connect the controllers. This automatically divides the display into player-specific screens (one for each player). 

## Troubleshooting Multiplayer Connection Issues

- Make sure you’re not using a beta version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If you are, leave it and restart the game.
- If you’re playing on an Xbox, Sony PlayStation™, or Nintendo Switch, ensure you have that console’s online subscription service active. This means you need an active subscription to Xbox Game Pass Core, PlayStation® Plus, or Nintendo Switch Online as needed by your console.
- Closing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and reopening it.
- Restart your computer or device and see if this fixes the issue. Restarting can often clear errors in connections.
- Log out of your Microsoft or Mojang account, close the game, and then log in again.
- If you use a wireless connection, ensure that you have a stable connection to your router. You may need to reset or restart your router.
- Check your currently running programs for anything that is using your Internet bandwidth and close those programs.
- If you have a firewall or antivirus software or are using a VPN, check the settings to be sure that it is not blocking or slowing your connection.
- Configure your router to use moderate or open Network Address Translation (NAT).
- If you’re on a stationary device, try connecting using an Ethernet cable instead of using Wi-Fi.
- Try reverting to a previous save of your world.
- If you are under 18, make sure your parents log in to change your [settings](https://account.xbox.com/settings) as shown below: 

### Problems Playing While Using a Child Account

If you’re having problems connecting while playing with a Child Account, see: [I’m Getting an Error When Trying to Play Multiplayer with a Child Account](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Accounts/I-m-Getting-an-Error-When-Trying-to-Play-Multiplayer-with-a-Child-Account.md).   

### Prevented from Online Access to Microsoft Account

You may need to log into your Microsoft account *outside* of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. It’s recommended that you go to Xbox.com and log into your Microsoft Account/Xbox Live Account there. Some users reported this issue when trying to connect to the same Microsoft account and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition across multiple devices at once. This solution would be to only play on a specific account on one device at a time.

### Marketplace Doesn’t Display Anything

This can usually be solved by resetting your Internet connection on the device or by logging off and then back into your Microsoft account.

## Didn’t Find the Answer?

The troubleshooters above are general but work on most issues. If you have other technical issues, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support), briefly describe the issue, and your Xbox Live Gamertag.
