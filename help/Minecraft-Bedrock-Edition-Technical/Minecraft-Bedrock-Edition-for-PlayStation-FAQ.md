## Accounts and Connecting 

**Note: As of March 15, 2023, please DO NOT unlink your MSA from your PlayStation account via the in-game menu. You will be unable to link it back if you do so.**

### What’s a Microsoft account and why do I need it for PS4/5™? 

A Microsoft account is not required to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on PS™. It does allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition players on PS™ to play with other players on non-PS™ devices like Android, iOS, Switch, Windows 10, Xbox One/Series consoles, and Chromebook. 

### What is a Microsoft account?   

It’s a free account that’s used to verify your access to computers and Microsoft services and applications. Your Microsoft account lets you manage everything all in one. If you use any of these services, you have a Microsoft account:

Having a Microsoft account also enables the portability of your Marketplace (devices other than PS) or Minecraft Store (PS™) purchases to other devices and platforms. 

### Linking a Microsoft account to a Playstation® account 

**Note: ****Once a Microsoft account has been linked to a PlayStation® account, neither the Microsoft account nor the PlayStation™ Network account can be associated with a different account.**  

If you choose to unlink accounts, then purchases will be returned to the account which made the purchase. **Even after unlinking, Microsoft and PlayStation® accounts can only be re-linked to the original account.** 

### I have a Microsoft account; how do I sign in on my PlayStation™?  

**Note: Be certain you use the account details for the Microsoft account you want to be associated with your PlayStation™ Network account.**  

Once a Microsoft account has been linked to a PlayStation™ Network account, neither the Microsoft account nor the PlayStation™ Network account can be associated with a different account.  

You will not be able to link another Microsoft account to your PSN™ account.  

#### Sign in to PSN™ with your Microsoft Account 

1.  On the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition game home screen, click **Sign in with a Microsoft account**.  
2.  Follow the instructions on the page to go to <http://aka.ms/remoteconnect> to enter the unique 8-digit code and complete your sign-in.  

#### How do I find my friends on their Microsoft accounts? 

1.  Sign into your Microsoft account and click **Play** on the home screen. 
2.  Tab to the right to reach the **Friends** tab.  
3.  Click **Add Friend**.  
4.  Find friends by entering their Microsoft Gamertag in the **Search** box.  

### Why can’t I find my friend’s Gamertag? 

Make sure you are entering your friend’s Gamertag correctly.   

**Note: You may only enter a Microsoft Gamertag as a player ID. Player IDs from other platforms are not supported at this time.   **

### How many Microsoft accounts can you tie to your PlayStation™ Network account? 

You can only tie one Microsoft account to a PlayStation™ Network account.   

#### What happens when I unlink my Microsoft account? 

**Note:** **Once a Microsoft account has been linked to a PlayStation™ Network account, it *****cannot***** be unlinked without loss of access to entitlements and Minecoins on other platforms.**  

### Why can’t I connect accounts? 

Sometimes players attempting to link their Microsoft Account to their PSN™ ID encounter errors. There are two common error messages players see: 

#### “Failed to log in—scenario one” 

When you see this error message, it means that the Microsoft account is already connected to another account on the PlayStation™ Network. 

![blobid0.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4405103043597)

The solution is to link the PSN™ ID to a different Microsoft account since the Microsoft Account you’re attempting to use is already connected to a different PSN™ ID. Each Microsoft account may only be linked to a single PSN™ ID and vice versa. 

#### “Failed to log in—scenario two” 

When you see this error message, it means that the PSN™ ID you're attempting to link from is already connected with a Microsoft Account.  

![blobid1.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4405097191309)

That’s good news! This error message tells you which Microsoft account the PSN™ ID is connected to. The solution is to sign in with the correct listed account. For example, in the image, you would sign in with the account **MyOtherMSAccoun****t** where the “other account” is your other account name.  

## Minecraft and PlayStation™ Versions 

### What is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition? 

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition refers to any current non-Java edition of the game.  

- Multi-Platform – You can play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on console, mobile, and PC.
- Marketplace – Add-Ons or Skin packs can be purchased from the marketplace to change your gameplay experience/
- Cross-Play – Minecraft: Bedrock Edition players can play with any other Bedrock platform.
- Runs Smooth – Minecraft: Bedrock Edition does not require powerful computers or devices to run and will often run more smoothly than Minecraft: Java Edition
- Controls – Minecraft: Bedrock Edition has the option to switch to a controller for movement or touch controls if on a mobile device
- Moderation and Parental Controls – Since Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is connected to Xbox’s services the online experience is more heavily moderated and parental controls can be finer tuned  

### How is this version different than the one I already own?  

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition delivers a unified experience to players on all platforms that use the Bedrock codebase. You can cross-play with friends no matter what device they’re using, play multiplayer mini-games, and customize how you play with community content available through the in-game Minecraft Marketplace/Minecraft Store.  

### When did this launch?  

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition launched on PS4™ on December 10th, 2019. If you already own the game, you’ll receive a patch update that will give you the Bedrock version of the game at no additional cost.   

### I already own a Minecraft: PS4™ Edition. How do I get the current version? 

Players who already own Minecraft: PS4™ Edition will receive the new version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition at no additional cost. Update your game with the latest patch and follow the instructions within the patch notes.  

### Will my copy of Minecraft: PS4™ Edition go away? Do I have to use the new one? 

Minecraft: PS4™ Edition will no longer be available to purchase, but people owning that edition can continue to play it. It will remain available as an option to choose from the in-game main menu.   

**Note: There will be no further updates to Minecraft: PS4™ Edition.    **

### Do I need to pay a subscription fee like Xbox LIVE Gold, to play online?  

Online subscription fees are determined by the platform you play on, so an Xbox Live Gold subscription is not required for PlayStation® players, but a PlayStation® Plus subscription is required for multiplayer. A free Microsoft account is optional but recommended for players to get the most out of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.  

## Gameplay 

### Do my existing worlds transfer?  

Yes, your existing worlds from Minecraft: PS4™ Edition will convert to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.  

**Note: Worlds on PS3™ will need to be converted to PS4™ and opened in Minecraft: PS4™ Edition first, to ensure that the worlds transfer over properly.  **

### How do I transfer existing worlds?  

#### Transfer existing worlds from Minecraft: PS4™ Edition to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition  

1.  In Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, on the **Play** menu, in the **Worlds** list, click **Sync Old Worlds** at the bottom of the worlds list in the play menu. This will let you find any worlds on the device from Minecraft: PS4™ edition and display them below the button.  
2.  Select any of the worlds to convert them to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.  

After the conversion, you’ll see the world(s) listed along with the rest of your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition worlds.  

### How big are worlds in Minecraft for PS™? 

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition worlds are now expanded, World Types are all Infinite, and there are no longer any world borders.  

### I’m playing in a world that was transferred from the previous version. Are there limitations on world size?  

Transferring to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition should change the World Type to Infinite, keeping the portions of the world from the previous Minecraft: PS4™ Edition the same, but generating new chunks outside of that area.  

### Can I connect to a custom server not in the server list?  

Due to console platform policy, you cannot connect to a server that is not in the servers list.   

### I have a custom skin on another bedrock platform. Can I use it on a PS™? 

Yes, if the custom skin was created with the in-game Character Creator. If you uploaded the custom skin to your device, it would not transfer to your PS™ system. This is the same for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch players.  

### Does Minecraft: Bedrock Edition support PlayStation®VR?  

Yes, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is supported on PlayStation**®** VR. 

### Does Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on PlayStation® have the new render dragon graphics engine for bedrock? 

Yes, Render Dragon has been added.  

### How do I play split-screen without a PlayStation® Plus subscription? 

Turn off Multiplayer in the Level settings prior to loading any account that is not PlayStation® Plus-enabled and before attempting to join in split-screen play.  

### I see a message that I don’t have enough storage to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on PlayStation®. What should I do? 

We are investigating what might be causing this issue. As a workaround, you might want to try deleting any old worlds that you don't want to keep, and also try clearing cached content by going to **Settings\>Storage.** 

## Downloadable Content, Minecraft Store, and More 

### Will downloadable content (DLC) I own transfer over to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition?  

Most existing downloadable content is transferable from Minecraft: PS4™ Edition to the new version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. However, some content may not be available to use on the new version and some content may only be used on your PS4™.  

### What is the Minecraft Store?  

The Minecraft Store, accessible from in-game, is where players can purchase character skins, textures, and worlds. With Minecraft Store, we've made it safer and easier to purchase community-made content for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Content purchased while signed in with a Microsoft account can be enjoyed on any device and will not expire.   

### What are Tokens? 

Purchasable with real currency in the Minecraft Store, Tokens let you buy content from creators in our store safely and securely on the PS™. Tokens are kept in your virtual wallet which can only be used in your PSN™ account.  

### Can I use my Minecoins on PS™?  

No, but you can continue using your Minecoins on non-PS™ Bedrock platforms. Content purchased on other platforms, unless the content is restricted to a particular platform, may be used on your PS™.  

### How do I link my previous purchases on other Minecraft bedrock versions to my PS™ game?  

Log into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and sign into your Microsoft account. All Marketplace/Minecraft Store items will sync automatically with other purchases you’ve made on other Minecraft: Bedrock Edition platforms, as long as those purchases were made while logged in to that same Microsoft account and are purchases that can roam to PS™.   

### I own Minecraft: PS4™ Edition and I’ve bought previous downloadable content. How do I get it to sync to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition?  

Log into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on your PS™ and the content will automatically sync that downloadable content in the latest version.   

### Does Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PS™ support mouse and keyboard input? 

Yes!

### Will you be running beta versions in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PS™? 

There are no plans around public beta programs for future updates to share at this time. 

### Can Players Unlock Xbox Achievements in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PS™?

Since PlayStation® already has its own award system, players of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PS™ can unlock Trophies. 

### If I download the update, can I revert to the prior update?  

No, but if you want to keep playing Minecraft: PS4™ Edition, it is an option you can choose from the first screen. If you choose Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and want to revert to PS4™ Edition, you can choose this from the in-game menu. 

### Does the update reset your trophies? 

No; your trophy status is maintained and new trophies from Minecraft: Bedrock Edition will be added. However, you can only migrate progress toward unlocking trophies from PS4™ Edition to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition once.
