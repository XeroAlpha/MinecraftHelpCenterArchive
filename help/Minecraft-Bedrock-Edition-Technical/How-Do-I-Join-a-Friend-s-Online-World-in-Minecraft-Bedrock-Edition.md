**How to join a friend’s world in Minecraft**

If you and your friend are playing on the same console, you can add each other to your friend’s list and invite each other using those menus. If you are on different platforms, like one on Xbox and the other on Nintendo Switch, here is how to add each other.

1.  From the Minecraft title screen, press **Play**
2.  Go to the **Friends** tab
3.  Click **Add Friend**
4.  Enter your friends gamertag (their Microsoft account username) to add them as a friend
5.  Once added, any joinable world that they are playing in will show up in the **Friends** tab

If the world is not showing up, have the world owner go into their world settings. In the **Multiplayer tab**, make sure that **Multiplayer Game** is turned on (toggled to the right). For more troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Unable to Join Multiplayer Worlds in Minecraft.](./Troubleshooting-Unable-to-Join-Multiplayer-Worlds-in-Minecraft.md)

**Note:** if you are playing Minecraft multiplayer on a console, you must be subscribed to either Xbox Game Pass Core, Nintendo Switch Online, or PlayStation Plus to be able to play with friends.
