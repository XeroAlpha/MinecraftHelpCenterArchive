This article provides Android technical support processes for you to follow as well as general knowledge about Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on Android devices.

## Update on Amazon Devices 1/20/2023

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is no longer available to download through Amazon on your Amazon devices. To download Minecraft on your Amazon device, please use the Google Play Store.

## Update on Android Devices

**Android Devices will Require Greater than 1 GB RAM, run OS 8 (Oreo) or Above****, and have** **OpenGL ES ****3.0 to run Minecraft.**

As Minecraft grows, so must the requirements for systems that support it.

As of February 2024, Android devices require greater than 1 GB RAM, run OS 8 (Oreo) or above, and have OpenGL ES 3.0 to run Minecraft.  However, there are a still few issues on some Android devices that meet this requirement where the game may crash or run slowly.  

Note: Devices with 1 GB or less of RAM, lower than OpenGL ES 3.0, or Android OS 7 (Nougat) or lower will no longer receive updates. You may be able to run the game but could experience higher rates of crashing or other performance issues.

For Minecraft Realms on OS 7 (Nougat) or lower devices, your Realm subscription can remain active for up to six months post-sunset. Within this timeframe, you can access the Realm on an OS 8 (Oreo) or above device, back-up the world on a local storage device, or cancel your subscription through your Google Play account.

If you are on a device that has more than 1GB of RAM, OpenGL ES 3.0 or higher, and runs Android 8 or higher, and are still experiencing issues, these solutions may help improve stability:

-   Upgrade to the most recent version of the Android operating system (OS).    
-   In the **Settings** menu: 
    -   Reduce the **Render Distance** in the **Video** section from the default of 20 to 16. You can try going lower if necessary.
-   Change the **Graphics **setting to **Fast**. This reduces graphic resolution quality but enables the device to render faster.   
-   Change the **Clouds** setting to **Off**.    
-   Change the **Particles** setting to **Decreased** or **Minimal**. This removes particle effects like smoke.   
-   If you have additional programs running in the background on the device, pause or exit those programs to free up more processing power for Minecraft. 

**Note: Playing the game on an older version of the operating system may impact your gameplay experience with continued performance issues. It's highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version of the OS. **

## I purchased Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, but it is not appearing in my Google Play Family library 

In the Google Play Store app, navigate to **My Apps & Games **within the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition details page, and turn on **Family Library**. 

## I cannot launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition even though it is listed in my Family Library 

Make sure that each family device is signed up to the Family Library under the same Family group.
