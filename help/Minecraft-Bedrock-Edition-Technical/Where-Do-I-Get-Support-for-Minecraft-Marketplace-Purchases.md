If you are playing a downloaded piece of content from the Minecraft Marketplace and notice an issue, you can submit feedback directly to the creator.

1.  Open Marketplace from the Minecraft launch screen.
2.  Search Marketplace by using the content name or creator name.
3.  Click **Submit Feedback** on the Marketplace page dedicated to that content.
4.  Provide a detailed description of the problem you encountered, including how to recreate it, so the creator can troubleshoot.

**Note:** The feedback button only appears for content you have downloaded. The feedback button is only available in Marketplace and will not appear in the Dressing Room.

If you are having issues with Minecoins, accessing your purchased content, or Marketplace Pass and Realms Plus content, contact Minecraft Support.
