## Loading Screen Crashing Windows 10 N 32-bit 

With the release of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Version 1.16.200 we have seen occasional issues with crashing on the loading screen when using Windows 10 N 32-bit. For anyone using that version of Windows and experiencing crashes, we have a fix for you! 

It is as simple as downloading and installing the Media Feature Pack: 

1.  Press the **Win+R** keys to open Run, enter **winver*** *into the box, and then select **OK**. A new About Windows window will list your Windows version information.

2.  Make a note of your Windows version listed at the top of this box. 
3.  Open the [Media Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack) article. 
4.  Select the correct download for your version of Windows and install. 

For example: In the screenshot below, the Windows version is 21H1; this user would follow the instructions in [**KB3145500**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3145500) (listed in the article to follow this KB if your version is not listed)
