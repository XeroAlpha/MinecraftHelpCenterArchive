If you are interested in trying out new Minecraft features before they are publicly released, consider trying out Preview! To learn how, see [How To Install Minecraft Preview](./How-to-Install-Minecraft-Preview.md).

## Essential Information Before Participating in Minecraft Preview

- Bedrock Editions of the game have a version called Minecraft Preview for testing features ahead of time. On Android, this version is called Beta.
- Preview is exclusive to Bedrock. To learn about testing pre-release Java features, see [Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshot FAQ](../Minecraft-Java-Edition-Technical/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Snapshot-FAQ.md).
- You will only have access to Preview Realms if you have an active Realms subscription. Normal Minecraft Realms are not available when playing in Minecraft Preview.
- To play with friends in Preview, everyone must be enrolled in Preview.
- Preview builds will likely be unstable and are not representative of the final version quality. Please back up your Worlds before joining Minecraft Preview. 
- Finished releases may not include all changes and fixes from Preview to preserve stability and may slip to a later release. 
- Report bugs to the [Mojang Bug Tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa) and all feedback to[ Minecraft Feedback](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us).
