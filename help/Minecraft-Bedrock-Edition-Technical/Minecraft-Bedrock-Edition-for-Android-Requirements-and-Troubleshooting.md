This article provides Android technical support processes for you to follow as well as general knowledge about Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on Android devices.

## What are the minimum specifications to play Minecraft?

Below are the current minimum specs for Minecraft on your Android or Amazon device as of February 2024.

**Android Devices**

- Operating System: Android OS 8
- Memory: More than 1GB of RAM
- Storage: 1 GB or higher
- Graphics: OpenGL ES 3 or higher

**Amazon Devices**

- Operating System: Fire OS 7
- Memory: More than 1GB of RAM
- Storage: 1 GB or higher
- Graphics: OpenGL ES 3 or higher

## My device is still supported, but I have performance problems. What can I do?

If you are on a device that meets the above specs and are still experiencing issues, these solutions may help improve stability:

- Upgrade to the most recent version of the Android operating system (OS)
- In the Settings menu: 
  - Reduce the Render Distance in the Video section from the default of 20 to 16. You can try going lower if necessary.
  - Change the Graphics setting to Fast. This reduces graphic resolution quality but enables the device to render faster.   
  - Change the Clouds setting to Off.
  - Change the Particles setting to Decreased or Minimal. This removes particle effects like smoke.   
- If you have additional programs running in the background on the device, pause or exit those programs to free up more processing power for Minecraft. 

**Note: Playing the game on an older version of the operating system may impact your gameplay experience with continued performance issues. It’s highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version of the OS. **

## My device is no longer supported. What can I do?

Devices with 1 GB or less of RAM, lower than OpenGL ES 3.0, or Android OS 7 (Nougat) or lower will no longer receive updates. You may be able to run the game but could experience higher rates of crashing or other performance issues.

For Minecraft Realms on OS 7 (Nougat) or lower devices, your Realm subscription can remain active for up to six months post-sunset. Within this timeframe, you can access the Realm on an OS 8 (Oreo) or above device, back-up the world on a local storage device, or cancel your subscription through your Google Play account.
