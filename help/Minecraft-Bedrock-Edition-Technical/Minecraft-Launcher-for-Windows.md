## General Questions 

### What is the Minecraft Launcher for Windows? 

A new launcher available in the Microsoft Store that allows you to launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, Minecraft: Java Edition, and Minecraft Dungeons from the same location. 

### Do I need the Minecraft Launcher for Windows to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, Minecraft: Java Edition, Minecraft Dungeons, or Minecraft Legends? 

You don’t need to use this launcher, but it will help you save time by having all your Minecraft games accessible from one location. 

### Where do I get the Minecraft Launcher for Windows?  

You can download it from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/Minecraft-Launcher/9PGW18NPBZV5). 

### Where do I install the Launcher?

For the time being, please install the Launcher on your C: Drive to avoid any potential issues.

### If I already own one or more of the games on the Microsoft Store, can I use the new Launcher? 

Yes! It’s been designed to consolidate all your existing and future Minecraft games in one place. Just click on the link above to download the new Launcher and get mining. 

### Is the Minecraft Launcher for Windows free? 

The launcher itself is free, but you will need to purchase the games individually in order to play them. 

### Does the Minecraft Launcher for Windows automatically give me access to all games? 

No, you still need to purchase Minecraft individually. Remember, due to the [Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6657208607501) bundle, you gain access to both Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition with one purchase. You can also subscribe to Xbox Game Pass for PC or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to gain access to Minecraft: Java Edition, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, and Minecraft Dungeons. 

### What platforms will the Minecraft Launcher for Windows run on?  

Windows 10, version 1903 (May 2019 Update) or newer. 

### What's the difference between the Minecraft Unified Launcher and the Minecraft Launcher for Windows? 

The Minecraft Unified Launcher only launches Java Edition and Minecraft Dungeons and was made for Windows 7/8. The Minecraft Launcher for Windows will launch those titles and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, and it works on both Windows 10 and Windows 11. 

### How is Minecraft Dungeons different being on the Minecraft Launcher for Windows? 

If you purchased Minecraft Dungeons through either the Microsoft Store or minecraftdungeons.net, the purchase entitlements for the game and any owned downloadable content (DLC) packs can be accessed on both the Minecraft Launcher for Windows and the old Minecraft Launcher. Be sure you are signed in using your Microsoft Account that owns Minecraft Dungeons in order to play. 

### Will Minecraft Education be available in the Minecraft Launcher for Windows? 

No, Minecraft Education uses its own launcher. More on Minecraft Education can be found here: [Minecraft Official Site \| Minecraft Education](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/homepage)

### Will Minecraft Story Mode be available through this launcher? 

No, Minecraft Story Mode is no longer being developed or supported. 

### I play Java Edition and received a Minecraft for Windows code several months/years ago. How is this different from that? 

The Minecraft for Windows codes are good for one copy of Minecraft when redeemed through the Windows Store. This new launcher does not come with a copy of the game but instead is a method of accessing your copy of Minecraft. 

**Note: **

### Do I need to uninstall the old launcher? 

You do not need to uninstall the old launcher (Minecraft Unified Launcher) but we strongly recommend doing so to cut down on confusion. If you want to uninstall the old launcher, see our guide for [Uninstalling the Old Minecraft Unified Launcher.](./Uninstalling-the-Old-Minecraft-Unified-Launcher.md) 

## Account Questions 

### Do I need a Microsoft account to use the Minecraft Launcher for Windows? 

Yes, you will need a Microsoft account to download the new Launcher from the Microsoft Store. 

### How do I sign into my account(s)? 

You can sign in using your Microsoft account. If you need help with your Microsoft account login, please contact [Xbox support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/). 

### I have a question about the Microsoft account migration. 

We have answers available on our [Minecraft: Java Edition Account Migration FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Account-Migration-FAQ). 

### How do I switch between my Microsoft accounts to play my games? 

You can click your username in the top left corner. From the drop down, select **Switch Account**. This will bring up a new window allowing you to sign into another Microsoft account. If multiple accounts have been added, this button will allow you to switch between them. You can also open **Settings** and look under the **Accounts** tab. This will also allow you to switch accounts or add new ones. Please note that you can only be signed in to one Microsoft account at a time. 

### I don’t see my games or a “Play” button to press; how can I play?

You may be signed in to different Microsoft accounts in the Store and Launcher. You will need to make sure you’re signed in to the Microsoft Store using the *same account* that you’re using to sign-in to the Minecraft Launcher; [Click here](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/Minecraft-Launcher/9PGW18NPBZV5) to go to the Store and review or update the active account. You will find the account (or an option to sign in if you are not currently) on the top left of the page. 

## Technical Questions 

### How do I update the Minecraft Launcher for Windows? 

When a new update is available you will be prompted to update. To manually update you can check the launcher’s settings.

### Are there beta versions of the Minecraft Launcher for Windows I can get access to? 

If you have the Minecraft Launcher for Windows installed, you can go to settings and check the box labelled “Use beta version of the launcher.”

### Will my Minecraft: Java Edition profiles/installations transfer to the new Launcher?

If your profiles/installations have not copied over, please follow these steps:

1.  Open the %appdata%/.minecraft folder
2.  Create a copy of launcher_profiles.json
3.  Delete launcher_profiles_microsoft_store.json
4.  Rename the copied version of launcher_profiles.json to launcher_profiles_microsoft_store.json

### How can I make a Desktop shortcut for the Minecraft Launcher for Windows?

Open the **Xbox App for PC**. On the right hand side, you will see icons for the titles you own. Right click on the Launcher icon and select 'Create  desktop shortcut'.

**![blobid0.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4412842377485)**

If you are unable to create the Desktop shortcut from the Xbox App for PC, you can follow these steps:

1.  Press **Windows key + r**
2.  Type shell:AppsFolder and hit enter
3.  Find the new Minecraft Launcher for Windows
4.  Right click on it and select 'Create shortcut'**  
    **

### What happens to my current save files for Minecraft Dungeons?

The new launcher will automatically detect your save files. Once you log in to the new launcher you should be able to pick up right where you left off.

For Minecraft Dungeons, this data is located in %HOMEPATH%\Saved Games\Mojang Studios\Dungeons by default.

For Java Edition, the new launcher also uses the exact same data in your .minecraft folder, so all of your saves and worlds etc will carry over. If you change a setting in .minecraft, both launchers, new and old, will detect that change.

Bedrock will experience no changes, but the default save location is %LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds

### I'm having a problem with the Minecraft Launcher for Windows. Can you help?

Contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support) with a detailed description of your issue. Please include screenshots where applicable.

### Where do I report bugs I find in the Minecraft Launcher?

Please search for bugs you’ve discovered at <https://aka.ms/MCBugTrackerHelp>.

### Is the Beta version of the game available in the launcher?

For Minecraft Bedrock Edition, currently only the published versions of the game are available.

For Minecraft: Java Edition, you are able to play on older releases and new snapshots.

### Does this mean players on Java and Bedrock can cross-play?

No, crossplay between Java Edition and Bedrock is not supported.

### Will my mods carry over to the new launcher?

If you use launcher or game mods, you will need to migrate them to the new Minecraft Launcher for Windows’ installation location before you uninstall your old launcher. Please check with your mod developer for more detail.
