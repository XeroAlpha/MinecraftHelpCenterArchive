This article details PlayStation technical support and information that can help you with any PlayStation technical issues.

**Note: If you have a PlayStation 5, you're still playing the PlayStation 4 version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Please keep in mind that all information in this article still applies if you're playing on PlayStation 5.**

## Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and PlayStation*®* Versions

### Transfer from PS3™ to PS4™/Vita

*The PlayStation® editions version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition were developed by 4J Studios, and support is provided by PlayStation*®*. For help with your PlayStation*® *games, purchases, accounts, or hardware, please contact* [*PlayStation® Support*](https://www.playstation.com/get-help/)*.*

As of April 15, 2020, transfer of worlds from PS3**™** or PSVita to PS3**™**, PSVita, or PS4**™** is no longer supported. Please see [Enjoy Saving Your PlayStation Game](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/enjoy-saving-your-playstation-game-).

Expired update offer: As of February 25, 2016, the following upgrade offer and the downloadable content (DLC) content transfer offers are no longer available: If you purchased Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition digitally or played online with the disc version, you can upgrade to PlayStation 4 Edition for \$4.99. If you already own Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition, you get the PS Vita version for free. Log into the PlayStation***®*** Store to upgrade.

### What is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition?

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition refers to any current non-Java edition of the game. 

- Multi-Platform – You can play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on Minecraft console, mobile and PC 
- Marketplace – Add-Ons or Skin packs can be purchased from the marketplace to change your gameplay experience 
- Cross-Play – Minecraft: Bedrock Edition players can play with any other Bedrock players online 
- Runs Smooth – Minecraft: Bedrock Edition does not require powerful computers or devices to run and will often run more smoothly than Java Edition 
- Controls – Minecraft: Bedrock Edition has the option to switch to a controller for movement or touch controls if on a mobile device 
- Moderation and Parental Controls – Since Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is connected to Xbox’s services, the online experience is more heavily moderated and parental controls can be finer tuned.

### How is this version different than the one I already own? 

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition delivers a unified experience to players on all platforms that use the Bedrock codebase. You can cross-play with friends no matter what device they’re using, play multiplayer mini-games, and customize how you play with community content available through the in-game Minecraft Marketplace/Minecraft Store. 

### When did this launch? 

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition launched on PS4™ on December 10th, 2019. If you already own the game, you’ll receive a patch update that will give you Minecraft: Bedrock Edition at no additional cost. 

### Do I need to pay a subscription fee like Xbox Game Pass Core, to play online? 

Online subscription fees are determined by the platform you play on, so an Xbox Game Pass Core subscription is not required for PlayStation® players, but a PlayStation® Plus subscription is required for multiplayer. A free Microsoft account is optional but recommended for players to get the most out of this version of Minecraft. 

### I already own a Minecraft: PS4™ Edition. How do I get the current version?

Players who already own Minecraft: PS4™ Edition will receive the new version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition at no additional cost. Update your game with the latest patch and follow the instructions within the patch notes. 

### Will my copy of Minecraft: PS4™ Edition go away? Do I have to use the new one?

Minecraft: PS4™ Edition will no longer be available to purchase, but people owning that edition can continue to play it. It will remain available as an option to choose from the in-game main menu. 

**Note: There will be no further updates to Minecraft: PS4™ Edition.**  

## Account Information

**Note: As of March 15, 2023, please DO NOT unlink your MSA from your PlayStation account via the in-game menu. You will be unable to link it back if you do so.**

### What’s a Microsoft account and why do I need it for PS4<sup>TM</sup>?

A Microsoft account is not required to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on PS4™ or PS5™. However, having one does allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition players on PS4™ or PS5™ to play with other players on non-PS4™ devices like Android, iOS, Switch, Windows 10, and Xbox One.

### What is a Microsoft account?  

It’s a free account that’s used to verify your access to computers and Microsoft services and applications. Your Microsoft account lets you manage everything all in one. If you use any of these services, you have a Microsoft account:

|                    |                  |
|--------------------|------------------|
| ·<u>Xbox Live</u>  | ·<u>Store</u>    |
| ·<u>Outlook</u>    | ·<u>Bing</u>     |
| ·<u>Office</u>     | ·<u>Windows</u>  |
| ·<u>Skype</u>      | ·<u>MSN</u>      |
| ·<u>OneDrive</u>   |                  |

Having a Microsoft account also enables the portability of your Marketplace (devices other than PS4) or Minecraft Store (PS4™) purchases to other devices and platforms.

## Linking a Microsoft account to a PlayStation account

**WARNING:** Once a Microsoft account has been linked to a PlayStation account, neither the Microsoft account nor the PlayStation™ Network account can be associated with a different account. 

If you choose to unlink accounts, then purchases will be returned to the account which made the purchase. **Even after unlinking, Microsoft and PlayStation accounts can only be re-linked to the original account.**

If you believe that your Microsoft account or PlayStation™ Network account have been linked incorrectly, contact [Minecraft support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).

### I have a Microsoft account; how do I sign in on my PS4™ or PS5™?

**WARNING: Be certain you use the account details for the Microsoft account you want associated with your PlayStation™ Network account.**

Once a Microsoft account has been linked to a PlayStation™ Network account, neither the Microsoft account nor the PlayStation™ Network account can be associated with a different account. 

You will not be able to link another Microsoft account to your PlayStation account. 

### Sign in to PS4™ or PS5™ with your Microsoft Account

- On the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition home screen, click **Sign in with a Microsoft account**. 
- Follow the instructions on the page to go to <http://aka.ms/remoteconnect> to enter the unique 8-digit code and complete your sign-in. 

### How do I find my friends on their Microsoft accounts?

- Sign in to your Microsoft account and click **Play** on the home screen.
- Tab to the right to reach the **Friends** tab. 
- Click **Add Friend**. 
- Find friends by entering their Microsoft Gamertag in the **Search** box. 

### Why can’t I find my friend’s Gamertag?

Make sure you are entering your friend’s Gamertag correctly. 

**Note: You may only enter a Microsoft Gamertag as a player ID. Player IDs from other platforms are not supported at this time.  **

### How many Microsoft accounts can you tie to your PlayStation<sup>TM</sup> Network account?

You can only tie one Microsoft account to a PlayStation™ Network account.  

### What happens when I unlink my Microsoft account?

**IMPORTANT:**  Once a Microsoft account has been linked to a PlayStation™ Network account, it **cannot** be unlinked without loss of access to entitlements and Minecoins on other platforms. 

### Why can’t I connect accounts?

Sometimes players attempting to link their Microsoft Account to their PSN™ ID encounter errors. There are two common error messages players see:

## Login and Lag Issues

### “Failed to login—scenario one”

When you see this error message, it means that the Microsoft account is already connected to another account on the PlayStation™ Network.

![mceclip0.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409130267917)

 

![mceclip1.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409130290189)

The solution is to link the PSN™ ID to a different Microsoft account since the Microsoft Account you’re attempting to use is already connected to a different PSN™ ID. Each Microsoft account may only be linked to a single PSN™ ID and vice versa.

### “Failed to login—scenario two”

When you see this error message, it means that the PSN™ ID you're attempting to link from is already connected with a Microsoft Account. 

![mceclip2.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409127206541)

 

![mceclip3.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409130324877)

That’s good news! This error message tells you which Microsoft account the PSN™ ID is connected to. The solution is to sign in with the correct listed account. For example, in the image, you would sign in with the account **MyOtherMSAccount** where that “other account” is your other account name.

### Issues with Lagging or Crashing for PlayStation 4<sup>TM</sup> or PS5™

If you are experiencing any issues with lagging, crashing, or hanging on the PS4™ or PS5™ platforms, you may be able to solve your issue with a full restart. 

- Fully restart your console from the power options in settings.  
- Select and launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition without opening other games or apps.  

**Note**: **If this does not solve your issue, for a temporary workaround, try not signing into a Microsoft account. While you won't have access to servers, Realms, or possibly Marketplace content, you can play single-player & split-screen worlds.**

### You are out of Local Data Storage Issue

If you're on PlayStation and the message "You are out of local data storage and unable to save your progress" is displayed, this is a bug. We are working to rectify this issue. Please head to the [bug report page](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-55010) for this issue for more information.

If you still have issues with gameplay performance, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).

## Gameplay

### Do my existing worlds transfer? 

Yes, your existing worlds from Minecraft: PS4™ Edition will convert to the new version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. 

**Note: Worlds on PS3™ will need to be converted to PS4™ and opened in Minecraft: PS4™ Edition first, to ensure that the worlds transfer over properly. **

### How do I transfer existing worlds? 

#### Transfer existing worlds from Minecraft: PS4™ Edition to Minecraft 

1.  In Minecraft: Bedrock Edition navigate to the **Play** menu.
2.  In the **Worlds** list, click **Sync Old Worlds** at the bottom of the worlds list in the play menu. This will let you find any worlds on the device from Minecraft: PS4™ Edition and display them below the button. 
3.  Select any of the worlds to convert them to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
4.  After the conversion, you’ll see the world(s) listed along with the rest of your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition worlds. 

### Copying a World Save from PlayStation to USB

Here are the steps to copy a world save on PlayStation:

1.  Make sure your BLANK USB stick has been formatted to FAT32
2.  On your PlayStation, go to Settings \> Application Saved Data Management \> Saved Data in System Storage \> Copy to USB Storage Device \> Select Minecraft \> Select Saved World to copy \> Copy
3.  This should then copy the world save to the USB, which you can share to a file sharing site such as OneDrive, and then share the link.

### Cloud Saves/Backups

If you pay for PlayStation Plus, you can backup your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition saves in case of a local failure. To learn how to best utilize cloud saves and backups, read the official PlayStation documentation:

- PlayStation 5 cloud saves/backups: [PlayStation Plus cloud storage for PS5 consoles](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/subscriptions/ps5-ps-plus-cloud-storage/)
- PlayStation 4 cloud saves/backups: [PlayStation Plus online storage for PS4 consoles](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/subscriptions/ps4-ps-plus-online-storage/)

### How big are worlds in Minecraft for PS4™?

Minecraft worlds are now expanded, World Types are all Infinite, and there are no longer any world borders within the world. 

### I’m playing in a world that was transferred from the previous version. Are there limitations on world size? 

Transferring to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition should change the World Type to Infinite, keeping the portions of the world from the previous Minecraft: PS4™ Edition the same, but generating new chunks outside of that area. 

### Can I connect to a custom server not in the server list? 

Due to console platform policy, you cannot connect to a server that is not in the servers list.  

### I have a custom skin on another Minecraft: Bedrock Edition platform. Can I use it on a PS4™ or PS5™?

Yes, if the custom skin was created with the in-game Character Creator. If you uploaded the custom skin to your device, it will not transfer to your PS4™ or PS5™ system. This is the same for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch players. 

## Minecraft for PSVR

### Does Minecraft: Bedrock Edition support PlayStation®VR?

Yes, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is supported on PlayStation**®** VR.

### How do I get Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PlayStation VR?

Anyone that owns Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PlayStation® 4 and a PlayStation<sup>®</sup> VR kit can play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in VR at no additional cost.

Everyone who has Minecraft on PlayStation® 4 will get the update automatically when it launches. Download that update and you’ll get access to the new Minecraft VR functionality.

Please review and follow all safety guidelines for use of PlayStation VR. PlayStation VR is not for use by children under the age 12.

### Can I play in VR with other players that are not in VR?

Yes. Since PlayStation VR support is a free update with the current version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, you can play multiplayer normally even if others are not playing in VR.

### Is Minecraft Store content, such as worlds and texture packs, playable in VR?

Yes, content purchased from the Minecraft Store can be played in VR.  However, some content is not optimized for VR and some worlds may experience camera issues because of the VR camera.

### Can you explain the different settings?

#### Living Room Mode

When entering the game, you are placed in a static environment. The viewpoint is still VR, and you can look around the room, but the gameplay is fixed on the virtual screen in front of you.

You can play the game entirely in this mode with access to all features, or toggle Immersive Mode by pressing D-pad.

#### Immersive Mode

In Immersive Mode you assume the player’s viewpoint, allowing you to play as if you are in the world itself. You can return to the Living Room at any time by pressing D-pad again.

Immersive Mode has a number of options to help reduce motion sickness.

#### Center Cursor

When this setting is enabled, your cursor will always snap to the center of the living room screen.

#### Camera Movement

- **Snap:** Turn by periodic steps. This option is recommended for players new to VR experiences.
- **Classic:** Move your camera freely.
- **Wheel:** Turn by rotating Right Stick in a circle.
- **Snap Wheel:** Turn in pre-determined angles by rotating Right Stick in a circle.

#### Snap Angle

When the Snap camera movement option is selected, this slider allows you to choose the size of each camera movement.

#### Variable Snap Angle

When the Snap camera movement option is selected, this toggle controls the size of each camera movement based on how far you push Right Stick.

#### Snap Sound

When the Snap camera movement option is selected, this toggles on or off a sound playing when the camera direction changes.

#### Movement

- **Linear:** When turned on, your velocity is constant with all acceleration/deceleration disabled.
- **Classic:** The player accelerates/decelerates normally.

#### Jump

- **Linear:** All acceleration/deceleration is removed from the jump. The jump height is also reduced so that it is the same height as a block instead of slightly higher.
- **Classic:** The player jumps normally.

#### Immersive Mode Auto-Jump

When enabled, Auto-Jump is turned on only when in Immersive Mode. This option does not affect Living Room play.

#### Head Steering

- **Follow Gaze:** The player's direction of motion follows your eye movement.
- **Follow Player Angle:** The direction of motion is independent of  
  your viewpoint.

#### Sticky Mining

- **Lock-On:** Mining will be locked to a specific block when you start mining.
- **Disabled:** The cursor moves freely in the environment as you shift your gaze while mining. It may interrupt mining if your gaze leaves the current block.

#### HUD Position

- **Drift:** The HUD is allowed to “float” for comfort.
- **Fixed:** The HUD is fixed on your screen.

#### HUD Distance

When in Immersive Mode, this slider allows you to control how far from the center of your vision the HUD displays.

## What are the differences between Living Room mode and Immersive mode?

![mceclip4.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409127484813)

In Living Room mode, when entering the game, you are placed in a static environment. The viewpoint is still VR, and you can look around the room, but the gameplay is fixed on the virtual screen in front of you. This mode is recommended for those players that experience motion sickness in VR.

![mceclip5.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409130548365)

In Immersive Mode you assume the player’s viewpoint, allowing you to play as if you are in the world itself. For this option, the player can customize the experience by adjusting VR Settings.

You can switch between the modes at any time.

## How do I toggle between Immersive mode and Living Room mode?

We have seen reports from players who are having trouble toggling between the two modes during gameplay.

First, ensure that you are playing Minecraft in VR Mode. While wearing your PlayStation®VR headset, go to the main menu and press the Triangle button to Enter VR Mode, if it isn’t already, then enter your world.

### Toggle between Immersive and Living Room modes

- Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and while wearing your PlayStation VR headset, on the main menu, press the triangle button to **Enter VR Mode**.
- Press the **Up** button on the D-pad to toggle between modes.

Did this work? If not, see the next section.

![mceclip6.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409130597005)

### Reset toggling between modes

- Go to **Settings**, and then click **Wireless Controller**.
- Next to **Toggle Perspective**, click the arrow button to reset the feature.

![mceclip7.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409127610765)

## Are PlayStation Move controllers supported?

PlayStation Move controllers are not supported; the system uses the DUALSHOCK®4 Wireless Controller.

## What settings can be adjusted to customize the VR experience?

We saw an opportunity to make the VR settings more customizable and intuitive. We increased the number of adjustments to maintain what current Minecraft VR players are experiencing while increasing the way the player can personalize that experience.

## How do I play split-screen without a PlayStation® Plus subscription?

Turn off Multiplayer in the Level settings prior to loading any account that is not PlayStation® Plus-enabled and before attempting to join in split-screen play. 

## I see a message that I don’t have enough storage to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on PlayStation® 4. What should I do?

We are investigating what might be causing this issue. As a workaround, you might want to try deleting any old worlds that you don't want to keep, and also try clearing cached content by going to **Settings\>Storage.**

## Downloadable Content, Minecraft Store and More

### Will downloadable content I own transfer over to the new version of Minecraft? 

Most existing downloadable content is transferable from Minecraft: PS4™ Edition to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. However, some content may not be available to use on the new version and some content may only be used on your PS4™. 

### What is the Minecraft Store? 

The Minecraft Store, accessible from in-game, is where players can purchase character skins, textures, and worlds. With Minecraft Store, we've made it safer and easier to purchase community-made content for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Content purchased while signed in with a Microsoft account can be enjoyed on any device and will not expire.  

### What are Tokens?

Purchasable with real currency in the Minecraft Store, Tokens let you buy content from creators in our store safely and securely on your PS4™ or PS5™. Tokens are kept in your virtual wallet which can only be used on your PlayStation™ account. 

### Can I use my Minecoins on PS4™ and PS5™?

No, but you can continue using your Minecoins on non-PS4™ Bedrock platforms. Content purchased on other platforms, unless the content is restricted to a particular platform, may be used on your PS4™ or PS5™. 

### How do I link my previous purchased on other Minecraft: Bedrock Editions to my PS4™ or PS5™ game?

Log into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and sign in to your Microsoft account. All Marketplace/Minecraft Store items will sync automatically with other purchases you’ve made on other Minecraft: Bedrock Editions if those purchases were made while logged in to that same Microsoft account and are purchases that can roam to PS4™ or PS5™.  

### I own Minecraft: PS4™ Edition and I’ve bought previous downloadable content. How do I get it to sync to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition? 

Log into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on your PS4™ or PS5™ and the content will automatically sync that downloadable content in the latest version.  

### Does Minecraft for PS4™ and PS5™ support mouse and keyboard input?

Yes.

### Will you be running beta versions in Minecraft for PS4™ and PS5™?

There are no plans around public beta programs for future updates to share at this time.

### Can players unlock Xbox achievements in Minecraft for PS4™ and PS5™?

Since PlayStation already has its own award system, players can unlock Trophies.

### If I download the update, can I revert to the prior update?

No, but if you want to keep playing Minecraft: PS4™ Edition, it is an option you can choose from the first screen. If you choose Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and want to revert to PS4™ Edition, you can choose this from the in-game menu.

### Does the update reset your trophies?

No; your trophy status is maintained and new trophies from Minecraft: Bedrock Edition will be added. However, you can only migrate progress toward unlocking trophies from PS4™ Edition to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition once.
