## Xbox One: How to Fix Error 0x82d40003  

Customers who have purchased Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Xbox One sometimes see the error code 0x82d40003. Error 0x82d40003 occurs when there is an issue validating ownership of the game.

Occasionally the related error 0x803f8001 displays too; it is also related to issues when the Xbox Service attempts to validate game rights. These can usually be resolved through solutions in the following troubleshooting guide.  

### Power Cycle Your Xbox   

Sometimes this issue is resolved by power cycling your Xbox.    

-   On your console, press and hold the Xbox Logo until the console powers down (approximately 10 seconds).   
-   Unplug your Xbox from the power socket and wait 15 seconds.   
-   Plug your Xbox back into the outlet and press the Xbox Logo on either your console or paired controller.   
-   Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.    

## Sign In with the Account that Purchased the Game or Insert the Game Disc   

The game must be validated through either the game disc or while the account that purchased the game is logged in.  Check the disc to ensure that it is free of lint or scratches. Check your internet connection and [status of the Xbox Live Services](https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status) at this time, as interruption of either may interfere with the validation process. 

## Verify Your Home Console  

If you are playing from an account that did not make the original purchase, such as while sharing with family members on the same console, ensure that each account has the same Xbox One set as the "Home Console."  This is typically the default setting, but to verify, follow the steps below.   

**Note: Start with the account that purchased Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and repeat for each account that plays from the same console:   **

1.  Press the Xbox Logo on your controller to open the guide.   
2.  Go to System and then navigate to Settings \> General \> Personalization \> My Home Xbox.   
3.  You can check your home console settings from this page.   

## Remove and Re-Add Affected Accounts from Your Xbox One   

### Remove the account from your Xbox   

1.  Press the Xbox logo on your controller.   
2.  Go to System, and then navigate to Settings \> Account \> Remove Accounts.    
3.  Select and confirm the account to remove.   

### Add the account back to Xbox    

1.  Press the Xbox logo on your controller.   
2.  Select the Gamerpic in the upper left and choose **Add New**.    
3.  Enter the email address and password associated with your Microsoft account.   
4.  After reading and accepting the Microsoft Service Agreement and Privacy Setting, set up your account to finish this process. \

### Uninstall and Reinstall Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

Follow the instructions in the article below to uninstall and reinstall Minecraft: Bedrock Edition:

## Transfer Minecraft Worlds on Xbox Consoles 

**Note: It's not possible to transfer a world directly from Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition to the newer version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Xbox One. To do this, you must first transfer the world to Xbox One Edition and then to the newer bedrock version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Xbox One. For more information on the differences, see [Different Minecraft Editions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034753992-Different-Minecraft-Editions). **

### How do I transfer my saved worlds from Xbox 360 to Xbox One Edition? 

You'll need to make sure you have the latest update for Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition by starting the game while connected to Xbox Live. The most recent update contains a feature that lets you upload one saved world at a time to a save transfer slot.

You can then use the Xbox 360 save download feature on Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition to download that world. You'll need to download that save to your Xbox One before you can upload a new save using your Xbox 360. You can do this as often as you like, but you can transfer only one saved world at a time. 

### How do I transfer my saved worlds from Minecraft Xbox One Edition to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Xbox One? 

You'll need to make sure you have the latest update to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition by starting the game while connected to Xbox Live. Choose **Play** and navigate down to the bottom, where you will find the **Sync Old Worlds** button. Select this button and choose the world you would like to transfer. You can do this as often as you like, but you can transfer only one world at a time. 

If you experience any issues with transferring worlds, contact [Xbox Support](http://xbox.com/support).
