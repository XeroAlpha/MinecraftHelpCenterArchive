## Can I Turn Achievements on and off in Realms? 

If your Realm is set to **Creative mode**, achievements will be disabled for your world. Unfortunately, re-activating achievements is only possible if you have a backup from before **Cheats **or **Creative mode** was enabled. If no backups are available, then that world will remain without achievements enabled.
