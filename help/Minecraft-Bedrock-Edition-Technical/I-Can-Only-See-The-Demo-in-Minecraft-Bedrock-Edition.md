## What is the Demo in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition?

The demo, or trial, for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is a limited version of Minecraft for you to try out before buying.

The demo is restricted in a few of the following ways:

- 90 minutes of play.
- No online multiplayer, LAN, or Realms access.
- Access to Survival mode only.
- No ability to change World Seed or World Options.

Please buy the full version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition to remove these restrictions.

## I Can Only Play Demo Mode in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

If you're trying to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, but only have access to the Trial or Demo version, you might be signed into an account that does not own Minecraft. If you are on Xbox or PC and usually subscribe to Xbox Game Pass, ensure that your subscription is active.

If you're on PC and want to buy Minecraft, we now offer Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition in the same bundle! [Use this article](./I-Own-Minecraft-Java-or-Bedrock-Edition-for-PC-How-Do-I-Get-the-Other.md) to get started.
