Did you know that you can share your digital Minecraft games with your family members? This will allow multiple accounts, including child accounts, to access Minecraft without having to buy the game multiple times! Here is everything you need to know about how to download and play Minecraft with family share.

## How to set up family share on your PC

Before going through the process of trying to download Minecraft on your child’s account, be sure you have properly created a Microsoft child account for them and that they are [included in your family group](https://account.microsoft.com/family/home). For more info on how to set up and manage a child’s account in your family group, please visit [How to Manage Parental Consent](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition/Set-Up-Microsoft-Family-Accounts-for-Minecraft-multiplayer-games.md). After the child is properly part of your family group, do the following:

1.  Sign into the family organizer’s Windows profile on your device.
2.  Open Settings by typing it into the Windows search bar at the bottom of your screen.
3.  Select **Accounts**, then **Family & other users**. You will see the full list of family members within your family group.
4.  Click on every Microsoft child account profile that you want to allow to have access to your apps and select **Allow**.

## How to download Minecraft through family share with a child’s account

- Sign into the Windows child profile you want to use to play Minecraft.
- Open the Microsoft Store app and sign in with the Microsoft Account that purchased Minecraft (most likely the family organizer account).
- Search for [Minecraft Launcher](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4412261881229) and download it if it is not already installed on your device.
- If you want to make sure the child does not make purchases on your account, you can now sign out of the Microsoft Store app with that account.

- Open the Minecraft Launcher and sign into the child’s Microsoft account.
- Set Minecraft for Windows (or Dungeons/Legends if desired) to install if playing on a new device.
- Play and enjoy!

## Which games can be shared across family accounts?

Only games accessible from the Microsoft Store are eligible for family sharing including:

- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
- Minecraft Dungeons
- Minecraft Legends

Minecraft: Java Edition cannot be family shared because it is not part of the Microsoft Store. Only the main account that purchased the game can play it without buying it again. If the child account that is family sharing wants to play Java Edition, they will need to purchase Java Edition on their account directly or you can sign into the account that owns it already.
