## What is the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Editor?

An in-engine, multiblock experience that exists to improve the workflows of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition creators and make it possible for creators of all skillsets to easily craft high-quality experiences. The Editor is in early development and there is a lot of work ahead of us. We are sharing early because we want your help creating the experience.

**Note: Editor is not a new game mode. It is a tool to assist creators in their world-building workflows.**
