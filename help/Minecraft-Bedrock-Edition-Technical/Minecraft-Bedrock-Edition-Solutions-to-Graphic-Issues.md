This article helps you solve various graphical issues in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. See the [Error Code Troubleshooting page](./Error-Code-Troubleshooting-for-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) for other issues.

## Update Minecraft and your operating system

Before going into the game itself, try updating your operating system and Minecraft to ensure they are running the latest versions. If you have some Add-Ons installed, [consider disabling them](../Minecraft-Marketplace/Disabling-Minecraft-Add-Ons.md). After that, try the following:

## Recommended game settings

Below are various settings to try applying to your game. Find them by:

1.  Starting Minecraft.
2.  Click **Settings**.
3.  Go to the **Video** section.

Try the following settings to ease up the intensity on your system. Remember that your situation may vary, so be sure to experiment to see what works for you.

- Screen Animations: Off
- View Bobbing: Off
- Camera Shake: Off
- Fancy Leaves: Off
- Fancy Bubbles: Off
- Render Clouds: Off
- Beautiful Skies: Off
- Smooth Lighting: Off
- Fancy Graphics: Off
- Render Distance: 9 Chunks
- Max Framerate: 60
- Anti-Aliasing: 1

## Update your graphics card

Try updating your graphics card drivers if you’re experiencing graphical issues with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on PC. Below are common links:

- [AMD](http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx)
- [Nvidia](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
- [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)

After you download and install the drivers, you must restart your computer. If you still see the error message after this update, your computer may not meet the [system requirements to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Installation-Issues-FAQ.md#what-are-the-device-requirements-to-run-minecraft-bedrock-edition).

If you're still experiencing performance issues and have a dedicated graphics card (or GPU) in your computer, it may be that Minecraft is not using the dedicated GPU when it runs.

**WARNING:** Following the instructions linked below may cause changes to your system, files, settings, work, etc. that may be unexpected or irreversible and should only be undertaken by experienced users. Minimize the risks by backing up your files, settings, etc. before making changes.
