What does this mean for you? Well, if you’ve never bought Minecraft before, you can now get both Java and Bedrock for one low price, also called Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC.

If you *have* bought Minecraft before, you’re now getting the other edition for free. Woot! Follow these steps to redeem it:

1.  [Click here](https://aka.ms/JavaBedrockEdition) to go to the Microsoft Store listing for Minecraft: Java & Bedrock for PC.
2.  Sign-in to the Microsoft Store with your Microsoft account.

## How do I run or play either version of Minecraft?

Once you’ve completed the steps above, including logging into the Microsoft Store, you can now download the Minecraft Launcher.

## What are the Differences Between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition

There are quite a few differences between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition.

### Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is the Windows 10/11, mobile, and console version of the game.
- This version has access to Marketplace and Xbox-specific features like Xbox achievements and friend presence.
- All versions of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition are cross-compatible, and players can enjoy the game with one another through servers, LAN, and Realms.
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers, Realms, and worlds are incompatible with Minecraft: Java Edition.

### Minecraft: Java Edition

- Minecraft: Java Edition is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- This version of the game does not have access to Marketplace or Xbox-specific features.
- Java Edition provides access to custom servers, mods, and other player-made tweaks to the game. However, note that these features can make your version of Minecraft: Java Edition unstable. Please use caution when installing third-party add-ons.
- Minecraft: Java Edition is incompatible with any servers, Realms, or worlds available through Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

Congratulations! We hope you enjoy owning both versions of Minecraft. If you have any additional questions, read on to find an answer.

## Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC FAQ

### What is the Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC Product?

Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC is the same Minecraft you already know and love, only this time, one purchase includes both Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Each game version will remain separately accessible as they were before, you’ll now just *have access to both*.

### I already own Minecraft Bedrock or Minecraft: Java Edition. What does this product mean for me?

If you already own one version of Minecraft on a Microsoft Secured Account (MSA), then you’re entitled to the other version for free! Your current version of the game will remain unaffected.

### I already own both Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on my Microsoft Account. What does this change mean for me?

You can keep playing both games as you wish – though it’s still a good idea for you to click “Get” on the MS Store just to make sure you keep updates getting delivered as they come out.

### I already own both versions of Minecraft, but on different Microsoft Accounts. What should I do?

You’ll be granted the other version of Minecraft on both accounts.

### I don’t own either Minecraft version, but I play both on Game Pass. Will I be affected?

Game Pass players of either Minecraft edition will not be affected by this change. However, if you ever choose to buy Minecraft down the line, you’ll receive entitlements to both versions with one purchase.

### I have been playing Minecraft: Java Edition on Mac or Linux. Can I now play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition as well?

If you have registered your Minecraft: Java Edition account with a Microsoft account, you now also own Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. That said, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition only runs on a Windows 10/11+ device, not on a Mac/Linux/Win7-8 device. However, if you ever acquire a Windows 10/11 device, your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition entitlement will be waiting for play as well by signing in with that Microsoft account.

### I have a Minecraft: Java Edition or Minecraft: Bedrock Edition code or gift card to redeem. How do these work after the change?

The redemption process is the same. Simply head to redeem.microsoft.com and enter the code. Now, however, you’ll receive both versions of the game – not just the one you have a code for.

To clarify, **if you have a card or code for Java Edition** you can still redeem it and you will get both Java and Bedrock.

However, note that while you can redeem a Java Edition code from your account profile, a Bedrock Edition code will require you to head to [redeem.microsoft.com](https://redeem.microsoft.com/).

### I have Minecraft Bedrock Edition on Switch/Mobile/PlayStation/another platform besides PC, Mac or Linux. Do I get Java Edition for free?

Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC is only for the PC, Mac, and Linux platforms at the moment. This offer does not apply to consoles or other versions of Minecraft.

### I'm having trouble logging into or accessing Minecraft through the Launcher.

If you're having trouble logging into or accessing Minecraft through the Minecraft Launcher, double-check to ensure you're logged in with the MSA that owns Minecraft: Java and Bedrock Edition for PC. For other Launcher log-in issues, check out our [Launcher troubleshooting guide](./Minecraft-Launcher-Troubleshooting-Common-Issues.md). For more login help, you can [contact Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us).

### I family-share my account with my children. Will they get both versions of Minecraft?

No, only the account that purchased Java or Bedrock will have access to Java Edition. Family sharing will work for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

### Can a child account buy Minecraft: Java and Bedrock Edition with funds in their account?

A child account can use money associated with their MSA to buy Minecraft: Java and Bedrock Edition. Child accounts can also use these funds to request purchases that must be approved by a parent.

However, parents must both [add funds to their child's account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/add-money-to-your-family-member-s-microsoft-account-d2a4d821-4d8b-fe19-49f1-c21d51f18aa7) and establish [purchase authorization settings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/spending-limits-in-family-safety-f30d6801-165d-9f86-3fe7-063245c0449b) to allow the child account to make a purchase.
