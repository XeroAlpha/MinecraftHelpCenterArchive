Effective immediately, the Minecraft app in the Amazon store will no longer be available for non-Amazon devices.  

If you own an Amazon device such as a phone or tablet, you can still download the Minecraft app onto your device. If you own a non-Amazon Android, please download Minecraft through the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe).

-   If you purchased Minecraft and have signed in with your Microsoft account, you'll still have full access to any in-app purchases for non-specific platform content,\
    regardless of whether you download Minecraft again from a different app store.

Thank you for your cooperation, and please enjoy Minecraft on your non-Amazon devices via the Google Play Store moving forward!
