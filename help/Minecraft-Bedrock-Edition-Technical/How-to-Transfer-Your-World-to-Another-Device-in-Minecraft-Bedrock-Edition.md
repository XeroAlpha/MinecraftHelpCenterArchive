If you are playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, the easiest way to transfer that world to another device is to use Realms. You can use a Realms or Realms Plus subscription to do this. If you have not subscribed before, you can also use a free 30-day trial to move your world quickly. For more information about Realms, visit [How to Create a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](../Minecraft-Realms-Plus/How-to-Create-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).

After you get a Realms subscription, follow the steps below to move your world.

**How to transfer Bedrock worlds between devices using Realms**

1.  Start Minecraft on the device the world currently resides on
2.  Select **Play**
3.  Click the **pencil** icon In the **Realms** section at the top of your world list to enter the edit menu
4.  Select a world slot and press **Edit World. Note:** Backup your existing worlds or make sure to use an empty slot. See [Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms Backup FAQ](../Minecraft-Realms-Plus/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-Backup-FAQ.md)
5.  Select **Upload World** at the bottom of the **Game Settings** section
6.  Confirm you want to replace the world in the current slot and select the world you want transferred
7.  Now that your world is on the Realm, login to Minecraft on another device with your Microsoft account
8.  Go to the **Game Settings** menu that you were in before
9.  Scroll to the bottom and select **Download World**
10. After the download and import is complete, the world will appear in your non-Realms world list as a copy of the Realm name. Press the pencil icon if you want to rename the uploaded world.

If the above method does not work, ensure that both versions of Minecraft you are on have been fully updated to the latest version and that you are signing into the same Microsoft account on both games.

**Where can I find my Bedrock world files?**

If you are on PC and would rather manually move your Minecraft worlds between folders and USB drives, you can find your world files by doing the following:

1.  Press the **Windows key** and **R** simultaneously.
2.  Copy and paste **%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang** and press **Ok**.
3.  Open **minecraftWorlds**.

From here, you can manually backup and move your world folders. You can also export your worlds on PC in-game by doing the following:

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Click the **Edit World** icon next to the world you want to export.
4.  Scroll to the bottom of **Game Settings**.
5.  Select **Export World**.
