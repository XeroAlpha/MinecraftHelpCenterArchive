Parents and guardians can manage permissions on child accounts for social interactions in Minecraft games using either the [Xbox Settings for Privacy & online safety](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/user/settings/privacy-and-safety?rtc=1&activetab=main:privacytab) or through the [Xbox Family app](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/family-settings-app). Minecraft uses Microsoft and Xbox family safety features to manage parental controls even if you do not play Minecraft on an Xbox. To enable parental controls, you need to create parent and child accounts and then create a family group.

The statutory age for a child account is determined by where you live. See [List of countries or regions that have statutory age limits for children - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/list-of-countries-or-regions-that-have-statutory-age-limits-for-children-a7393f56-5107-44b1-be44-655589bdeb92) for information. If there isn't an adult account associated with the child account, the adult must make a Microsoft account and associate the already-created child account with it. Only parent accounts can modify settings.

## Create a Family Group using the Microsoft Family Safety website

1.  Visit the [Microsoft Family Safety](https://account.microsoft.com/family/home) homepage.
2.  Sign in with the parent’s account.
3.  Select **Create a family group**.
4.  Select **Add a family member**.
5.  Create a new child account or enter the child’s existing email account.
6.  Visit the [Privacy & Online Safety page](https://account.xbox.com/en-us/settings) to manage in-game settings for the child account.

## Create a Family Group using the Xbox Family Settings App

1.  Download the [Xbox Family app](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/family-settings-app) on your device.
2.  Sign in with the parent’s account.
3.  Select the green silhouette icon in the top right.
4.  Select **Add Child**.
5.  Select **Create new account** or **Add existing account**.
6.  Tap on the child account under Members to manage in-game settings.
