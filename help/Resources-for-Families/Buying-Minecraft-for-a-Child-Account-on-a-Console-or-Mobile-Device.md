If your child wants to play Minecraft on a game console or mobile device, you may need to create accounts for both you and your child, purchase Minecraft using the child account, and configure their account settings using that platform’s parental controls. Here’s an outline of the process with platform-specific links where you can learn more. If you want to buy Minecraft for an Xbox or personal computer, see [Buying Minecraft for a Child Account on Windows, MacOS or Linux](../Buying-Minecraft-Games/Buying-Minecraft-for-a-Child-Account-on-Windows-MacOS-or-Linux.md).

## STEP 1: Create an account for the platform

- Android: [Create a family on Google](https://support.google.com/families/answer/7103337)
- iOS (iPhone or iPad): [Set up Family Sharing](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108380)
- Nintendo Switch: [How can I create a child account?](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Account/About-Nintendo-Accounts/What-is-a-child-account-/How-can-I-create-a-child-account-/How-can-I-create-a-child-account-1177534.html?srsltid=AfmBOorKDl1xsHhAWuM1Y0uxhdorA0ZKThEt82AaQs5n4HII6MDSHy56)
- PlayStation: [How to set up family accounts on PSN](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/account/playstation-family-account-set-up/)

## STEP 2: Buy Minecraft for your child’s gaming platform

- [Minecraft on Google Play (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en_US)
- [Minecraft for iPhone or iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minecraft-dream-it-build-it/id479516143)
- [Minecraft for Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/minecraft-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOorfey7Q843a7_ADEhw4yvYXaJ-heJ6ggSRFZaCmVg-RdcqbHbEy)
- [Minecraft for PlayStation](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/212779)

## STEP 3: Configure settings for the platform’s parental controls and social settings

- Android: [Google's Parental Controls](https://safety.google/families/parental-supervision/)
- iOS (iPhone or iPad): [Apple Parental Controls for iPad & iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105121)
- Nintendo Switch: [Nintendo Parental Controls](https://www.nintendo.com/au/nintendo-switch-family/parental-controls)
- PlayStation: [PlayStation Parental Controls](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/parental-controls/)

## STEP 4: Add Microsoft account features

If you want to use Xbox /Microsoft family settings, you’ll also need to create a [Microsoft Family Group](./Set-Up-Microsoft-Family-Groups-for-Parental-Controls-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) and then [link or sign in using the Microsoft child account](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/29296773863181) on your gaming platform when your child plays Minecraft. Minecraft will adhere to whichever setting is more restrictive – either the Microsoft account or the built-in gaming platform system. See [Minecraft Resources for Parents and Guardians](../General-Safety/Minecraft-Resources-for-Parents-and-Guardians.md) to learn more about Microsoft child accounts and account settings parents can control.
