## General Information 

### What is Minecraft Dungeons?  

Developed by a dedicated, passionate team at Mojang Studios, Minecraft Dungeons is an action-adventure title set in the Minecraft universe and inspired by classic dungeon crawlers. Battle new-and-nasty mobs across action packed levels in either single player or up to four-person co-op multiplayer in this epic quest to defeat the evil Arch-Illager.

### How does combat work? 

Combat in Minecraft Dungeons takes place in real-time and places an emphasis on weapons, gear, and enchantments. We were very careful in tuning items in the game to accommodate unique fighting styles, with this flexibility being especially rewarding in co-op multiplayer. A wide variety of weapons can be customized with unique enchantments that are an asset in battle.

### Can characters be customized?  

There are no character classes in Minecraft Dungeons, your power and abilities are based entirely on what you have equipped at any given moment. Players can also select their appearance from a diverse range of skins.  

**Note: Character Creator skins and skins purchased from the Minecraft Marketplace cannot be used in Minecraft Dungeons.**

### Do missions change from one game to the next? 

Yes! Each mission in Minecraft Dungeons is a mix of procedural content and carefully crafted elements that tie into the mission's objectives and narrative. In other words, while parts of the mission stay the same, the paths, mobs, and treasure you find will be different every time you play it.
