## How to redeem 15 Days of Minecraft items

**Note:** The Dressing Room items associated with the 15 Days of Minecraft Anniversary are exclusive to Bedrock Edition. These Character Creator items do not work on Classic Skins. You will need to equip them to a skin made in the Character Creator.

## How to redeem the 15th anniversary cape

While the items above are exclusive to Bedrock, the 15th anniversary cape is available to players on both Bedrock and Java Editions.

4.  Sign in with the Microsoft account you use to play Minecraft.

6.  Equip the cape using the steps below.

If you’re playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, the cape will be in the Dressing Room. If you’re playing Minecraft: Java Edition, you can equip the cape in the Minecraft Launcher or on the [Change your Skin page on Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/mygames/editskin).

## How to equip a cape in Java Edition
