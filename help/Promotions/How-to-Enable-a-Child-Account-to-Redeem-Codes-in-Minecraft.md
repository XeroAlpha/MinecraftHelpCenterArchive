Microsoft Child Accounts for children under 9 years of age are not allowed to enter codes to receive items or DLC by design as a safety feature. To change this setting, have the family organizer follow the steps below on either the Xbox Family Settings app or an internet browser.

## Change Content Restrictions on Xbox Family Settings app

1.  On your phone, open the Xbox Family Settings app and sign into the family organizer’s account.
    - You can get it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxfamily) or [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xbox-family-settings/id1507406707).
2.  Click on your Child’s account.
3.  Click on **Content Restrictions**.
4.  Click **Allow content suitable for**.
5.  Select at least **Age 10**.

## Change Age Rating on a browser

1.  Go to the [Microsoft Family homepage](https://account.microsoft.com/family/home) and sign in with the family organizer’s account.
2.  Click on the child account.
3.  Click on **Settings**.
4.  Select the dropdown under **Age Rating** and set it to at least **10**.
5.  Select **Done**.

After the child’s account is set to at least age 10, they will be able to redeem codes.
