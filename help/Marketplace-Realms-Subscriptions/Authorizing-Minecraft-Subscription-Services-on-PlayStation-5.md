If you start a Minecraft Realms or Marketplace Pass subscription on the PS5 version of Minecraft, you need to authorize Minecraft as a trusted app to allow others to play in your Realms and to avoid losing access to your Realm or Marketplace Pass content on other devices after 30 days of inactivity. You only need to authorize Minecraft Subscription Services once to eliminate the need to sign into Minecraft on your PS5 every 30 days. To manage this authorization, do the following:

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Select **Account** underneath General.
4.  Select **Manage PlayStation Network Authorization**.
5.  Select **Accept and Continue**.
