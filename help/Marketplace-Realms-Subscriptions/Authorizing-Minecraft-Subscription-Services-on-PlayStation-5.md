If you have a Minecraft Realms or Marketplace Pass subscription on the PlayStation® 5 (PS5) version of Minecraft, you need to complete a one-time authorization of Minecraft as a trusted app to enable automatic renewal of your subscriptions. 

If you do not provide authorization, your subscription benefits will be marked as expired each month after billing until you sign into Minecraft on PlayStation 5 again. If you do not sign in again within 30 days of billing, your Realms and Marketplace Pass subscriptions will appear as expired. This means you won't have access to your Realms when playing on other platforms and other Realm members won't be able to join. You'll also lose access to your Marketplace catalog items on other platforms.

**To authorize Minecraft Subscription Services on your PS5:**

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Select **Account** underneath General.
4.  Select **Manage PlayStation Network Authorization**.
5.  Select **Accept and Continue**.
