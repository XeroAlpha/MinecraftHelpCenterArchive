If you have a Minecraft Realms or Marketplace Pass subscription on the PlayStation® 5 (PS5) version of Minecraft, you need to complete a one-time authorization of Minecraft as a trusted app to enable automatic renewal of your subscriptions. 

If you do not provide authorization and do not sign into Minecraft on your PS5 after each monthly billing, your Realms and Marketplace Pass subscriptions will appear as expired. This means you won't have access to your Realms when playing on other platforms and other Realm members won't be able to join. You'll also lose access to your Marketplace Pass catalog items on other platforms.

**To authorize Minecraft Subscription Services on your PS5:**

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Select **Account** underneath General.
4.  Select **Manage PlayStation Network Authorization**.
5.  Select **Accept and Continue**.
