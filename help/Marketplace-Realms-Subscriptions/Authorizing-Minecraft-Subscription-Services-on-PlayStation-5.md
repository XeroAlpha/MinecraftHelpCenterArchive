If you have a Minecraft Realms or Marketplace Pass subscription on the PS5 version of Minecraft, you need to authorize Minecraft as a trusted app to allow the game to renew your subscription when not online. If you do not provide authorization, your subscription benefits will be marked as expired each month after billing until you next login to Minecraft on PlayStation 5, meaning your Realm will appear expired to you when playing on other platforms, it will appear expired to your Realm members, and your Marketplace catalog will not be accessible on other platforms.

You only need to authorize Minecraft Subscription Services once to eliminate the need to sign into Minecraft on your PS5 every 30 days. To manage this authorization, do the following:

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Select **Account** underneath General.
4.  Select **Manage PlayStation Network Authorization**.
5.  Select **Accept and Continue**.
