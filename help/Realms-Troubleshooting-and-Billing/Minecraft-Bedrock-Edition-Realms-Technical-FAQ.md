Realms in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition can seem complex at first. This article provides everything you need to know about Realms’ more technical aspects.

# In this article:

## Can I upload my worlds onto a Realm?  

Yes, you can upload your own worlds to a Realm. We currently support worlds up to 4GB in size. That’s a substantial amount of allotted space! To upload one of your existing worlds to your Realm, click the pencil button next to the world on the Play screen. Then click **Play on Realm**.

To use a world template from the Minecraft Marketplace, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the pack of your choosing.
2.  Select **Create this World!**
3.  Adjust any settings as you’d like.
4.  Click **Create on Realm Server**
5.  Choose which Realm you’d like to place the world in
6.  Select a **World Slot** to place it in

## Do realms servers support modding? 

Realms servers support Add-Ons and Marketplace maps, textures, and skins, as well as the use of Character Creator items. However, full modding support is not available.    

## Are there any specific settings needed to play on a realm? 

Yes, your [Xbox Live account](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live) needs to have two settings enabled:

- Join Multiplayer games
- Additionally, if you want to participate in a Realm’s Stories, you will need to enable the “You can create and join clubs” setting.

**Note: Child accounts do not have these settings enabled by default, so if you have a child account you need parental consent to play on Realms.**

To change these settings, log in to your Xbox Live account on your Xbox console or at <http://account.xbox.com/settings>. For Xbox Live account assistance contact[ Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/). 

## How does Mojang backup your Realm?

A Realm world is downloadable within 18 months of the end of your subscription, but the world backups associated with that Realm may have been removed depending on our retention policy. In general, we take a backup every 30 minutes while you are playing, and at the end of a play session. We can’t keep all of your backups around forever, though. If a Realm world is used actively, the following retention policy is in effect: 

- In the last 24 hours: We retain all backups.
- 1 day to 8 days ago: We retain one backup per day.
- 9 days to 36 days ago: We retain one backup a week.
- 37 days to 121 days ago: We retain one backup a month.
- 122+ days ago: No backups are retained.

**Note: If you’d like to save a copy of your world indefinitely, we suggest you download your work to your local storage. Also, we keep the most recent backup within each given window above, meaning that as backups age they may move into the next window, which could result in an older backup being removed.**
