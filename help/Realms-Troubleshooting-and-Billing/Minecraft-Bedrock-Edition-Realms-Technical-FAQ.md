Realms in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition can seem complex at first. This article provides everything you need to know about Realms’ more technical aspects.

## Can I upload my worlds onto a Realm?  

Yes, you can upload your own worlds to a Realm. We currently support worlds up to 4GB in size. That’s a substantial amount of allotted space! To upload one of your existing worlds to your Realm, click the pencil button next to the world on the Play screen. Then click **Play on Realm**.

To use a world template from the Minecraft Marketplace, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the pack of your choosing.
2.  Select **Create this World!**
3.  Adjust any settings as you’d like.
4.  Click **Create on Realm Server**
5.  Choose which Realm you’d like to place the world in
6.  Select a **World Slot** to place it in

## Do realms servers support modding? 

Realms servers support Add-Ons and Marketplace maps, textures, and skins, as well as the use of Character Creator items. However, full modding support is not available.    

## Are there any specific settings needed to play on a realm? 

Yes, your [Xbox Live account](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live) needs to have two settings enabled:

- Join Multiplayer games
- Additionally, if you want to participate in a Realm’s Stories, you will need to enable the “You can create and join clubs” setting.

**Note: Child accounts do not have these settings enabled by default, so if you have a child account you need parental consent to play on Realms.**

To change these settings, log in to your Xbox Live account on your Xbox console or at <http://account.xbox.com/settings>. For Xbox Live account assistance contact[ Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/). 

## How does Mojang backup your Realm?
