As of September 26th, Minecraft: Java Edition Realms subscriptions are moving to the Microsoft Store. This means the payment processor (the company conducting the monthly payment for Minecraft) is changing from Braintree to the Microsoft Store.

This shift won’t alter your in-game experience, and you will still be able to see your Realms and purchase new ones on Minecraft.net just like before.

Once your subscription is set up on the Microsoft Store, you can manage the subscription on account.microsoft.com along with any other Microsoft subscriptions you have (like an Xbox or Windows 10 Bedrock Realms subscription, or your Game Pass subscription). We also link to account.microsoft.com from the Minecraft.net Realms list with the “Manage” button next to each Realm.

Migrating your subscription does require you to follow a few steps, so please read below to learn more about the process.

**Note: We are rolling this change out gradually. You might not see the payment shift on the 26th. Please wait a few weeks before contacting Minecraft Support. Also, we are offering 30 days free for each active Java Realms subscription that you move to the Microsoft Store! **

## How to move your Java Realms payments to the Microsoft Store

Please follow these steps to move your Java Realms payments to the Microsoft Store:

Log into your profile on [Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login) and navigate to the 'Wallet & Realms' section of your profile page.

Each of your active Java Realms billing through Braintree will show a purple “Transfer” button. Clicking on “Transfer” will ask you to agree to our EULA and Privacy Policy again – these terms are the same regardless of payment processor, so don’t worry.

Agreeing to these policies will allow you to start the transfer process. Click on the “Transfer” button once again.

A pop-up will appear. Please press the “Continue” button to stop your Realms subscription billing through Braintree and begin setting up a new Realms subscription on the Microsoft Store.

**Note: If you start the transfer, but don’t finish it, your old subscription will cancel. You won’t have a new one in its place. If this happens, your Realm will expire at the end of your billing period, but it will still be available to reactivate.  **

Next, you will be on a purchase screen where you may need to add a payment method to your Microsoft Store Account. You will get the first 30 days free after migrating your account. After that 30 day period, your payment method on file will be charged monthly.

Once you have entered a payment method, click “SUBSCRIBE”.

![Step 5.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/19751451202957)

Congratulations and thank you! You successfully transferred your Java Realms subscription to the Microsoft Store. 

![Step 6.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/19751434704909)

When you go back to your Realms list, you should no longer see the transfer button on that Realm.

![Step 7.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/19751475190413)

If you have multiple Realms, you will need to transfer each one individually. Once you have migrated all of your Realms, you may be prompted to remove your previous payment method. This is because our old payment system does not need to store that information anymore, as it is now stored in your Microsoft Store Account.  

**Note: We're aware of a payment processing issue in certain languages and we're working on a fix. If you're experiencing an issue with purchasing a Java Realms subscription in your current language, please try the process again in a different language.**

## Why are Java Realms payments moving to the Microsoft Store?

Other Microsoft subscriptions (such as Bedrock Realms and Game Pass payments) are already in the Store, so it’s easier for you to manage them all in one place.

**Note: We are rolling this change out gradually. You might not see the payment shift on the 26th. Please wait a few weeks before contacting Minecraft Support.**

## I’ve purchased a Java Realms subscription before the shift, but I haven’t set it up

If you’ve purchased a Java Realms subscription before the payment shift, but you haven’t set it up, you might be blocked from the payment migration process. To access the payment migration process, please set up your Realm. There is an in-game method to walk you through this.

Once your Realm is set-up, you can transfer it to the new payment process.

## Do I get anything for completing the Java Realms payment migration process?

We’re offering 30 free days of Java Realms if you complete the payment migration process.

## What happens to my worlds if my subscription expires?

We will not be deleting any worlds based on players failing to complete the payment migration process. Please refer to [this article](./Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realms-Billing-Issues-FAQ.md#h_01FGCSSR72S26SBJTE7EVVKN98:~:text=for%20further%20assistance.-,HOW%20DOES%20MOJANG%20BACKUP%20YOUR%20REALM%3F,-A%20Realm%20world) for more information on how we manage worlds past a Realm’s expiration date.
