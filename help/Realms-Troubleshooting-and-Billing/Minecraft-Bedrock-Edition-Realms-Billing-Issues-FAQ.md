*This article addresses billing issues for Realms Plus in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. See [Minecraft: Java Edition Realms Billing Issues FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4410000696077) for Minecraft: Java Edition Realms billing issues.*

**Note: A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms subscription is separate from a Minecraft: Java Edition Realms subscription.** **Realms subscriptions do not carry over between game versions. If you would like a Realm in Bedrock Edition and one in Java Edition, you need to set up two separate subscriptions. **

## Why are there two versions of Realms servers?   

We've developed two separate versions of Minecraft so that the game runs well on different platforms. Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, the version you find on mobile, console, Chromebook, and Windows 10 (and above) runs on one kind of code, and Minecraft: Java Edition (for PC, Mac and Linux) runs on another.  

These two versions are incompatible with each other and are developed separately with different features. Players on Minecraft: Java Edition can't play on console, mobile or Windows 10 (and above) Realms and vice versa.   

## Are there trials available for Minecraft Realms Plus?

We offer a free 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms to players who have not previously had a Realm and have signed up for a 10-user subscription. See our [Realms homepage](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/bedrock#:~:text=Visit%C2%A0Minecraft%20Marketplace%C2%A0in-game%20to%20purchase%20a%C2%A0Realms%20for%20Bedrock%20Edition%C2%A0or%C2%A0Realms,a%20new%20world.%20Now%20included%20with%20Realms%20Plus) for more information.  

Minecraft Realms Plus are available in the following editions:  

- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Android 
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for iOS 
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Nintendo Switch 
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PlayStation®4 
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Windows
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Xbox One 
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Chromebook

## How do I renew my expired Realm? 

Whether you are trying to dust off an old Realm or just forgot to extend your time, you may want to renew an expired Realm. Currently it is not possible to add time to an expired Realm. However, the world within the expired Realm is not lost! After you purchase a new subscription and create a new Realm it is possible to move any backups made of the world within the expired Realm to the new Realm.

### How to create a backup of an expired Realm 

Creating a backup of a world is simple and easy. Creating backups is a good habit and can help you make sure you always keep your world safe.

### Quick guide to creating a backup.** **

In Minecraft: Bedrock Edition** **for Windows, Xbox, PlayStation®, Chromebook, Nintendo Switch, or mobile devices:

1.  Select **Edit Realm** in the **Realms**
2.  Select the option to **Download World**. 

**Note: Make sure there is enough room to store it on your device! **

![mceclip0.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4410001356813)

You can export your maps from any version of Realms at any time within an 18-month period after your subscription has expired. After your subscription has been inactive for more than 18 months, your world is permanently deleted from Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers. 

### Replacing a New World with a Backup 

After purchasing a new Realm subscription and creating a new world within that Realm:

From the new Realm game settings (at the bottom of the page):

1.  Select **Replace World**
2.  Choose the backup you’ve created of your previous Realm. 

Your new Realm should now contain your previous world. 

![mceclip1.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4410001399053)

If you encounter an error that prevents you from downloading your world, or if you are having difficulty uploading your world, contact [Minecraft support](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new) for further assistance.

## I Paid my Realm Subscription, but my Realm is Expired?

If you've paid your Realm subscription but your Realm is listed as 'expired,' please contact [Minecraft Support](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## 'Couldn't Create Realm Right Now' Error

If you're encountering a 'Couldn't Create Realm Right Now' error, please try restarting Minecraft seeing if a Realm appears in your Realms section. If that doesn't work, please try the following steps:

1.  Log into the [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account) in which you attempted to make a Realms subscription.
2.  Navigate to the 'Services & Subscriptions' tab on the top.
3.  Ensure a Minecraft Realms subscription is active.
    1.  If a Realms subscription is active and you still cannot create a Realm, please contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).
    2.  If a Realms subscription is not active, please try going through the Realms purchase flow again.

## How does Mojang backup your Realm?

A Realm world is downloadable within 18 months, but the world backups associated with that Realm may have been removed depending on our retention policy. In general, we take a backup every 30 minutes while you are playing, and at the end of a play session. We can’t keep all of your backups around forever though. If a Realm world is used actively, the following retention policy is in effect:  

- In the last 24 hours: We retain all backups.
- 1 day to 8 days ago: We retain one backup per day.
- 9 days to 36 days ago: We retain one backup a week.
- 37 days to 121 days ago: We retain one backup a month.
- 122+ days ago: No backups are retained.*** ***

**Note: If you’d like to save a copy of your world indefinitely, we suggest you download your work to your local storage. Also, we keep the most recent backup within each given window above, meaning that as backups age they may move into the next window, which could result in an older backup being removed.**

## How do I cancel my Realms subscription? 

Follow these steps to cancel recurring billing on your subscription. 

For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, your subscriptions are managed through the stores on the platform where you first activated your subscription. Here’s how to access the platform store to manage your subscription: 

1.  Go to **Settings** from the game's main menu.

3.  Click the **Manage** button on the subscription you want to manage in the Settings menu.

This takes you to the platform store where you can review and cancel your subscription as needed.

### Nintendo Switch 

Starting December 13th, 2021, we will be offering recurring Realms and Realms Plus subscriptions on Nintendo Switch instead of one-time purchases. Here’s what this means for Realms players: 

- This subscription will be an ongoing monthly service. Once you sign up, your Realms will be renewed automatically every month until you cancel. 
- You will be able to use a credit card to pay for this service instead of having to pay in Minecoins. Minecoins can no longer be used to purchase Minecraft Realms. 
- As always, only the Realms owner must pay, friends always join for free  

To set up this process, just follow the steps below. If you already have an active Realms subscription, it can be renewed as a recurring subscription once it runs out.   

1.  Launch the game 
2.  Select Settings 
3.  Go to the Subscriptions tab 
4.  Find your Expired Realm 
5.  Click on “Renew”, and you will be prompted to the “Renew Your Realm” menu 
6.  Agree to the Terms and Conditions, then click "Renew for \$3.99 (2-player Realm) or \$7.99 (Realms Plus) per month". You will be redirected to the "Automatic Renewal Subscription" page of the Nintendo eShop 
7.  Click on the “Proceed to purchase” button. 
8.  Enter your address to register your location to Nintendo. 
9.  Select a payment method (credit card or available Nintendo eShop funds).  
10. Enter your username and password to authenticate your identity. 
11. Review your selections. If everything looks good, click “Add Funds and Purchase”.  
12. Click “Return to Software” to go back to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. You will see a “Creating Realm” dialogue. 
13. You can now join your Realm with a recurring subscription.  

Please note that at Realms subscriptions for Nintendo Switch are not available in South Korea at this time.

If you have any questions regarding this process, please contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). If for any reason you need a refund for a purchase made on the Nintendo eShop, please contact [Nintendo Customer Support](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/).
