This article addresses billing issues for Realms in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. See [Minecraft: Java Edition Realms Billing Issues FAQ](./Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realms-Billing-Issues-FAQ.md) for Minecraft: Java Edition Realms billing issues.

**Note: A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms subscription is separate from a Minecraft: Java Edition Realms subscription. Realms subscriptions do not carry over between game versions. If you would like a Realm in Bedrock Edition and one in Java Edition, you need to set up two separate subscriptions. **

## ARE THERE TRIALS AVAILABLE FOR MINECRAFT REALMS PLUS?

We offer a free 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms to players who have not previously had a Realm and have signed up for a 10-user subscription. See our [Realms homepage](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/bedrock#:~:text=Visit%C2%A0Minecraft%20Marketplace%C2%A0in-game%20to%20purchase%20a%C2%A0Realms%20for%20Bedrock%20Edition%C2%A0or%C2%A0Realms,a%20new%20world.%20Now%20included%20with%20Realms%20Plus) for more information.

Minecraft Realms Plus is available in the following editions: 

- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Android 
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for iOS 
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Nintendo Switch 
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PlayStation 4 
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Windows
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Xbox One 
- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Chromebook

## HOW DO I RENEW MY EXPIRED REALM? 

Whether you are trying to dust off an old Realm or just forgot to extend your time, you may want to renew an expired Realm. Well, it is just as easy as buying a new Realm. In game from the main menu, click on the settings button, and then navigate to the subscription section. Click the **Renew** button on the Realm you would like to reactivate, and then complete the purchase flow to set up a new subscription for that Realm.

## I PAID MY REALM SUBSCRIPTION, BUT MY REALM IS EXPIRED?

If you've paid your Realm subscription but your Realm is still listed as 'expired,' please contact [Minecraft Support](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## 'COULDN'T CREATE REALM RIGHT NOW' ERROR

If you encounter a 'Couldn't Create Realm Right Now' error, please first confirm that you do have an active subscription within the platform store (IE the PlayStation store, or the Xbox Store, etc) that you purchased on. Once you have confirmed your purchase, try restarting Minecraft on that device and check to see if a Realm appears on the play screen. If that doesn't work, please try entering the marketplace, going to the Realm Plus screen, and restarting the purchase flow by clicking **Subscribe Now**. This should cause the game to retry creating your Realm. You will not need to complete the purchase again though, so make sure you do not progress beyond the platform store pop up.

If this does not work, please [contact Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).

## HOW DO I CANCEL MY REALMS SUBSCRIPTION? 

Follow these steps to cancel recurring billing on your subscription. 

For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, your subscriptions are managed through the stores on the platform where you first activated your subscription. Here’s how to access the platform store to manage your subscription: 

1.  Go to** Settings** from the game's main menu.  
2.  Select the **Subscriptions** option in the list on the left.

This takes you to the platform store where you can review and cancel your subscription as needed.
