For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, your subscriptions are managed through the stores on the platform where you first activated your subscription. Here’s how to access the platform store to manage your subscription: 

Your payment method is managed by the store you bought your Realms subscription on. If you need to cancel it, you can reach the store this way:

1.  Open Minecraft on the device you bought your Realm subscription.
2.  On the title screen, click **Settings**.
3.  On the left, scroll down and select **Subscriptions.**
4.  Find the Realm you want to update your payment method for and click **Manage**.
5.  This will open the store management page for that subscription.
