## Why are there two versions of Realm servers?

We've developed two separate versions of Minecraft so that the game runs well on different platforms. Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, the version you find on mobile, console, Chromebook, and Windows 10 (and above) runs on one kind of code, and Minecraft: Java Edition (for PC, Mac and Linux) runs on another.  

These two versions are incompatible with each other and are developed separately with different features. Players on Minecraft: Java Edition can't play on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms and vice versa.   

**Note: A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms subscription is separate from a Minecraft: Java Edition Realms subscription. Realms subscriptions do not carry over between game versions. If you would like a Realm in Bedrock Edition and one in Java Edition, you need to set up two separate subscriptions. **

## Are there trials available for Minecraft Realms?

We offer a free 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms to players who have not previously had a Realm and have signed up for a 10-user subscription. See the [Realms homepage](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms-for-java) for more information.  Afterward, you can sign up for a recurring subscription to keep your Realm active. 

## How do I renew my expired Realm?

Whether you are trying to dust off an old Realm or just forgot to extend your time, you may want to renew an expired Realm. To renew an expired subscription, [login to Minecraft.net and click on **My Realms**](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/myrealms). Next to your Realm there is a **Reactivate** button to renew your Realm subscription.

Follow these steps to cancel recurring billing on your subscription:

For Minecraft: Java Edition, log into Minecraft at the [Log In](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login) page and you will be taken to your Minecraft Profile/Account. Select “Wallet & Realms” from the left navigation bar to access your subscriptions. You can cancel them at any time by selecting the “Pause”, “Manage”, or “Cancel” button** **next to your Realm.
