## Why are there are two versions of Realms servers?

We've developed two separate versions of Minecraft so that the game runs well on different platforms. Minecraft, the version you find on mobile, console and Windows 10 (and above) runs on one kind of code, and Minecraft: Java Edition (for PC, Mac and Linux) runs on another.  

These two versions are incompatible with each other and are developed separately with different features. Players on Minecraft: Java Edition can't play on console, mobile or Windows 10 and above, Realms and vice versa.   

**Note: A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms subscription is separate from a Minecraft: Java Edition Realms subscription.** **Realms subscriptions do not carry over between game versions. If you would like a Realm in Bedrock Edition and one in Java Edition, you need to set up two separate subscriptions. **

## Are there trials available for Minecraft Realms? 

We offer a free 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms to players who have not previously had a Realm and have signed up for a 10-user subscription. See the [Realms homepage](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms-for-java) for more information.  

Afterward, you can sign up for a recurring subscription to keep your Realm active. Currently, one-time payments are not available. To access Realms, you will need to purchase a subscription. Unfortunately, we cannot provide any further information regarding this change.  

## How do I renew my expired Realm? 

Whether you are trying to dust off an old Realm or just forgot to extend your time, you may want to renew an expired Realm. Currently, it is not possible to add time to an expired Realm. However, the world within the expired Realm is not lost! After you purchase a new subscription and create a new Realm it is possible to move any backups made of the world within the expired Realm to the new Realm. 

## How to create a backup of an expired Realm 

Creating a backup of a world is simple and easy. Creating backups is a good habit and can help you make sure you always keep your world safe.

### Quick guide to creating a backup:

In **Minecraft: Java Edition**, manually back up your Realm by simply closing and then reopening the Realm. Whenever you do this, it instantly creates a backup. To download the world into your single-player world list, follow our in-depth guide at [Minecraft: Java Edition: How Do I Download My Realms World?](../Minecraft-Java-Realms/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realms-Creation-FAQ.md#downloading-your-realms-world) 

You can export your maps from any version of Realms at any time within an 18 month period after your subscription has expired. After your subscription has been inactive for more than 18 months, your world is permanently deleted from Minecraft servers. 

## Replacing a New World with a Backup 

After purchasing a new Realm subscription and creating a new world within that Realm, you can access the Realm configuration menu to upload a backup.

1.  From the main menu select **Realms**
2.  Find the Realm you wish to modify and select the **wrench icon**
3.  Under Worlds, select an **empty world slot**
4.  Click **Upload world**
5.  Select the backup you would like to load

If you encounter an error that prevents you from downloading your world, or if you are having difficulty uploading your world, please contact [Minecraft support](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new) for further assistance.

## How does Mojang backup your Realm?

A Realm world is downloadable within 18 months, but the world backups associated with that Realm may have been removed depending on our retention policy. In general, we take a backup every 30 minutes while you are playing, and at the end of a play session. We can’t keep all of your backups around forever though. If a Realm world is used actively, the following retention policy is in effect:  

- In the last 24 hours: We retain all backups.
- 1 day to 8 days ago: We retain one backup per day.
- 9 days to 36 days ago: We retain one backup a week.
- 37 days to 121 days ago: We retain one backup a month.
- 122+ days ago: No backups are retained.*** ***

**Note: If you’d like to save a copy of your world indefinitely, we suggest you download your work to your local storage. Also, we keep the most recent backup within each given window above, meaning that as backups age they may move into the next window, which could result in an older backup being removed.**

## How do I cancel my Minecraft Realms subscription? 

Follow these steps to cancel recurring billing on your subscription:

For **Minecraft: Java Edition**, log into Minecraft at the [Log In](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login) page and you will be taken to your Minecraft Profile/Account. Select '**My Wallet**' from the left navigation bar to access your subscriptions. You can cancel them at any time by selecting the '**Pause'** or the **'Manage'** button next to your recurring payment.
