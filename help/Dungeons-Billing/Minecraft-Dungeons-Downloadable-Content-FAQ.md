This article provides information on Minecraft Dungeons' downloadable content (DLC).

# In This Article:

- [**Echoing Void DLC**](#echoing-void-dlc)
- **[Flames of the Nether DLC](#flames-of-the-nether-dlc)**
- **[Hidden Depths DLC](#hidden-depths-dlc)**
- **[Howling Peaks DLC](#howling-peaks-dlc)**
- **[Jungle Awakens and Creeping Winter DLC](#jungleawakensandcreepingwinterdlc)**
- **[Minecraft Dungeons Season Pass](#minecraft-dungeonsseasonpass)**
- **[Minecraft Dungeons Ultimate Edition](#minecraft-dungeons-ultimate-edition)**

## Does the DLC have to be purchased for each platform? 

Each DLC pack must be purchased separately for each platform. Purchasing content on one platform will not grant access on another platform. If you purchased the game for Windows 10 from the Windows Store, be sure to purchase the DLC from there. 

## How do I install DLC packs?

Please check out [How to Install Downloadable Content and Hero Pass Content](../Dungeons-Technical/Minecraft-Dungeons-Cloud-Saves-and-Backing-Up-Heroes.md#download-heroes) for a step-by-step guide on installing downloadable content for your platform.

## How do I install game updates?

Please check out [How to Update Minecraft Dungeons](../Dungeons-Technical/Minecraft-Dungeons-Download-and-Installation-FAQ.md#manuallyupdate-minecraft-dungeons) that will guide you through how to update Minecraft Dungeons on your platform of choice so you can enjoy the latest new features and bug fixes.

## Does everyone need to own the DLC to play new missions together?

If the host of a game session owns the DLC, players that do not own them can still join the host and play the new missions. All players will still be able to obtain new gear that is dropped, even if they don’t own the DLC. You will need to purchase the DLC if you want to play the new missions in your own game session.

## How do I access DLC content missions? Do I have to complete the main story first?

After installing the DLC, head to the Mission Select map in the Camp and navigate and find The Stronghold mission to start your adventure.

If the content does not appear, ensure that Minecraft Dungeons is updated to the latest version via an internet connection before accessing the new content.

## Where can I find patch notes for the latest update?

Minecraft Dungeons patch notes can be found at [aka.ms/DungeonsUpdate](https://aka.ms/DungeonsUpdate).

## Where can I get help?

For issues related to Minecraft Dungeons, please visit [our Minecraft Dungeons support articles](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/12618243027597). Any inquiries related to Microsoft accounts and the Xbox Live service can be directed to [**Xbox Support**](http://support.xbox.com/).

*As of September 28, 2023, the Minecraft Dungeons Bug Tracker will no longer be accepting new bugs. For more information, check out our [latest announcement](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/dungeons--25-million-players) about Minecraft Dungeons.*

## Echoing Void DLC

### What is included with Echoing Void?

In the Echoing Void DLC, you’ll face bold new enemies, collect legendary gear, and make your way through challenging missions to put a stop to the untold threats that lurk in the dark dimension in which Endermen reside.

![mceclip0.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409165546253)

- Three new missions
- All-new mobs and enemies

The puzzles and winding paths are aplenty in the Gauntlet of Gales. Enter the sanctum and complete the challenges to say that you’ve truly conquered the gauntlet!

## Flames of the Nether DLC

### What is included with Flames of the Nether?

Minecraft Dungeons has arrived in the Nether! This DLC bursts at the seams with new content for those brave enough to take on the greatest challenges yet. The DLC is available for \$5.99 USD and is also included as the second DLC for those that own the Minecraft Dungeons Season Pass.

- Six new Nether missions
- Take down new enemies from the Nether
- New weapons, gear, and artifacts

![mceclip1.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409158962957)

### Ancient Hunts

Ancient Hunts are procedurally-generated end-game missions that weave in and out of the Nether. To access the Ancient Hunts, you’ll need to sacrifice items and Enchantment Points that will change the way your mission unfolds and what sweet loot you’ll receive at the end! If you want that mega-rare and brand-new Gilded gear, you’ll have to take on the Ancient Hunts and defeat the elusive Ancient mobs!

Looking for more details on Ancient Hunts? Check out this [in-depth overview](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/dungeons-dev-blog---adjusting-endgame) over at Minecraft.net.

### Gilded Gear

Gilded gear drops are part of the free update as ultra-rare items with an extra Enchantment slot built-in, making them some of the most powerful items in the game. To get these end-game level items, you’ll have to face the Ancient Hunts and travel to the dangerous Nether.

### Gold Currency and Piglin Merchant

Would it even be a trip to the Nether without a visit from Minecraft’s favorite pig-headed mobs? Everyone knows these battle-loving mobs are focused on the fight, but there’s one thing they love most of all: gold. Once you get your first piece of gold, the Piglin merchant will set up shop in the mysterious cave that’s popped up near camp. Trade your gold for items, possibly even rare Gilded gear!

## Hidden Depths DLC

### What is included with Hidden Depths?

**![mceclip2.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409165591949)**

Dive into your next adventure with the new Minecraft Dungeons: Hidden Depths DLC! Gear up and make a splash with new missions, sunken treasures, and enemies. The DLC is available for \$5.99 USD and is also included as the third DLC for those that own the Minecraft Dungeons Season Pass.

- Three new underwater missions
- A mix of salty new mobs and enemies
- New weapons, gear, and artifacts
- Two new skins and a baby turtle pet

Want to see some gameplay? Watch the latest [Minecraft Developer Diary](https://youtu.be/jaqXfoxGvWY) where the team walks you through some of the exciting things you’ll find in Hidden Depths, including the free content coming with this update.

### What free content is coming alongside Hidden Depths?

Along with the release of the paid DLC, there is also a free update available with new enchantments and Raid Captains.

![mceclip3.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409165756813)

Taking down these dangerous foes will immediately change the way you play the game. Beat them down and they’ll drop one of two tokens: one which instantly increases the mission’s threat level and another which adds a rules modifier to your current mission. Survive the mission with tokens in tow and you’ll earn the Raid Captain’s Bounty, a special reward at the end of the mission. Seek out these Raid Captains and add a new level of challenge to your missions (and more importantly, reap the rewards)!

## Howling Peaks DLC

### What is included with Howling Peaks?

The Howling Peaks DLC is an action-packed trek to the mountain top that features dazzling new armor, weapons, and artifacts. Of course, new enemies such as the Squall Golem and Mountaineer await you along the way as well – no one said it would be easy! Atop it all is the source of the stormy conflict, the Tempest Golem who has been corrupted by a shard from the Orb of Dominance.

Of course, even if you don’t purchase the Howling Peaks DLC or the Season Pass, there is always new, free content for you to enjoy. With this update you will get six free enchantments, all of which have the potential to totally change the way you play the game!

Want to see some gameplay? Watch the fantastic [Minecraft Developer Diary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9u6feiMtrs) where the team walks you through Howling Peaks.

## Jungle Awakens and Creeping Winter DLC

### What downloadable content (DLC) is available now for Minecraft Dungeons? 

The Jungle Awakens and Creeping Winter packs are available for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation® 4, Windows PC and Xbox One. 

### What can I do in Creeping Winter? 

- A creeping winter is slowly taking over everything it touches, and the source of its chilling power is a powerful creature known as the Wretched Wraith. 
- Take on three new missions and face new enemies such as the Illusioner and Iceologer. 
- As you hunt down the source of corruption, you’ll discover new armor, weapons, and artifacts below the snow and sleet.
- Try two new player skins and the Arctic Fox pet. 
- Conquer [Daily Trials](../Dungeons-Technical/Minecraft-Dungeons-Daily-Trials-FAQ.md)(free to all players). New daily challenges make wild changes to the game mechanics, providing difficult, experimental, or fun challenges for you to overcome so you can earn powerful rewards.

- Trek through three new missions that will take you to the heart of the jungle where you’ll find new weapons, armor, and artifacts.

- Discover a new secret mission, Lower Temple, for free! 

### Are Jungle Awakens and Creeping Winter sold separately?  

Those who own Minecraft Dungeons Hero Edition, or the Hero Pass Upgrade do not need to purchase Jungle Awakens or Creeping Winter. However, each DLC pack can be purchased separately if you do not have Hero Edition or the Hero Pass.

### Are Jungle Awakens and Creeping Winter included in the physical retail version of Minecraft Dungeons?

Yes, both Jungle Awakens and Creeping Winter are included in the physical retail version of Minecraft Dungeons Hero Edition. An online update is required to access the content so please see our [Minecraft Dungeons FAQ](../Dungeons-Accounts/Minecraft-Dungeons-FAQ.md) for more information.

## Minecraft Dungeons Season Pass

### What is the Minecraft Dungeons Season Pass? 

The Minecraft Dungeons Season Pass was a bundle that included four downloadable content (DLC) packs, as they become available. You could purchase the Season Pass for \$19.99 USD and get the DLCs at a discount compared to purchasing each one separately. Please note that as of 2022, the Season Pass has been delisted from digital stores.

### How does the Season Pass differ from the Hero Pass? 

The Season Pass does not include content from the Hero Pass. These two passes are no longer available for purchase but are included in the Ultimate Edition/Ultimate DLC Bundle.

While Hero Pass contains the first two DLC packs, Jungle Awakens and Creeping Winter, the Season Pass contains the next four DLC packs, starting with Howling Peaks. Here are the contents of each pass:

|                                |                                     |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Hero Pass**                  | **Season Pass**                     |
| <u>DLC 1: Jungle Awakens</u>   | <u>DLC 3: Howling Peaks</u>         |
| <u>DLC 2: Creeping Winter</u>  | <u>DLC 4: Flames of the Nether</u>  |
| Hero Pass Cosmetics            | <u>DLC 5 Hidden Depths</u>          |
|                                | DLC 6 Echoing Void                  |

### What will the next DLC packs be? 

We’re not ready to reveal the upcoming DLC but you can get a pretty good idea by catching up on the [Minecraft Dungeons announcements and news from Minecraft Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OifNJFdB5FM). 

### Does the DLC or Season Pass have to be purchased for each platform? 

You must purchase each DLC pack separately for each platform. Purchasing content on one platform will not grant access on another platform. 

**Note: If you purchased Minecraft for Windows from the Windows Store, be sure to purchase DLC from there. If you play the game via the [Minecraft Launcher](../Dungeons-Technical/Minecraft-Dungeons-Download-and-Installation-FAQ.md#minecraftunifiedlauncher), be sure to purchase any DLC through [minecraftdungeons.net](https://minecraftdungeons.net/). **

## Minecraft Dungeons Ultimate Edition

Minecraft Dungeons Ultimate Edition is here and contains all the previously released DLC content in one package! This means you will receive all six previously released DLC packs, plus the Hero Pass Cosmetics.  

**The Hero Edition, Hero Pass and Season Pass have been delisted from digital stores**, but current owners won’t lose access to their content! We know you might have some questions, so continue below to our FAQs.
