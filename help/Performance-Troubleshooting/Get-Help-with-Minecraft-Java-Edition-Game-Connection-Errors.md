This article applies to Minecraft: Java Edition. If you need help with Minecraft for Windows, Xbox One, or mobile, see this [Minecraft support resources page](./Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Support-Resources.md).

If you are receiving a message in your launcher that states **Oh no! Something went wrong, and we couldn't connect to Minecraft Services**, use the steps to help resolve the problem or verify a system outage.

## I CANNOT CONNECT TO GAME SERVICES

If you are having issues connecting to one of our services relating to Minecraft: Java Edition, first check the [Mojang Status on X](https://twitter.com/MojangStatus) after logging in. Mojang Studio servers automatically notify our web developers whenever there is a major outage, so if an outage continues, it's likely that the issue is being worked on. Please be patient and try again later.

If you receive an error, but an outage has not been reported, check your Internet, antivirus, and/or firewall connections. You may need to refresh your profile's authentication and connection with our servers by logging out of the game and logging back in.

Be sure to also check your firewall or security software is not blocking the following services:

- minecraftservices.com
- mojang.com
- minecraft.net
- s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftSkins

If the issue persists, try again later, or consult your system's Help resources on network settings.

## INTERNAL EXCEPTION ERROR

If you're receiving the io.netty.handler.codec.decodeexception error when connecting to a server, the server is likely having a plug-in issue. Contact the server owner and see if they have any plug-ins that need updating.
