Achievements are optional goals and milestones that can be completed while playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in Survival mode. Each achievement tells you how to complete it in its in-game description. Visit [Your Profile](../Manage-Your-Minecraft-Profile/View-and-Edit-Your-Minecraft-Profile.md) to see a list of completed achievements and suggested next achievements. 

## Requirements to unlock achievements

- **A connected Microsoft account**: Achievements are tied to your Xbox profile, so you will need to sign in to Minecraft with a Microsoft account to earn them. See [Use or Link Microsoft Accounts](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/sections/29296773863181) for information. PlayStation players earn PlayStation Network trophies instead of achievements; these do not display on your Minecraft profile.
- **A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Survival mode world**: Achievements can only be unlocked in Survival mode. Achievements will be disabled if your Realm or world is, or was, set to Creative mode, is flat, or you enabled cheats, experiments, certain Marketplace add-ons, or world templates.
- **An active internet connection**: You cannot earn achievements while playing offline.

See [Fix Achievements Not Displaying or Unlocking in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./Achievements-Not-Displaying-or-Unlocking-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) if your achievements do not show in Your Profile.
