We know you want to get back into your Minecraft world as quickly as possible. If you are dealing with a particular issue, here is a breakdown on what support team can get you back into your game the fastest.

## Account Support

If you are experiencing issues trying to log in to Minecraft with your Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo account, you should contact [Xbox](https://support.xbox.com/en-US), [PlayStation](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/), or [Nintendo](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/) Support directly.

As of December 18, 2023, the migration of Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts officially ended. If you successfully completed the post-migration process, you should now have access to both Java and Bedrock for PC editions. Please visit these pages for help with your Microsoft account:

- New Accounts: [How to create a new Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/how-to-create-a-new-microsoft-account-a84675c3-3e9e-17cf-2911-3d56b15c0aaf)
- Existing Accounts: [Get help with your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/get-help-with-your-microsoft-account-ace6f3b3-e2d3-aeb1-6b96-d2e9e7e52133)

## Technical Support

For any questions regarding Minecraft servers being down, crossplay not working, or various bugs, please contact Minecraft Support. You can also check [the Mojang Status X account](https://twitter.com/MojangStatus) or view the [Mojang Bug Tracker Guidelines and FAQ](./Mojang-Bug-Tracker-Guidelines-and-FAQ.md).

## Minecraft Realms subscription and Marketplace concerns

If you are having [trouble getting a friend to join your Minecraft Realms world](../Create-or-Join-Realms/How-Do-I-Join-Someone-s-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md) or cannot access the Marketplace packs included in your Realms Plus subscription, Minecraft Support will help you out.

Having problems accessing other [Marketplace content](../Minecraft-Marketplace/How-to-Get-Help-With-Missing-Minecoins-in-Minecraft-Marketplace.md) you have purchased? Minecraft Support should be your go-to.

For subscription changes, [refund requests](../General-Billing/Mojang-Studios-Refund-Policy.md), or if you have unrecognized charges, contact [Xbox](https://support.xbox.com/en-US), [PlayStation](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/), or [Nintendo](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/) Support directly.
