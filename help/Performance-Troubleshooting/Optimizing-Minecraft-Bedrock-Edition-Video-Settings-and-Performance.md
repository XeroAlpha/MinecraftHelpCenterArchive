If you’re experiencing crashes or reduced performance playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, you can modify your video settings to improve gameplay. For tips adjusting video settings for Minecraft: Java Edition, see [Optimizing Minecraft: Java Edition Video Settings and Performance](./Optimizing-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md). 

## Adjust advanced video settings in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

Launch Minecraft and select **Settings** \> **Video** to access settings. Try experimenting with these recommendations and restart Minecraft after making adjustments:

- **Reduce FOV:** Select a value below the default field of view of 60-degrees. 
- **Disable advanced features:** Turn off the features below if enabled.
  - Fancy Bubbles
  - Beautiful Skies
  - Smooth Lighting
  - Fancy Graphics
  - FOV Can Be Altered By Gameplay

If you see an improvement in gameplay, gradually reenable these settings until you see an improved render distance without performance issues. Additional device and setup suggestions can also be found in [Fixing Crashes and Lag Issues in Minecraft](./Fixing-Crashes-and-Lag-Issues-in-Minecraft.md).
