If you’re crashing or lagging while playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, changing your video settings may improve gameplay.

*For Minecraft: Java Edition, see [Optimizing Minecraft: Java Edition Video Settings and Performance](./Optimizing-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md). *

## Access video settings in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Settings** from the launch screen.
3.  Select the **Video** tab.

## Video Settings for Improving Minecraft Gameplay

- **Reduce FOV**: Select a value below the default 60-degrees. 
- **Disable advanced features:** Turn off the features below if enabled.
  - Fancy Leaves
  - Fancy Bubbles
  - Render Clouds
  - FOV Can Be Altered By Gameplay
- **Change the Graphics Mode Settings**:
  - **Simple Graphics Mode:** Select this mode to use the lowest amount of system resources. You can also turn off **Beautiful Skies** and **Smooth Lighting** under the Simple Graphics Options.
  - **Fancy Graphics Mode**: Select this mode to use a moderate amount of system resources. You can also turn off **Beautiful Skies** and **Smooth Lighting** under the Fancy Graphics Options.
  - **Vibrant Visuals:** This mode uses the highest amount of system resources. Lower the slider levels or turn off specific effects to find a mix that works for your system.

If your game runs smoother, gradually reenable these settings until you see improved graphics without issues. For other device and setup suggestions, see [Fixing Crashes and Lag Issues in Minecraft](./Fix-Crashes-and-Lag-Issues-in-Minecraft.md).
