Internet connection errors are frustrating to deal with in any game. In Minecraft, you need a connection so you can play with friends, access Realms, and use the Marketplace. Here are various troubleshooting tips to consider when your network connection fails in Minecraft.

## Game Device Troubleshooting

- **Restart your system:** Before trying more advanced troubleshooting steps, it is always a good idea to reset all your hardware and software:
  1.  **Sign out and close programs:** [Sign out of Minecraft](../Account-Sign-In/Sign-Out-of-Minecraft.md), the Microsoft store, the Xbox app and any other Minecraft services that might be running and close the programs.
  2.  **Shut down your game system:** Completely shut down your computer, mobile device, or game console.
  3.  **Restart your Internet connection:** Turn off your router and modem, wait 20 seconds for power to cycle off, and restart your device.
  4.  **Restart your game:** Restart your gaming device, connect to the internet, restart Minecraft and sign in with your Microsoft account.
- **Close other programs and devices:** If there are any other devices or programs accessing your Wi-Fi network, close unnecessary programs and disconnect other devices from your network.
- **Check your subscriptions:** If you are playing Minecraft multiplayer on a console, you must be subscribed to either [Xbox Game Pass Core](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass), [Nintendo Switch Online](https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/), or [PlayStation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/) to play games online.

## Internet and Network Troubleshooting

- **Check internet connections:** Problems connecting to servers or online games are often caused by intermittent or unstable internet connections. Refresh your router and internet connection and verify that you and the host you’re trying to connect to can visit other locations on the internet without issue.
- **Check DNS settings:** If you manually adjusted any of the DNS settings for your device, you may want to set them back to “automatic.”
- **Check NAT settings:** Configure your router to use moderate or open Network Address Translation (NAT)
- **Check open ports:** If you have a firewall, antivirus software, or are using a VPN, check the settings to be sure that it is not blocking or slowing your connection. Ports that need to be open are 80 without destructive proxies, 443 without destructive proxies, 3748, 19132, 19133.
