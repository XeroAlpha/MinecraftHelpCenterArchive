Internet connection errors are frustrating to deal with in any game. In Minecraft, you need a connection so you can play with friends, access Realms, and use the Marketplace. Here are various troubleshooting tips to consider when your network connection fails in Minecraft.

- If you’re playing on a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation™, or Xbox, ensure you have that console’s online subscription service active. This means you need an active subscription to Nintendo Switch Online, PlayStation® Plus, or an Xbox Game Pass Core or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.
- Restart Minecraft.
- Restart your computer or device and see if this fixes the issue. Restarting can often clear errors in connections.
- Try connecting using an Ethernet cable instead of using Wi-Fi.
- If you are using a wireless connection, ensure that you have a stable connection to your router. You may need to reset or restart your router.
- Check your currently running programs for anything that is using your Internet bandwidth and close those programs.
- If you have a firewall, antivirus software, or are using a VPN, check the settings to be sure that it is not blocking or slowing your connection. Ports that need to be open are 26000-28000 and port 80 and 443 without destructive proxies.
- Configure your router to use moderate or open Network Address Translation (NAT).
- If you're playing on a console and you've manually adjusted your DNS settings, try switching your DNS back to automatic and try again.
