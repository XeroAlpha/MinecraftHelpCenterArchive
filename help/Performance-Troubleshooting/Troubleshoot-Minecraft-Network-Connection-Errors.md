If you’re having problems playing with friends, accessing Realms, or using the Minecraft Marketplace, there may be a problem with your internet connection. Try these network troubleshooting suggestions to see if they fix the issue.

## Internet and Network Troubleshooting

- **Use a home/personal network**: If you’re attempting to connect on a work or school internet connection, there may be network restrictions preventing you from playing.
- **Check your internet connection:** Verify that you (and the player you’re trying to play with) can visit other websites without issues.
- **Pause other network traffic**: Stop software downloads, video streams, or network-heavy tasks on your gaming device and other devices. If you share your network, you may want to ask others to do the same while you’re troubleshooting.
- **Check your internet speed**: Run an internet provider recommended speed test to check your internet connection speed and latency.
- **Verify wireless connection strength**: If you’re playing on a wireless network, try moving your gaming device closer to your router.
- **Check DNS settings:**
  - If you manually adjusted any of the DNS settings for your device, you may want to set them back to “automatic.”
  - If you’re on PC, you can also try to flush your DNS cache. See [Fix Ethernet connection problems in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-ethernet-connection-problems-in-windows-2311254e-cab8-42d6-90f3-cb0b9f63645f) and expand the **Run network commands** section for instructions.
- **Check NAT settings:** If you’ve changed your NAT settings for port forwarding or you’re using a VPN, you may need to configure your router to use moderate or open Network Address Translation (NAT).
- **Check open ports:** If you have a firewall, antivirus software, or are using a VPN, check the settings to be sure that it is not blocking or slowing your connection. Ports that need to be open are 80 without destructive proxies, 443 without destructive proxies, 3748, 19132, 19133.
