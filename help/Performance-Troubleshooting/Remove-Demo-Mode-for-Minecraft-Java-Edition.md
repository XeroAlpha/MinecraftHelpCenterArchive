If you purchased Minecraft: Java Edition and are stuck in the demo mode, try these steps to play the full version.

- **Verify you bought Minecraft: Java Edition on the correct account**: Check your Minecraft [All Games](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile) page to verify Minecraft: Java Edition doesn’t have a “Buy Now” button after you sign in. If it does, you may have purchased Minecraft under a different email address.
- **Verify you’re logged in to the correct account**: To locate your logged-in account, select your gamertag in the top-left of the Minecraft Launcher and select **Manage Profile**. Confirm that the gamertag on the profile matches the one in the Launcher. If they don’t match, try [Switching Between Microsoft Accounts in Launcher to Play Minecraft](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/Switching-Between-Microsoft-Accounts-in-Launcher-to-Play-Minecraft.md).
- **Check for refunds**: If your purchase was refunded or didn’t complete, purchase [Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC Deluxe Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc?tabs=%7B%22details%22%3A0%7D) from the store.
- **Complete your Java profile**: You profile must be complete before your purchase is recognized. Go to your [Java profile on Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/mygames/editprofile), choose a profile name, and restart your launcher.[](#_msocom_1) [](#_msocom_2) If your profile is complete, try [Troubleshooting Can’t Connect to Minecraft Services Error After Sign in on Minecraft Launcher](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/Troubleshooting-Can-t-Connect-to-Minecraft-Services-Error-After-Sign-in-on-Minecraft-Launcher.md).
- **Troubleshoot your Launcher or launch directly**: If the launcher doesn't recognize your game license, try [Troubleshooting Minecraft Launcher Issues](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/Troubleshooting-Minecraft-Launcher-Issues.md) and [Troubleshooting Minecraft Sign-in Issues](../Account-Sign-in/Troubleshooting-Minecraft-Sign-in-Issues.md). Alternatively, start Minecraft: Java Edition by searching for it and launching the app directly.
