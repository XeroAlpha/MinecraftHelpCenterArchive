When textures from resource packs do not load properly, Java Edition replaces them with pink and black checkered boxes. To restore missing textures, you may need to remove and then re-apply those resource packs. If available, we recommend re-downloading the packs from their source and replacing them in your pack folder. Follow these steps to access your pack folder and replace the texture files:

1.  Launch Minecraft: Java Edition.
2.  Select **Options**.
3.  Select **Resource Packs**.
4.  Select **Open Pack Folder** to access the location on your device where your resource packs are located.
5.  Back up your files. Before deleting files from this folder, we recommend you first **make backup copies** of the contents in case you need to retrieve them later.
6.  Delete the resource pack folders for the textures that aren't working.
7.  Copy the new resource pack files to your resource pack folder.
8.  Reopen Java Edition.
9.  Select **Options**.
10. Select **Resource Packs**.
11. Select the pack under **Available** to move it to the **Selected** column.  
12. Select **Done**.
