If you are getting Error 0X803F8001 when trying to play Minecraft through the Launcher on your Windows PC, you will see a message that says the following:

**Minecraft Launcher license is currently not available for your account (0X803F8001)**

When getting this error message, here are three suggestions to help you fix it:

## Check your signed in accounts

Minecraft uses several Microsoft services in the background to enable family safety settings and multiplayer games. You need to sign into the same Microsoft account on the Minecraft Launcher, the Microsoft Store app, and the Xbox app. Here is where to check each:

- Minecraft Launcher
  1.  Open the Minecraft Launcher.
  2.  Check the account in the top-left corner.
  3.  To change, click the drop-down menu.
  4.  Select **View all accounts**.
  5.  Select the correct account or select **Switch account**.
  6.  Sign into the account you want to use to play Minecraft.
- Microsoft Store
  1.  Open the [Microsoft Store app](http://aka.ms/MSStoreHome).
  2.  Check the account icon in the top-right corner.
  3.  To change, click the icon.
  4.  Select **Sign out**.
  5.  Sign into the proper account.
- Xbox app
  1.  Open the Xbox app from the Start menu on Windows.
  2.  Check the account in the top-left corner.
  3.  To change, click the account.
  4.  Select Sign out.
  5.  Sign into the proper account.

## Install the Launcher from the Microsoft Store.

If the above doesn’t apply to you, try installing the Minecraft Launcher [directly from the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/NewMCLauncher) and sign in with the Microsoft account you use to play Minecraft.

## Reset the Microsoft Store

If you still receive this error, reset the store.

1.  Press the **Windows key** +** R** simultaneously.
2.  Type in **WSReset** and hit enter.
