If try to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition but can only access the Trial version, you may need to refresh your account sign-in, update your Game Pass Subscription, or repair the Minecraft Launcher.

- **Verify your account**: Make sure you signed in to the Minecraft Launcher with the Microsoft account you used to buy Minecraft. You may be signed in with a different account. If you need to recover your Microsoft account, see [Troubleshooting Locked, Compromised or Stolen Microsoft Accounts](../Account-Sign-in/Troubleshooting-Locked-Compromised-or-Stolen-Microsoft-Accounts.md).
- **Update Your Xbox Game Pass Subscription**: If you are on Xbox or PC and play Minecraft through Xbox Game Pass, check your subscription status. You need an active subscription to play Minecraft. You can renew at [Join Xbox Game Pass: Discover Your Next Favorite Game](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass).
- **Repair the Minecraft Launcher (Windows PC)**: Follow the steps from Microsoft Support to [Repair apps and programs in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/repair-apps-and-programs-in-windows-e90eefe4-d0a2-7c1b-dd59-949a9030f317) for the **Minecraft Launcher**. After that’s done, restart the launcher and check again.

Thought you owned Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, but you don’t? Purchase the [Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC Deluxe Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc?tabs=%7B%22details%22%3A0%7D) and get access to both Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
