If you’re experiencing crashes or reduced performance playing Minecraft: Java Edition, you can modify your video settings to improve gameplay. For tips adjusting video settings for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, see [Optimizing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Video Settings and Performance](./Optimizing-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md). 

## Adjust advanced video settings in Minecraft: Java Edition

Launch Minecraft and select **Options** \> **Video Settings** to access settings. Try experimenting with these recommendations and restart Minecraft after making adjustments:

- **Adjust Graphics setting**: Select **Graphics: Fast** if set to Fancy or Fabulous.
- **Change Render Distance**: Choose a setting below the default of 12 chuncks.
- **Disable Smooth Lighting**: Select **Smooth Lighting: Off** if enabled.
- **Adjust Chunk Builder**: Select **Chunk Builder: Threaded** instead of Fully Blocking or Semi Blocking.
- **Adjust Clouds**: Select **Clouds: Fast** if set to Fancy.

If you see an improvement in gameplay, gradually increase these settings until you see an improved render distance without performance issues. Additional device and setup suggestions can also be found in [Fixing Crashes and Lag Issues in Minecraft](./Fixing-Crashes-and-Lag-Issues-in-Minecraft.md).
