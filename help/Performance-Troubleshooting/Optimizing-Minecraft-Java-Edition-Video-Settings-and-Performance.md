If you have crashes or reduced performance playing Minecraft: Java Edition, you can change your video settings to improve gameplay. For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition tips, see [Optimizing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Video Settings and Performance](./Optimizing-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md). 

## Adjust advanced video settings in Minecraft: Java Edition

Launch Minecraft: Java Edition and select **Options** \> **Video Settings** to access settings. Try experimenting with these recommendations and restart Minecraft after making adjustments:

- **Adjust Graphics setting**: Select **Graphics: Fast** if set to Fancy or Fabulous.
- **Change Render Distance**: Choose a setting below the default of 12 chunks.
- **Disable Smooth Lighting**: Select **Smooth Lighting: Off** if enabled.
- **Adjust Chunk Builder**: Select **Chunk Builder: Threaded** instead of Fully Blocking or Semi Blocking.
- **Adjust Clouds**: Select **Clouds: Fast** if set to Fancy.

If you see an improvement in gameplay, gradually increase these settings until you see an improved render distance without performance issues.
