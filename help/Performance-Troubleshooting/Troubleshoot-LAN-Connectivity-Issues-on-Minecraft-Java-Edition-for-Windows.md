If you use a Windows PC and are hosting your single-player world on your home Internet via Local Area Network (LAN), but a Timeout error occurs when your friend tries to connect to it, you may need to change your Windows **Network profile** settings from Public to Private. This will allow other Minecraft players to connect to your world via Home network LAN.

## Change your Windows Network profile to Private

1.  Close Minecraft. 
2.  Right-click your Internet connection icon (the wireless connection or network icon in the System Tray) and select **Network & Internet settings**. 
3.  Select **Properties** for your Home Network connection. 
4.  Under **Network Profile Type**, change the type from **Public** to **Private**. 
5.  Start Minecraft, load your world, and click **Open to LAN**.
6.  Your friends should now be able to join your world from the Play Multiplayer screen!

**Note**: The **Public** profile is used for networks that you cannot trust, such as free Wi-Fi at a café. It is not recommended to change this setting if you are connected to a public network that you cannot trust.
