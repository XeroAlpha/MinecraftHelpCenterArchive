If you’re running a legacy version of Minecraft: Java Edition, you may be exposed to security vulnerability within Log4j, a common Java logging library, that affects Minecraft: Java Editions 1.7 to 1.17.

The latest versions do not contain this exploit, so we recommend you [Download Minecraft & Server Software](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download) and update to the latest version of Minecraft for security.

## Hosting a legacy version of Minecraft safely

If you’re hosting a legacy Minecraft: Java Edition server and decide not to update, follow these steps to secure your version.

- **1.18**: Upgrade to 1.18.1. Otherwise, use the same approach as for 1.17.x below.
- **1.17**: Add these JVM arguments to your startup command line: `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`
- **1.12-1.16.5**: Download [this XML file](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/02937d122c86ce73319ef9975b58896fc1b491d1/log4j2_112-116.xml) to the working directory where your server runs. Then add these JVM arguments to your startup command line: `-Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2_112-116.xml`
- **1.7-1.11.2**: Download [this XML file](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/4bb89a97a66f350bc9f73b3ca8509632682aea2e/log4j2_17-111.xml) to the working directory where your server runs. Then add these JVM arguments to your startup command line: `-Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2_17-111.xml`
