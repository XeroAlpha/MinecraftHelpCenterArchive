Mojang is improving the Minecraft: Java Edition ecosystem regarding third-party applications that interact with the Java Edition game service APIs. While many of these third-party applications integrate successfully into our services, some attempt to maliciously exploit our users through methods such as phishing attempts.   

We’re enforcing new policies on third-party apps that seek to access Java game service APIs. From now on, we will be reviewing and manually adding all future API integration requests to an allow list. Existing applications, such as launchers and websites, will continue to have access without interruption. However, new applications must request access via [this form](https://aka.ms/mce-reviewappid).

We’re implementing these measures to provide a more secure experience for players and developers, and we greatly appreciate your understanding. We also understand the importance of community involvement when it comes to identifying suspicious applications. If you find a suspicious application, please report it using the form linked above. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please contact us [here](mailto:enforce@minecraft.net).
