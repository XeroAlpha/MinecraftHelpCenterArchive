An error can occur when joining a world if you are using Character Creator items, skins, or Add‑Ons that are incompatible with the world you are trying to join. Use the suggestions below to change skins or settings and try to join your world again.

- **Adjust Trusted Skins Settings:** Using a skin from an unverified source that may be incompatible with the world you are trying to join can cause world connection errors. Open Settings/General and toggle Only Allow Trusted Skins off.
- **Remove Character Creator Items:** Select Edit Character in the Dressing Room and remove any custom items such as Hair, Eyes, Outerwear, or Back Items.
- **Switch to a Default Skin:** Reverting to a classic skin helps confirm whether your current skin is causing the issue. Choose a Classic Skin from the Dressing Room. See [Equip Minecraft Character Creator Items and Skins in the Dressing Room](../Managing-Marketplace-Content/Equip-Minecraft-Character-Creator-Items-and-Skins-in-the-Dressing-Room.md).
- **Check for incompatible Add-Ons:** Visit [Disable Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Add-Ons to Solve Game Issues](../Marketplace-Troubleshooting/Disable-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Add-Ons-to-Solve-Game-Issues.md) to learn how to troubleshoot Add-On issues.
