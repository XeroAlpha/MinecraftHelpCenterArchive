Players with Minecraft: Java Edition on Windows may see this OpenGL-related error when they launch the game:

**GLFW error 65542: WGL: The driver does not appear to support OpenGL**

This error appears when your device's graphics driver does not support OpenGL, which Java Edition requires to run. You can fix this error with a compatibility pack.

## Install and Enable the OpenGL Compatibility Pack

1.  Download and install the [OpenCL and OpenGL Compatibility Pack ](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NQPSL29BFFF)from the Microsoft Store onto your device.
2.  Restart your computer and try launching Minecraft again.
