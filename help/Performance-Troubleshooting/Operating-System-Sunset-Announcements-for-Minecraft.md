## Limitations of Minecraft on Sunset Devices

After an operating system is sunset, your device will no longer receive the latest Minecraft updates, and we cannot provide troubleshooting for unsupported devices. Here is more information about playing on a sunset system:

- **Access to worlds and Marketplace content**: After you receive a final Minecraft update for your sunset operating system, you will still be able to play on your worlds and access Marketplace purchases (including Minecoins).
- **Access to Realms**: Realms managed with a device running a sunset operating system will continue to work for 6 months unless they are updated by the Realm owner on a different device. If you need to cancel a Realm for an incompatible device, see [Cancel Realms Subscriptions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/36000025812877) for information.
- **Access to multiplayer games**: Sunset devices cannot join multilayer games with other players using the most recent versions of Minecraft and may be incompatible with some multiplayer servers.
