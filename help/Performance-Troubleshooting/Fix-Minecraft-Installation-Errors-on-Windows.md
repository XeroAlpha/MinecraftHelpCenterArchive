You can download and install Minecraft on Windows through the Microsoft Store or the Minecraft Launcher. If Minecraft stops or stalls while installing through either of them, a simple reset may fix the problem.

## How to reset the Microsoft Store on Windows

1.  Follow the steps from Microsoft Support for [Microsoft Store doesn't open](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/microsoft-store-doesn-t-open-126a875d-8b72-def1-0af6-d325276a058b).
2.  Go to the [Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NXP44L49SHJ?hl=en&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare) listing in the Microsoft Store and download the Minecraft Launcher.

## How to reset the Minecraft Launcher

Follow the steps from Microsoft Support to [Repair apps and programs in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/repair-apps-and-programs-in-windows-e90eefe4-d0a2-7c1b-dd59-949a9030f317) and try again.

If these steps don’t work, uninstall and reinstall the Minecraft Launcher.
