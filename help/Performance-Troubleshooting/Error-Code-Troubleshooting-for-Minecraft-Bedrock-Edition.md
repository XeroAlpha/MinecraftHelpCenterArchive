For Marketplace errors, see [Troubleshooting Minecraft Marketplace Error Codes](../Marketplace-Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting-Minecraft-Marketplace-Error-Codes.md).

 

Many of the error codes you may encounter when playing Minecraft occur when your gaming system loses contact with servers and the Microsoft and Xbox services that enable multiplayer games, crossplay, and access to Marketplace content across devices.

You can find troubleshooting suggestions for specific error codes below. If your specific error isn’t addressed, following some of the general device troubleshooting steps may help.

**Before starting troubleshooting, back up any Minecraft files you wish to keep.** If you need assistance, see [Backing up Minecraft Worlds](../Backup-Restore/How-to-Transfer-Your-World-to-Another-Device-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md).

## General Error Code Troubleshooting

- **Update your game version:** Check the settings on your game platform to make sure you’re receiving automatic updates and running the latest release. See our [Download & Install](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166490706957) help section for information about manually updating Minecraft. If you do apply an update, make sure to restart your device and game.
- **Sign out and restart:** [Sign out of Minecraft](../Account-Sign-In/How-to-Sign-Out-of-Minecraft.md), the Microsoft store, the Xbox app and any other Minecraft services that might be running and close the programs. Then shut down and restart your game system before restarting Minecraft and signing in again.
- **Check your internet connection:** See [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](./Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md) for suggestions.
- **Adjust your video settings:** Low bandwidth, limited memory, or not enough processing power can impact game performance. See [Optimizing Video Settings and Performance in Minecraft](./Optimizing-Video-Settings-and-Performance-in-Minecraft.md) for tips.
- **Disable add-ons:** If you are running a lot of modifications in your world, these third-party applications may not play nice with each other and other systems. You can try turning enhancements on and off. See Disabling Minecraft Add-Ons \| Minecraft Help for information.
- **Wait and try again:** Sometimes servers go down and things need to hit with a pickaxe. You may need to wait and give time for issues to get fixed on the server side before trying again.

## Named Error Code Troubleshooting
