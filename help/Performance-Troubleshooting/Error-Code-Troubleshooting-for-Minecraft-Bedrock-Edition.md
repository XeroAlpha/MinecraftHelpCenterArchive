- Restart the game, then sign back into your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Microsoft account(s)
- If you still see the error: repeat the steps above after waiting 1 hour, including internet troubleshooting steps.

Additional steps if you're playing on a Windows, Android, Xbox, or iOS device:

- Make sure you're logging in with the right Microsoft account.
- Install the "Xbox App", which you can find by searching for "Xbox" in your platform's store app or in the Microsoft Store.
