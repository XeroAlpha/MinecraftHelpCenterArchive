For Marketplace errors, see [Troubleshooting Minecraft Marketplace Error Codes](../Marketplace-Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting-Minecraft-Marketplace-Error-Codes.md).

Many of the error codes you may encounter when playing Minecraft occur when your gaming system loses contact with servers and the Microsoft and Xbox services that enable multiplayer games, crossplay, and access to Marketplace content across devices.

You can find troubleshooting suggestions for specific error codes below. If your specific error isn’t addressed, following some of the General Error Code Troubleshooting steps may help.

**Before starting troubleshooting, back up any Minecraft files you wish to keep.** See [Backing up Minecraft Worlds](../Backup-Restore/How-to-Transfer-Your-World-to-Another-Device-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) for instructions.

## General Error Code Troubleshooting

- **Update your game version:** Check the settings on your game platform to make sure you’re receiving automatic updates and running the latest release. See our [Download & Install](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166490706957) help section for information about manually updating Minecraft. If you do apply an update, make sure to restart your device and game.
- **Sign out and restart:** [Sign out of Minecraft](../Account-Sign-In/Sign-Out-of-Minecraft.md), the Microsoft store, the Xbox app and any other Minecraft services that might be running and close the programs. Then shut down and restart your game system before restarting Minecraft and signing in again.
- **Check your internet connection:** See [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](./Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md) for suggestions.
- **Adjust your video settings:** Low bandwidth, limited memory, or not enough processing power can impact game performance. See [Optimizing Video Settings and Performance in Minecraft](./Optimizing-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md) for tips.
- **Run the Xbox Gaming Services Repair tool (PC only): **This tool can help sort out problems with Minecraft or the Launcher after installation or an update. Use it on the [Gaming Services Repair Tool for PC page](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/troubleshooting/gaming-services-repair-tool).
- **Disable add-ons:** If you are running a lot of modifications in your world, these third-party applications may not play nice with each other and other systems. You can try turning enhancements on and off. See [Disabling Minecraft Add-Ons](../Managing-Marketplace-Content/Disabling-Minecraft-Add-Ons.md) for information.
- **Wait and try again:** Temporary server outages are announced on the [PlayFab](https://status.playfab.com/) and/or [Xbox Live](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status) status pages. If there is an outage, you will need to wait until it has been resolved.

## Named Error Code Troubleshooting

Some errors are so special, we’ve given them names and their own help articles. Refer to the list below for tips on solving named errors.

### Bat: An account provider could not be found.

- Make sure you have the [Xbox App](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/xbox-app-for-pc) installed and you are signed in with your Microsoft account. You can find the app by searching for “Xbox” in your platform’s store app or in the Microsoft store.

### Cauldron: Minecraft could not reach the authentication servers or the connection has timed out.
