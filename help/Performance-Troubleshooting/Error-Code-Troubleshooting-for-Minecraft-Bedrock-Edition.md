## General Error Code Troubleshooting

Always make sure that your game is [up to date and running the latest version of Minecraft](../Download-Install/System-Requirements-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md).

Additionally, please confirm that your Minecraft account is attached to a Microsoft account. You can check this by going to the main menu, then clicking the sign-in button at the bottom right.

After verifying the above, please complete these troubleshooting steps:

- Check your internet and ensure your device's connection is stable and strong.
- If your issues are caused by the internet connection, you may need to reach out to your Internet Service Provider and/or complete separate troubleshooting steps.
- Sign out of all Minecraft accounts (including the attached Microsoft account) and close out any open Minecraft: Bedrock Edition applications.
- Restart the game, then sign back into your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Microsoft account(s)
- If you still see the error: repeat the steps above after waiting 1 hour, including internet troubleshooting steps.

Additional steps if you're playing on a Windows, Android, Xbox, or iOS device:

- Make sure you're logging in with the right Microsoft account.
- Install the "Xbox App", which you can find by searching for "Xbox" in your platform's store app or in the Microsoft Store.

If you find the issue persists after this point, we have a few additional suggestions that may assist with resolving the problem. Please read our guidance carefully and only proceed with the steps you are comfortable processing.
