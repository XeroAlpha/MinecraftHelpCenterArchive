If you want to play on Realms or with friends on different platforms in Minecraft on PlayStation, you will need to link a Microsoft account. Here is how to do that.

### How to connect your Microsoft account to PlayStation in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

1.  Launch Minecraft on your PlayStation.
2.  Select **Sign in with a Microsoft account** on the title screen.
3.  Visit the [code redemption site on a browser](https://login.live.com/oauth20_remoteconnect.srf).
4.  Input the code that your game is displaying.
5.  Sign in to the Microsoft account you want associated with your PlayStation account.

**Note:** only one Microsoft account can be associated with any PlayStation account at any one time. If the account you are trying to sign into has already been linked, you will need to use a different one.

After your Microsoft account has been signed in, you will be able to access your Realms and non-exclusive Marketplace content from other Bedrock versions on your PlayStation. However, any Minecoins you purchased on another version of Bedrock will not be usable on PlayStation. Only Minecraft Tokens can be used in the Minecraft Store on PlayStation. See [What are Minecraft Tokens?](../Minecraft-Marketplace/What-are-Minecraft-Tokens.md) for more info.

## Unlinking Accounts

You can link and unlink accounts at any time. Marketplace purchases made with a Microsoft account stay with that account. You will have access to marketplace items on your PlayStation while the accounts are linked. If you decide to disconnect your Microsoft account from your PlayStation account, all entitlements to Marketplace content will remain with the Microsoft account and will no longer be accessible on PlayStation. Marketplace purchases also cannot be transferred between accounts.

### How to unlink your Microsoft account in Minecraft on PlayStation

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Go to the **Account** tab.
4.  Select **Unlink Microsoft Account**.
5.  Read through and check the boxes warning you of the content you miss out on by unlinking your account.
6.  Press **Unlink**.
