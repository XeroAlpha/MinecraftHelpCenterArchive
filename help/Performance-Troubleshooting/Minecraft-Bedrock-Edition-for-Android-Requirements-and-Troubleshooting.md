This article provides Android technical support processes for you to follow as well as general knowledge about Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on Android devices.

## Minimum specifications to play Minecraft on Android

Below are the minimum specifications for Minecraft on your Android device. Our ability to support the Android devices using Open GL ES 3.0 and Android OS 8 and below is coming to an end. Devices that meet these criteria will receive their final Minecraft update in March 2025.

## Android Devices Minimum Specifications

- Operating System: Android OS 9
- Memory: More than 1GB of RAM
- Storage: 1 GB or higher
- Graphics: OpenGL ES 3.1 or higher

## Troubleshooting performance issues on supported devices

If you are on a device that meets the above specs and are still experiencing issues, see [Optimizing Video Settings and Performance in Minecraft](./Optimizing-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md) for tips on improving your performance.

## Information about sunset devices

After you receive a final Minecraft update for your sunset operating system, you will still be able to play on your worlds and access Marketplace purchases (including Minecoins). Realms managed with a device running a sunset operating system will continue to work for 6 months unless they are updated by the Realm owner on a different device. To cancel your Realms subscription, see [Cancel Realms Subscriptions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/36000025812877).

After an OS is sunset, your device will no longer receive the latest Minecraft updates and will be unable to play multiplayer with devices that are continuing to receive updates. You also will lose access to certain servers.
