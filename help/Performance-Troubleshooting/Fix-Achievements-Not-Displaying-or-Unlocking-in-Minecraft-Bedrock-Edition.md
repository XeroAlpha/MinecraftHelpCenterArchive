If you finish an achievement and it doesn’t unlock, you may need to sign in or update Minecraft. First, make sure you meet the requirements to [Unlock Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Achievements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/4409244237325), then see the suggestions below if needed.

## Fix Minecraft: Bedrock achievements not unlocking

- **Verify achievements are not disabled**: To see if achievements are disabled in your world, pause the game and select **Settings. **The **World: Game** section will display the banner "Achievements cannot be earned in this world" if achievements are disabled. [Restore or Recreate a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition World](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/43622310316045) to reenable achievements.
- **Verify your internet connection**: [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/30437628422413) includes recommended and required network settings that Minecraft needs to unlock achievements. For Xbox players, see [Troubleshoot your Xbox network connection](https://support.xbox.com/help/hardware-network/connect-network/xbox-one-network-connection).
- **Update Minecraft to the latest version**: If automatic updates are enabled, restart Minecraft (and the launcher on PC/Mac) to receive updates. Otherwise, see [Manually Update Minecraft on Mobile Devices](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/4409172223501), [Manually Update Minecraft on Consoles](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/27914177012749), or [Manually Update Minecraft on Windows](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/25519964899597) to update your device.
- **Verify your Microsoft account sign-in**: You need to sign in using a Microsoft account to unlock achievements. See [Use or Link Microsoft Accounts](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/sections/29296773863181) for information.

After following these steps, see if the achievement shows up as unlocked or reattempt the achievement to see if it unlocks as expected.
