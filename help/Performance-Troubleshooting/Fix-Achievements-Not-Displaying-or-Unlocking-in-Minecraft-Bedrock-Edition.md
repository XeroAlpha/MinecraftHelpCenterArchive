If you completed an achievement requirement and it does not unlock automatically, make sure you meet the requirements to [Unlock Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Achievements](./Unlock-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Achievements.md), then see the suggestions below if needed.

## Fix Minecraft: Bedrock achievements not unlocking

- **Verify achievements are not disabled**: To see if achievements are disabled in your world, pause the game and select **Settings.** The **World: Game** section displayes the banner “Achievements cannot be earned in this world.” If Achievements were disabled for any of the following reasons, you need to revert to a backup before these settings were enbled, use a world seed to recreate the world, or create a new world:
  - **World settings:** Settings such as creative mode, flat world, and enabling cheats or experiments will disable Achievements. 
  - **Marketplace items:** Some Marketplace add-ons or world templates may be incompatible with Achievements.
- **Verify your internet connection**: See [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](./Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md) for recommendation and required network settings. For Xbox players, see [Troubleshoot your Xbox network connection](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/connect-network/xbox-one-network-connection).
- **Update Minecraft to the latest version**: If automatic updates are enabled, restart Minecraft (and the launcher on PC/Mac) to receive updates. Otherwise, see [Manually Update Minecraft on Mobile Devices](../Download-Install/Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Mobile-Devices.md), [Manually Update Minecraft on Consoles](../Download-Install/Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Consoles.md), or [Manually Update Minecraft on Windows](../Download-Install/Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Windows.md) to update your device.
- **Verify your Microsoft account sign-in**: You need to sign in using a Microsoft account to unlock achievements. See [Use or Link Microsoft Accounts](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/sections/29296773863181) for information.

After following these steps, see if the achievement shows up as unlocked or reattempt the achievement to see if it unlocks as expected.
