If you receive a Cauldron error message in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, it means the game could not reach the authentication servers or the connection has timed out. This may be caused by a temporary service outage, internet issues, or account or device issues.

## General Error Code Troubleshooting

The first steps for restoring your connection to Minecraft services involves completely signing out of Minecraft and other services, restarting your system, and attempting to sign in again. Specific guidance is available in [General Error Code Troubleshooting](./Error-Code-Troubleshooting-for-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md#general-error-code-troubleshooting).

## Check Minecraft services

If your Cauldron error is caused by a temporary service outage, it will be reported in the following sources:

- [PlayFab Status](https://status.playfab.com/)
- [Xbox Live Status](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status)

If an outage has been reported, you will need to wait until the outage has been resolved.
