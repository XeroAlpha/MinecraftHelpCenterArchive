*Mojira is changing to a new cloud-based server. If you regularly help us by submitting bugs, be sure to migrate your bug tracker account by January 31, 2025. See [Changes to our bug reporting system](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/changes-to-minecraft-bug-reporting-system) for more.*

 

The [Mojang Bug Tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa) (also known by its nickname Mojira) is the place where all bugs in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and other games created by Mojang Studios are reported, documented, and tracked. Working together, we can squash these bugs as quickly as possible!

## What to Report on the Bug Tracker

We only accept reports about bugs. A bug is something in the game not behaving the way it should, due to a problem with the game's code. As such, it should be reproducible and not be caused by circumstances outside of the game such as network connections or customer support issues. Keeping the bug tracker focused on true bugs helps to get them addressed faster by Mojang Studios.

The following types of issues are **NOT** bugs and are not allowed on the bug tracker:

- **Minecraft account or payment issues**
  - If you have trouble accessing your Minecraft account, or if you have payment or purchase issues (including Realms and Marketplace), contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus).
- **Suggestions and feature requests**
  - To suggest a new feature for Minecraft, or to post a suggestion, do so on the official [Minecraft feedback site](https://feedback.minecraft.net/).
- **General connection issues (Realms, Marketplace) and authentication issues**
  - These issues are typically outside the control of the game’s code and are usually due to server maintenance, downtime, or local network configuration. For troubleshooting tips, see [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](./Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md).

## Searching for bugs

Before reporting a bug, always search for an existing report. There’s a chance that someone has already started the conversation on the bug. Here are a few tips on searching for existing bug reports:

- Use as few keywords as possible. The search engine will only find bug reports containing all the words in your query. For example, search for “squid suffocate” instead of “Squid will frequently suffocate for no reason when swimming around in a river”.
- Verify all words are spelled correctly.
- Try multiple separate searches using synonyms. For example, “workstation”, “job site”, and “profession block”.

If you find that your issue has already been reported, look at the Resolution of the report to determine what steps to take next.

## Reporting a bug

Here are some things to keep in mind before you report a new bug.

- **Write a concise summary** that clearly states the problem. Include as much important information as possible including:
  - Steps taken to reproduce the issue.
  - What happens when the bug occurs.
  - Clear screenshots or short video of the bug.
  - The exact text of any error messages.
- **If you have discovered an exploitive or security issue**, set the bug report’s security level to *Private* so that only you, Mojang Studios employees, and bug tracker moderators are able to view your bug report.
- **We only accept bug reports in English**; do not create bug reports in other languages.
- **Only put one issue into each bug report**. We will not accept your bug report if you include multiple bugs.
- **If you are using any mods or third-party tools**, see if the issue persists in a completely unmodified Minecraft environment before reporting it. If it doesn't, report the bug to the mod creator, not Mojang Studios.
- **Worlds that have been opened with a third-party tool are not supported**.
- **If you have an issue on a large multiplayer server** (like Hypixel or The Hive), contact the server staff first before creating a bug report.
- **Only report a bug if you are sure that it is still active in the latest version of the game**. We do not accept bug reports for any versions except for the latest release and the latest development version.
- **Watch for related emails or regularly check the bug report** for updates or potential further inquiries after creating a bug report.
