If you’re experiencing crashes or lag in Minecraft, here are some device, internet, and software tips that may help.

## Optimize your device

- **Check available storage space:** Confirm your file storage space and memory meet or exceed minimum requirements and free up space if you are low.
- **Run available updates:** Download and install any recommended operating system updates.
- **Update graphics drivers:** Make sure install the most recent graphics drivers. Here are common providers for PC and Mac: [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html), [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/), [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html).
- **Close other programs**: Close any active, non-Minecraft apps or programs that may be using memory and processor resources.
- **Unplug mobile devices:** Mobile phones and tables may have reduced processing power or overheat while actively charging.

## Optimize your internet connection

- **Disconnect other network devices:** Other devices connected to your home network downloading software or steaming video can reduce bandwidth available for playing Minecraft.
- **Check your internet speed:** Run a speed test recommended by your internet provider to verify the strength and speed of your internet connection.
- **Verify wireless connection strength:** If your gaming device isn’t near your router, you could experience decreased performance when playing on a wireless network.

## Optimize Minecraft and settings

- **Update Minecraft:** Make sure you're using the latest release of the game for your gaming device.
- **Shut down and restart:** Sign out of Minecraft, then shut down and restart your gaming device.
- **Disable add-ons or mods:** Running multiple enhancements may cause conflicts. Try disabling and re-adding add-ons or modification one at a time to see if that improves performance. See [Disabling Minecraft Add-Ons](../Managing-Marketplace-Content/Disabling-Minecraft-Add-Ons.md).
- **Adjust video settings**: Advanced video features require more processing power and memory. See [Optimizing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Video Settings and Performance](./Optimizing-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md) or [Optimizing Minecraft: Java Edition Video Settings and Performance](./Optimizing-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md) for tips.
- **Uninstall and reinstall:** If other tips aren’t working, you can always start with a fresh installation of Minecraft. Make sure that you [back up your Worlds and save data](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125) first.
