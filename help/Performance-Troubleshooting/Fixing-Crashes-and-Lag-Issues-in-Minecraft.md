If you’re experiencing crashes or lag in Minecraft, here are some device, internet, and software tips that may help. We also recommend trying to [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](./Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md), as improving your internet connection can reduce lag issues.

## Sign out and restart your device

Before trying more advanced troubleshooting steps, we recommend signing out of Minecraft and restarting your device, internet, Minecraft, and any associated programs.

1.  **Sign out and close programs**: [Reset Your Microsoft Account Sign-in in Minecraft](../Account-Sign-in/Reset-Your-Microsoft-Account-Sign-in-in-Minecraft.md) and sign out of the Microsoft store, the Xbox app, and any running Minecraft services, then close those programs.
2.  **Shut down your device**: Turn off your computer, mobile device, or game console.
3.  **Restart your Internet connection**: Turn off your router and modem, wait 20 seconds for power to cycle off, and restart them.
4.  **Restart your device and relaunch Minecraft**: Restart your gaming device, connect to the internet, launch Minecraft, and sign in with your Microsoft account.

If doing a complete device and network restart didn’t improve Minecraft’s performance, see the additional suggestions below.

## Optimize your device

- **Use a personal device:** Work or school devices may have restrictions that can prevent Minecraft from running properly.
- **Check available storage space:** Confirm your file storage space and memory meet or exceed [minimum requirements](../Download-Install/System-Requirements-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md) and free up space if you are low.
- **Run available updates:** Download and install any recommended operating system updates.
- **Update graphics drivers:** Install the newest graphics drivers directly from the manufacturer. Visit [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html), [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/), or [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) depending on your graphics processor.
- **Close other programs**: Close any active, non-Minecraft apps or programs that may be using memory and processor resources.
- **Unplug your device (mobile only):** Phones and tablets may have reduced processing power or overheat while actively charging.

## Optimize Minecraft and settings

- **Update Minecraft:** Make sure you're using the latest Minecraft release for your gaming device. See our [Download & Install](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166490706957) section for device-specific instructions.
- **Shut down and restart:** Sign out of Minecraft, then shut down and restart your gaming device.
- **Disable Add-Ons or mods:** Try disabling and re-adding Add-Ons or mods one at a time to see if performance improves. For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, see [Disabling Minecraft Add-Ons](../Managing-Marketplace-Content/Disable-Minecraft-Add-Ons-to-Solve-Game-Issues.md).
- **Adjust video settings**: Minecraft's advanced video features require more processing power and memory. See [Optimizing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Video Settings and Performance](./Optimizing-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md) or [Optimizing Minecraft: Java Edition Video Settings and Performance](./Optimizing-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md).
- **Uninstall and reinstall:** If other tips aren’t working, start with a fresh installation of Minecraft. See [Backup & Restore](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125) for instructions to save your worlds.
