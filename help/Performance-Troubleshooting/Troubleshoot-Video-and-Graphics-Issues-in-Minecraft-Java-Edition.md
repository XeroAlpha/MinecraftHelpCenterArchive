*For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, see* [*Troubleshooting Video and Graphics Issues in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition*](./Troubleshooting-Graphics-Issues-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md)*.*

If you experience performance issues, such as stuttering frame rate, or receive a Pixel format not accelerated error, you may have outdated software or outdated drivers. Below, we have listed common fixes to resolve these problems.

## Check for System Issues

- **Install operating system updates:** Check to make sure your computer is running the most recent version of your operating system. You should accept and install system updates and then restart your computer.
- **Verify version and minimum requirements**: Verify your system meets [minimum system requirements](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc?tabs=%7B%22details%22%3A1%7D#accordionv1-b6c8df09da-item-7739893325:~:text=Windows%2010%20system%20requirements) to play Java Edition. We also recommend playing the most recent version of Minecraft: Java Edition with the latest fixes and updates.
- **Update graphics drivers**: Windows PC players can find updated drivers here: [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html), [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx), or [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/).
- **Disconnect external input devices:** Controllers, headsets, and USB devices may be detected as game inputs and cause issues. Unplug the devices and restart Minecraft to see if that solves the issue.

## Change Minecraft game settings

- **Adjust video settings:** See [Optimizing Minecraft: Java Edition Video Settings and Performance.](https://help.minecraft.net/en-us/articles/36136728320013-Optimizing-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance)
- **Disable Mods:** Enabling [mods in your Java Edition game](./Mods-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md) may cause lag and affect gameplay. Disable or remove any active mods and see if that improves performance.
