Your achievements are listed in your Minecraft Profile under the **Profile** button on your launch screen. You can also find it in your in-game menu when you press **Esc**. If you find that when you reach an in-game objective the achievement is not immediately unlocked, be sure to allow up to 24 hours for the achievement to display. After that, if achievements are still not displaying in-game for you, try the following options:

- Make sure you are connected to the internet and that your game is up to date.
- - For more help on Xbox, [Troubleshoot your Xbox network connection](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/connect-network/xbox-one-network-connection).
- Restart your device and boot-up Minecraft again.
- If possible, reattempt the feat that gained you the achievement.
- [Back up your save data](../Backup-Restore/Locating-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Files-for-Backup-or-Transfer.md) and uninstall Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and reinstall it on your system.

If playing on PC, you can also check to make sure your Xbox services are live. Follow these steps:

1.  Press the **Windows key + R** simultaneously.
2.  Type **services.msc**.
3.  Press **Ok**.
4.  Find the following services in the list:
    - Connected User Experiences and Telemetry
    - Xbox Live Auth Manager
    - Xbox Live Networking Service
5.  If any of the above say something under their status besides **Running**, double-click them.
6.  Select **Automatic** under Startup type.
7.  Press Apply then **Ok**.
8.  Select **Start the service** on each of the services that are not running.
