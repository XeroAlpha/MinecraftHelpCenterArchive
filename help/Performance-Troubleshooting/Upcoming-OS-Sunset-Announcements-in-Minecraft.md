As Minecraft grows, so must the operating system that supports it. As of March 2025, the below operating systems provide the minimum specifications to receive future Minecraft updates:

- Android
  - Operating System: Android OS 9
  - Memory: More than 1GB of RAM
  - Storage: 1 GB or higher
  - Graphics: OpenGL ES 3.1 or higher
- Apple
  - iOS/iPadOS 14 and above
- Amazon
  - Amazon Fire OS 7 or above
  - Graphics: OpenGL ES 3.1 or higher
- Chromebooks
  - Graphics: OpenGL ES 3.1 or higher

## Minecraft Launcher minimum OS requirements

Minecraft Launcher users will need to update to the below operating systems to continue receiving updates after March 2025.

- Mac
  - Mac 10.15 or higher
- Ubuntu
  - Ubuntu 19.10 or higher
- Windows PCs
  - Windows 10 or higher

Additionally, the following devices will no longer receive future updates after March 2025 and will no longer be supported:

- PlayStation VR
- OpenXR
- ARM32 processors

After you receive a final Minecraft update for your sunset operating system, you will still be able to play on your worlds and access Marketplace purchases (including Minecoins). Realms managed with a device running a sunset operating system will continue to work for 6 months unless they are updated by the Realm owner on a different device. To cancel your Realms subscription, see [How to Cancel a Minecraft Realms Subscription](../Manage-Realms-Subscriptions/How-to-Cancel-a-Minecraft-Realms-Subscription.md).

After an OS is sunset, your device will no longer receive the latest Minecraft updates and will be unable to play multiplayer with devices that are continuing to receive updates. You also will lose access to certain servers.
