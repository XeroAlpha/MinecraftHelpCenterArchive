Your time in Minecraft should be filled with countless adventures and stories to tell about them! The Trails & Tales update helps facilitate that by providing you with all new features like a beautiful pink wood, a new mob with quite the nose on them, and more! Here is everything that the Trails & Tales update brought.

## Archaeology

Get your hands on a brush and swipe away at suspicious gravel and sand blocks to find shattered pottery sherds.

## Armor Trimming

Personalize your armor more than ever before! Armor trimming provides a bit of flair to your armor sets, allowing you to stand out from the crowd.

## Bamboo Set

Prepare for an exciting new material set. The bamboo set brings you new materials for building structures, and even a raft for exploring the seas.

## Camel

The camel mob can be saddled and ridden by two people at once! Plus, it is so tall that melee mobs like zombies won’t be able to reach you with their attacks.

## Cherry Grove

This beautiful new biome brings a pink tint to the trees of Minecraft. Discover the cherry grove biome and all of the wooden items you can craft!

## Chiseled Bookshelves

Chiseled bookshelves are the ultimate way to build your library. These new block types allow you and your friends to store and retrieve books of all kinds! Store your secret texts in a hidden dungeon, or use these shelves to hold instructional information for players new to your Realm. The possibilities are endless!

## Hanging Signs

Hanging signs are exactly what they sound like – signs that hang! Now, you can place signs under or to the side of a block or a fence. Yup. That means you can hang a sign from your ceiling or simply place one on the side of your base. In fact, you can even attach hanging signs to other hanging signs, creating a whole chain of signs! That’s a lot of words.

## Torchflower and Pitcher Plant

The torchflower and pitcher plant are new flowers to plant in your farmland and bring more life to your base.

The torchflower seed can be used to breed and tempt sniffers, and must be planted on farmland to grow into its flower form. Once fully grown, the torchflower can be harvested, replanted, and even used for dye!

The pitcher plant begins as a seed pod, and you can plant it on farmland to watch it grow through a few different stages. Or, you can use the pod to feed chickens and parrots. Once fully grown, you can harvest the pitcher and place it as you would a normal Minecraft flower!

## Playable Mob Sounds

Looking to scare your friends? Mob heads now play sounds when you place them on note blocks.

## The Sniffer

Sniffers are unique creatures that will wander around the Overworld looking for areas to dig up Torchflower Seeds and Pitcher Pods. When an adult Sniffer lowers its head to the ground above a block that it can dig in, it will produce one of the ancient seeds for you to pick up.
