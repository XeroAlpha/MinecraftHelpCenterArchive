The Tricky Trials update in Minecraft adds all kinds of new features. Whether you want to get the drop (literally) on mobs with the new mace weapon or make a production line with the crafter, there is lots to do! Look below for a breakdown on all Minecraft 1.21 Tricky Trials features.

## Wind Charge

Crafted from breeze rods (dropped by the breeze), the wind charge projectile lets you blast foes with gusts of wind and send them flying. Plus, the knockback from the wind charge can also trigger traps and boost your jumping ability.

## Vault

The vault is a block that makes multiplayer adventuring rewarding for everyone! This loot-filled block is found in trial chambers. Unlike chests, which can be emptied, the vault rewards loot once to every player that unlocks it with a trial key.

## Trial Spawner

Found in the trial chambers, the trial spawner is a cunning device that spews out waves of hostile mobs based on the size of your party. Fight your way to victory for a chance to claim a trial key – used to unlock rewards from vaults!

## Trial Chambers

Discover the trial chambers, an underground structure stuffed with traps, tricky combat challenges, and treasure! Each sprawling structure is randomly generated, so you'll face different challenges each time. Triumph to reap the rewards!

## Pottery Shards, Armor Trims, and Banner Designs

The Tricky Trials Update brings new pottery sherds to collect, new armor trims to covet, and breeze-themed banner designs to decorate your base with. Show that you've bested the trial chambers by boasting the flow or bolt armor trims. Declare yourself a breeze fan with two new banner designs, or simply updated your decorated pot collection with three trial-themed sherds.

## Ominous Trials

Face an ominous trial if you dare! Drink an ominous bottle and then head into the trial chambers, and you'll discover an even trickier challenge. In an ominous trial the trial spawners will spew out tougher mobs, as well as potions and projectiles. Triumph for a chance to claim the ominous trial key, and unlock rewards fitting for your feat!

## The Mace

Wield the mace, a weapon coming with the Tricky Trials Update! Attack from above and time it just right to knock back your enemies – because the longer you fall, the harder you hit. You can even make the mace stronger with three unique enchantments: Density for increased smash damage when falling, Wind Burst for a chance to chain your smash attacks, and Breach for penetrating armor!

## The Crafter

The crafter uses redstone for automated crafting. Pick a recipe, add stacks of ingredients, supply a redstone pulse, and tada! In just a few ticks, your auto-crafted item will pop out into the Minecraft world.

## Copper Bulb

The copper bulb is a light source that can be toggled on and off using redstone pulses. Wax it, scrape it, or leave it to oxidize, and see how the changing patina affects the bulb’s light levels! Unlike redstone lamps, the copper bulb can stay lit even without an active redstone signal, as all it needs is an initial pulse!

## The Breeze

Do battle with the breeze – a mischievous mob found in the trial chambers, whose wind attacks will send you flying! Nimble and immune to projectiles, this mob is a tough foe, but the breeze rod it drops can be used to craft wind-harnessing weapons.

## The Bogged

Put your dodging skills to the test and face off against a fearsome foe found in trial chambers: the bogged! Clad in mossy rags with a body sprouting mushrooms, this skeleton shoots poison arrows. Fight it, shear it – but certainly fear it!
