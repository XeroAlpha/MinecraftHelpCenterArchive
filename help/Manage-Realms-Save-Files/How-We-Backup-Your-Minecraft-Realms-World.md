Minecraft Realms automatically creates a backup save of your world at regular intervals. This allows you to restore your world if something goes wrong. You can also [Create a Manual Save of Your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms World](./Create-a-Manual-Save-of-Your-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-World.md) or [Download a Realms world in Minecraft: Java Edition.](./Download-a-Realms-world-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md)

We automatically save your progress:

- Every 30 minutes
- When you select Save & Quit in the menu screen  
- Any time you disconnect from your Realm.

We can’t keep all of your saves around forever, so the following retention policy is in place:

- The four most recent saves are retained.
- In the last 24 hours: We retain one save every 4 hours.
- 1 day to 8 days ago: We retain one save per day.
- 9 days to 36 days ago: We retain one save per week.
- 37 days to 121 days ago: We retain one save per month.
- 122+ days ago: No saves are retained.

A Realm world is downloadable within 18 months of your subscription expiring, but the world backups associated with that Realm will be deleted 30 days after your subscription expires.
