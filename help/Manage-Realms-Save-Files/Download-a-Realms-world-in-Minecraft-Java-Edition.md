Minecraft Realms worlds are backed up automatically to help you keep your creations safe. When you finish playing and select Quit & Save, the most recent version of your world is saved to your backups. To download and make a copy of a Realms world, follow the instructions below.

2.  Select the Realm with the world you want to download, then select **Configure**.
3.  Select **World Backups**.
4.  Select **Download Latest**.

The world will be downloaded and added to your singleplayer worlds. See [Locating Minecraft: Java Edition Files for Backup or Transfer](../Backup-Restore/Find-Your-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Backup-World.md) for more details.
