Minecraft Realms worlds are backed up automatically to help you keep your creations safe. When you finish playing and select Quit & Save, the most recent version of your world is saved to your backups. To download and make a copy of a Realms world, follow the instructions below.

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Play**.
2.  Select the **Realms** tab.
3.  Select the Realm with the world you want to download and select **Settings**.
4.  Select the world you want to download and select **Edit world**.
5.  Scroll to the bottom of Game Settings and select the Download World button.

The world will be downloaded and added to your Worlds tab and can also be copied from your file storage.
