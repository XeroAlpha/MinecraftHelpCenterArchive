Minecraft Player Care uses transaction IDs to verify ownership of Mojang accounts and Minecraft purchases made before July 25, 2022. [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/get-help-with-your-microsoft-account-ace6f3b3-e2d3-aeb1-6b96-d2e9e7e52133) uses transaction IDs to troubleshoot problems with Minecraft purchases made in the Microsoft store after that date. Minecraft Player Care cannot provide account support for purchases from the Microsoft store or those made from a [non-authorized website, reseller, or another player](./Can-I-Buy-or-Sell-Minecraft-Accounts.md).

### How to Find a Transaction ID

There are few ways to find your transaction ID:

- **Purchase Confirmation Email**: Search your email accounts for “Minecraft” or the payment processors listed below to identify purchase confirmation emails that contain a transaction ID and order number.
- **PIN or Gift Code**: A gift code or PIN from a Minecraft prepaid card used to purchase Minecraft.
- **Payment Processor**: Check with your bank, credit card, or other payment processor to get purchase information.

### Identifying Transaction IDs

You can search your email for the following payment processors and look for transaction IDs in the following formats:

PayPal

- PayPal transaction ID example: 1AB23456C7890123D
- PayPal receipt number example: 1234-5678-9012-3456

Braintree

- Braintree transaction ID example: 1a2bcd3

Skrill (Formerly Moneybookers)

### Identifying a digital gift code

Minecraft gift codes can be used to verify account ownership. Check your email accounts for Minecraft gift codes or ask the gift giver if they have a record of the gift.

Gift codes purchased after September 2015 have 5 sets of 5 characters:

- Gift code example: A1B2C-D3E4F-G5H6I-J7K8L-M9N0P

Gift codes purchased before October 2015 have three sets of four characters.

- Pre-October 2015 gift code example: B2C3-D4F6-G7H8

To recover a gift code that you can no longer access, ask the person who gave it to you to retrieve it from [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com/) in their account overview.

### Identifying a Prepaid card PIN

Minecraft prepaid cards are physical cards available for purchase in select retail stores and have PIN numbers that are a ten-digit number or five sets of five letters and numbers. Search your email accounts for a message confirming redemption of a Minecraft prepaid card PIN.

- Ten-digit PIN example: 123 456 7890
- Five sets of five letters and numbers PIN example: A1B2C-D3E4F-G5H6I-J7K8L-M9N0P
