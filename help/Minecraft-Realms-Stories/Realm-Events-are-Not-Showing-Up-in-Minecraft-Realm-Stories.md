To take advantage of all the Minecraft Realm Stories features, use Realm Events to keep a record of your game progress. These posts will give all members big updates on happenings in your Realm.

**Note:** Realms Stories is exclusive to Bedrock Edition, so you will not be able to see Realm Events when playing Realms in Minecraft: Java Edition.

If you donâ€™t see any Events in your Realms Stories, first make sure that the feature is turned on.

## How to disable or re-enable Realm Events in Minecraft

**By default, Realm Events will be enabled.** Do the following if you want to turn them off or restart them.

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the **Realms Stories** icon (open book next to your Realm).
4.  Select the **Realms Stories Settings** icon (three lines in the top right corner).
5.  Locate **Realm Events**.

After adjusting your Realm Events, you will need to close and open your Realm for the change to take effect.

## How to close and open your Minecraft Realm

1.  Select the **Edit Realm** icon.
2.  Select **Manage Realm**.
3.  Enter **Subscription**.
4.  Select **Close Realm**.
5.  After the Realm closes, select **Open Realm**.

**Note:** Some Realm Events will only appear in your stories once per world.
