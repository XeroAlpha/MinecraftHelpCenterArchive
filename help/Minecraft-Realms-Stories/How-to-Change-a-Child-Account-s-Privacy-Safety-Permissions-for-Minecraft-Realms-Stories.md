This article covers how you can change your Privacy & Safety permissions to utilize Minecraft Realms Stories and join Realms. If you want to know more about safety while playing Minecraft Realms, see [Minecraft Realms Safety.](../General-Safety/Minecraft-Realms-Safety.md)

While this article focuses on changing a child account’s permissions from the viewpoint of the family organizer, a solo account that is not part of a family group can adjust their settings if needed this way as well.

### Changing permissions for your family’s Microsoft accounts on a web browser

1.  To change the permissions for anyone within your family group, the family organizer will need to go to the [Privacy & Online Safety page](https://account.xbox.com/en-us/settings?gamertag=REV+X+SHADOWS&activetab=main%3aprivacytab) and sign in with the family organizer account. 
2.  Select the account within the family that you want to adjust. Below that selection, click on **Xbox Series X\|S, Xbox One, and Windows 10 devices Online Safety.**
3.  In the list below the Online Safety tab are numerous settings that decide how much that account can interact with other online accounts. For the purposes of Minecraft Realms Stories, you will want to set the following sections to **Allow**:
    - **You can create and join clubs.**
    - **You can join multiplayer games.**
    - **You can upload captures to Xbox Live.**
4.  Scroll to the bottom and click **Submit** to save your changes. 
5.  Restart Minecraft using the child account to apply changes.

  
View [Manage Who Can See your Profile in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Manage-Your-Profile-on-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) to further protect your child’s account profile in-game.
