You can change Privacy & Safety permissions to manage access to Minecraft Realms and Realms Stories features. If you want to know more about safety while playing Minecraft Realms, see [Minecraft Realms Safety](../Create-or-Join-Realms/Minecraft-Realms-Safety.md).

Minecraft uses Microsoft account and Xbox features to enable parental control. You can use the Xbox website and app to manage access to Minecraft social features even if you do not own an Xbox. Most features are enabled by default on adult accounts but feature access can be managed on any account type.

## Required settings for Minecraft Realms Stories

All of the settings below must be set to **Allow** for a child account to access Realms, share screen shots, and see other friends stories. Setting names may vary depending on which tool you use.

- **You can create and join clubs** or **Join clubs**: This controls the ability to join and share in Realms Stories
- **You can upload captures to Xbox Live** or **See and upload community creations**: This controls the ability to upload in-game screenshots
