This article covers how you can change your Privacy & Safety permissions to utilize Minecraft Realms Stories and join Realms. If you want to know more about safety while playing Minecraft Realms, see [Minecraft Realms Safety.](../Create-or-Join-Realms/Minecraft-Realms-Safety.md)

While this article focuses on changing a child account’s permissions from the viewpoint of the family organizer, a solo account that is not part of a family group can adjust their settings if needed this way as well.

## Changing permissions for your family’s Microsoft accounts on a web browser

1.  Visit the [Privacy & Online Safety page](https://account.xbox.com/en-us/settings?gamertag=REV+X+SHADOWS&activetab=main%3aprivacytab) and sign in with the family organizer account. 
2.  Select the account within the family that you want to adjust.
3.  Select the **Xbox Series X\|S, Xbox One, and Windows 10 devices Online Safety** tab.
4.  Select options that manage how that account can interact with other online accounts. For Minecraft Realms Stories, set the following sections to **Allow**:
    - **You can create and join clubs.**
    - **You can join multiplayer games.**
    - **You can upload captures to Xbox Live.**
5.  Scroll to the bottom and click **Submit** to save your changes. 
6.  Restart Minecraft and sign in using the child account to apply changes.

  
View [Manage Who Can See your Profile in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](../Account-Settings/Manage-Your-Profile-on-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) to further protect your child’s account profile in-game.
