If you have found something interesting or built a new epic structure in your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm, you can easily share a screenshot to your fellow Realms members through Realms Stories.

**How to take a screenshot in Minecraft**

1.  Enter the Realm.
2.  Position screen for what you want to capture.
3.  Bring up the menu.
4.  Select the **Camera** icon.

**How to share a screenshot to Realms Stories while in a Realm**

1.  Open your game menu.
2.  Select **Realms Stories**.
3.  Press **Add Story**.
4.  Select **Add screenshot**.
5.  Select the screenshot to share from your screenshot library.
6.  Write a description if you want and select **Post**.

**How to share a screenshot to Realms Stories when not in a Realm**

1.  Select the **Realms Stories** icon next to the Realm where you want to share a screenshot.
2.  Select **Add Story**.
3.  Select **Add screenshot**.
4.  Select the screenshot to share from your screenshot library.
5.  Write a description if you want and select **Post**.

If you cannot share to a Realm Story, you may need to adjust your permissions. Have the family organizer sign into their account and see [Managing Multiplayer Game Access For A Child Account In Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md) to adjust those settings.
