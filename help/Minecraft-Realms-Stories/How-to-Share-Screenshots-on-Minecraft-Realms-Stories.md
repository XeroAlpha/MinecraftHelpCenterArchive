If you found something interesting or built a new epic structure in your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm, you can easily share a screenshot with your fellow Realms members through Realms Stories.

## How to share an existing screenshot to Realms Stories while in a Realm

1.  Pause your game to open the game menu.
2.  Select **Realms** **Stories**.
3.  Select **Add** **Story**.
4.  Select **Add** **screenshot**.
5.  Select a screenshot to share from your screenshot library.
6.  Write an optional description for your screenshot and select **Post**.

## How to share a screenshot to Realms Stories when not in a Realm

1.  Select the **Realms** tab in the Play menu.
2.  Select the **Stories** button next to the Realm where you want to share a screenshot.
3.  Select **Add** **Story**.
4.  Select **Add** **screenshot**.
5.  Select the screenshot to share from your screenshot library.
6.  Write an optional description for your screenshot and select **Post**.

If you cannot share to a Realm Story, your permissions may need to be adjusted. Have the family organizer sign into their account and see [Managing Multiplayer Game Access For A Child Account In Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md) to adjust those settings.
