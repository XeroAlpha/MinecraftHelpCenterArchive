Realms Stories will keep a record of some of the biggest accomplishments that happen within your Realm. When you enable Show Coordinates in your Realm world settings, Realms Stories will record the location of certain Realm Events when they appear on your story feed. Here's how Realm owners can enable Show Coordinates.

## How to turn on Show Coordinates from the Play screen

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select **Realms** on the Play screen.
4.  Select the Realm you want to update and select **Settings**.
5.  Select your world and select **Edit World**.
6.  Select **Show Coordinates** under Game Settings.

## How to turn on Show Coordinates within your Realm world

1.  Activate the Pause screen while playing in your Realm
2.  Select **Settings** from the Pause screen.
3.  Find and select **Show Coordinates** under Game Settings.

**Note:** Not all Realm Events will include an accompanying set of coordinates. If you notice one story not showing where it happened, it may have just been because that event doesnâ€™t include the location.
