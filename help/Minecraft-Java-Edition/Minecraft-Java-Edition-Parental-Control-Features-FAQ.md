## Minecraft: Java Edition Player Safety Features

We want Minecraft: Java Edition to be a safe place for everyone. That's why we've added several player safety features to the game and will continue to add more in the future. 

**Note**: **It's highly recommended that you update to the latest version of the game, as it includes new security fixes and player safety updates, gameplay optimizations, and other great stuff.** 

## Overview of the Player Safety Features for Minecraft: Java Edition 

### Newer Game Versions (1.16.4 and up)

-   Parental controls, allowing guardians to disable the Chat and Multiplayer features for child accounts in your [Xbox account settings](http://account.xbox.com/settings).
-   The [Social Interactions screen](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Social_Interactions_screen), which enables you to view all players on the server, hide their chat messages, or block them using your Microsoft account.

Player safety features for versions earlier than 1.16.4 or modded game versions are not available. 

## Mojang Accounts for Users Under 13

We manage data for children under 13 years of age as required by U.S. law. It\'s a bit more lawyer-y than we would usually post, but it\'s very clear about everything, so please bear with us as you read it. If you don't find the answer to your questions here, you can contact Minecraft Support with the link at the bottom of the page.

### Why is Mojang Studios asking Mojang account owners to verify their ages and provide a credit card? 

Mojang Studios is a subsidiary of Microsoft Studios. As a US company, Microsoft implements and follows certain procedures to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which is a U.S. law that helps protect children on the Internet. Under these policies, we obtain parental consent before any child under age 13 can access certain Mojang account features. The most common method allowed by COPPA for obtaining parental consent is charging a small amount to the parent's credit card. We verify the card by charging a ten cent, non-refundable fee. The credit card charge requirement applies only to accounts for children under age 13.

### What features are locked for players 13 and under? 

-   Playing on Minecraft Realms
-   Making purchases 
-   Changing settings on the Mojang account site

### Are there two different kinds of accounts, one for children and one for adults? 

No. Accounts that require parental consent and have not obtained it have certain features locked, but there are no additional parental controls, and if consent has been obtained, there is no difference from an account that does not require parental consent.

### What is COPPA? 

Established by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1998, the Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) provides a set of rules around the online collection of personal information from U.S. children under 13. COPPA spells out what a website operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent, and what responsibilities an operator must adhere to for protecting children\'s privacy and safety online. For more information, [visit the FTC\'s website](http://www.ftc.gov/).

### Who must comply with COPPA? 

Any U.S. company that operates a commercial website or an online service that collects, uses, or discloses personal information from U.S. children under age 13 and who is directed to children under 13 or has actual knowledge that a user is under 13 must comply with the Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act.

### Why are you requesting a credit card number to verify parental consent? 

The most common method allowed by COPPA for obtaining parental consent is charging a small amount to the parent's credit card. We verify the card by charging a ten cent, non-refundable fee. The credit card charge requirement only applies to accounts for children under age 13.

### Are parents charged for each child they sign up? 

Yes. Parental consent is verified for each child. The credit card fee is one of the verification methods approved by COPPA.

### Are you making money from this? 

No. The credit card transaction fees for obtaining parental consent cost Mojang more than ten cents, so we do not profit from this.

### Will the parent's credit card number be stored or remain on the account? 

No. Mojang Studios does not collect or store credit card information. Instead, encrypted credit card information is sent directly from your computer to a certified back-end processing agency that validates and charges the account.

However, Mojang Studios does allow users to elect to have future purchases/renewals charged to their account without requiring the user to reenter their credit card information. See [Saved Payment Information](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409234093581-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Account-FAQ#h_01FFK28B6YWNH1WAJB97ACRARA) for more.

### Do other companies charge this fee? 

Yes. Charging a credit card is the most commonly used method of verifying parental consent under COPPA.
