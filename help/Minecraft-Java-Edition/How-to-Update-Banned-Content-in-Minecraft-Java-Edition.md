If you have used skins or a player name that does not comply with the [Minecraft Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards), that content in particular may be banned and removed from use by you and all other users. Here is how to make updates if content is banned and removed:

## Change your username for Minecraft: Java Edition

If your Java username has been banned, you can change it by logging into your Microsoft account at the [Change Profile Name page on Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/mygames/editprofile). Name changes can only be done once every 30 days, so be sure to choose your new name wisely.

## Change skins in Minecraft: Java Edition

To change your Java skin, follow these directions:

1.  Open the Minecraft Launcher.
2.  Enter **Minecraft: Java Edition**.
3.  Click the **Skins** tab.
4.  Select a pre-made skin or upload a skin file.
