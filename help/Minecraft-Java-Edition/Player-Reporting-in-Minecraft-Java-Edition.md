Everyone should expect Minecraft: Java Edition to be a safe place to play. If a player makes you feel unsafe, insults you, or detracts from your experience in any way, you can report them using our in-game reporting tools. For more information about what may be considered inappropriate behavior, see [Guidelines for Reporting Inappropriate Player Behavior in Minecraft](../Manage-or-Troubleshoot-Realms/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Player-Reporting-FAQ.md).

## How to report a player in Java

1.  While in the game, press **P** to bring up the **Social Interactions** menu.
2.  Select **Report Player** next to the offender.
3.  Click on **Select Chat Messages** if you are reporting a chat message. If not, choose another option.
4.  Click **Select Report Category**. Choose the best option for the situation and select **Done**.
5.  While not mandatory, you can also describe the situation to better inform us of what happened so we can take proper action on their account.
6.  Click **Send Report** when done.

**Note:** As an alternative, you can always report a player using ourâ€¯[Report a Concern form](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4416074743565).
