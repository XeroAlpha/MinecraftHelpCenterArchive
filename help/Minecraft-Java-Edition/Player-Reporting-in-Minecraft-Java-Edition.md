Our games bring millions of players together from around the world, all united by the goal of crafting, exploring, and having fun. That's why it's so important that our games are a safe and welcoming place for all players.  

To achieve that, we have a dedicated team of passionate people that work every day to celebrate and protect our community's creativity and passion while ensuring interactions remain safe. As a part of that work, Mojang Studios moderates harmful content and behaviors that don't follow the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/) as explained in the Community Standards for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards) and [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/legal/community-standards), but we can't be everywhere at once. That's where you, our players, come in. You are our community, and you help us keep Minecraft: Java Edition fun and safe. 

We have also written up a [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7317376541197) about Player Reporting.

## Empowering fun, welcoming, and safe experiences

The goal of having effective and intuitive Player Reporting mechanisms in our games is to empower the community to let us know when harmful behavior is taking place and getting in the way of the fun and intended experiences in Minecraft: Java Edition. 

There are different ways to file a report. In addition to being able to use the existing [report a concern](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4416074743565) form and report a player in Minecraft, it is now possible to report a player for abusive messages in the Minecraft: Java Edition game client. 

You may also have seen our new profanity filter on Realms -- these two functions are different. A player report is always initiated by a player. No reports are created automatically. 

## Submitting a Player Report in Minecraft: Java Edition

When you submit a player report, you can either report individual chat messages, a player's skin, or a player's name that contains objectionable content. When reporting chat or a skin, you will also need to select a category for the report. All of this information is used to provide the best context for our moderation team to take action. 

In an effort to be clearer and more transparent with you, we have updated the messages displayed when an account is suspended or banned. Our goal is to ensure you know what type of action was taken and why, as well as any other relevant details. Being clear with you is an important part of our ongoing work to make Minecraft a safe and welcoming place for everyone.

Reporting can be accessed via the social interactions screen (default keybind is P) or via the pause menu. You can find out more about how to use the Player Reporting tool on the [How to Report a Player page](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/13019118732429).

## The Lifetime of a Player Report 

Let us walk through what happens when a player is reported. 

-   A player creates a report, selects the offending chat, name, or skin, a category and details, and submits it.

-   The report is sent to our team of Minecraft Investigators.

-   A moderator reviews the report and the evidence and assigns an appropriate action (if any). 

-   If action is taken, a moderator can take one of the following actions:

    -   Suspend the player from online play for some duration of time, or in extreme cases permanently

    -   Remove the player's skin and replace it with a default skin.

        -   This action applies to any player using the same skin, and future players will not be able to select it.

-   Suspend the player from online play until they change their username.
    -   No player will be allowed to use this name once it has been removed.

## Reviewing Reports

When chat reports are submitted, our team reviews not only the phrase reported, but the surrounding context and the authenticity of the report to determine if our community standards were violated.

## If you are Suspended, Name, or Skin Banned

When someone doesn't follow our community standards, it is possible that their account, name, or skin will get suspended. If this has happened to you, and you would like more information or would like to appeal the suspension, please submit a review via the [Case Review page](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360003469452).

You can change your skin at any time at [this link](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us).

You can change your name at any time at [this link](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us).

## Abuse of the Player Reporting System

You are responsible for the reports you submit. Knowingly sending incorrect reports to try to get another player banned, excessively sending irrelevant reports, or otherwise abusing the player reporting system can lead to repercussions for your account. Do not incite others into using the player reporting system for your sake.
