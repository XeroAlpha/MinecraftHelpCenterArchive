We are not able to view and assist with moderation issues on your Realm directly. However, we do have a guide to help you with some of the Realm moderation options built-in. You can access these options by clicking the Edit Realm Icon next to your Realm in the server list.

1.  Set "Guest" permissions by default - Invitees that join your Realm will be unable to make any changes to the world, such as breaking blocks, griefing, or making other undesirable changes.
2.  Restore from a previous backup - You may be able to roll back to a previous backup before any undesired changes were made.
3.  Realms also uses an invitation-only system that helps prevent unauthorized access. Access and per-player permissions can be managed through your Realms admin settings.
4.  You can also close the Realm - this prevents anyone from joining your Realm until you open it again.

You can also moderate your Realm through Minecraft.net. Check out the following articles for more information:
