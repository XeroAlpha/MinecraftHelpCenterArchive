*This article applies to Minecraft: Java Edition. If you’re experiencing slow gameplay in Minecraft Realms, please see *[Minecraft Realms Plus Troubleshooting](../Realms-Troubleshooting-and-Billing/Minecraft-Realms-Plus-Troubleshooting.md)*.*

Slow gameplay can be difficult to diagnose, but it is usually fixed by ensuring your computer meets the system requirements and has a steady broadband Internet connection. While there are many factors that could potentially contribute to slow gameplay in Minecraft, most of them can be sorted into two categories:

## Computer Processing (low framerate) 

If your computer does not meet the [minimum system requirements](./Minecraft-Java-Edition-Installation-Issues-FAQ.md#what-are-the-device-requirements-to-run-minecraft-java-edition), you will probably experience slower or choppy gameplay. When playing Minecraft, press F3 to view information about the game. Look at the top row and locate the FPS. If this number is lower than 30, the game may be running too slowly due to your software configuration or insufficient graphical and computer processing hardware.

You can also visit our list of [resources](./Minecraft-Java-Edition-Troubleshooting.md) (especially the forums) for further help.  

## Network Connection (latency or lag) 

This is usually caused by a slow or inconsistent Internet connection or by a slow server.  This means the information is not transferring between your computer and the server that you're playing on as quickly as it needs to.

While Minecraft may perform similarly to the issue categorized above, your framerate may not always be low, and you may experience characters "jumping" from location to location as the server and computer catch up. If you're experiencing slow performance due to connectivity, you may need to pause or stop any current downloads, change your network settings, or you may require a faster Internet connection.
