## I Cannot Connect to Game Services on Minecraft: Java Edition

If you are having issues connecting to one of our services relating to Minecraft: Java Edition, first check the [Mojang Status Twitter](https://twitter.com/MojangStatus). Mojang Studio servers automatically notify our web developers whenever there is a major outage, so if an outage continues, it's likely that the issue is being worked on. Please be patient and try again later. 

If you receive an error, but an outage has not been reported, check your Internet, antivirus, and/or firewall connections. You may need to refresh your profile's authentication and connection with our servers by logging out of the game and logging back in. You'll also need to make sure that your computer and network devices can send and receive data to the following services: 

- minecraftservices.com
- mojang.com
- minecraft.net
- s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftSkins

If the issue persists, try again later, or consult your system's Help resources on network settings.
