This article discusses solving your Minecraft: Java Edition multiplayer connection issues.

If you have successfully logged in to your game, you can still encounter communication problems between your computer/network and the server you are trying to connect to.

## Failed to Connect to Server

If you\'re getting a \'Failed to Connect to Server\' issue, some possible solutions are:

-   Check that your network connection is enabled and that no programs are blocking outgoing connections.
-   Try disabling any existing firewall program or changing its configuration options.
-   Restart your modem/router.
-   You may also want to try logging out of your account and then logging back in, as this refreshes your profile\'s authentication and connection with our servers.
-   Restart your device.
-   If you\'re on a wired connection, try connecting with a wireless connection or vice versa.
-   Try connecting with another network connection if possible.
-   If you\'re using a VPN, try turning it off.
-   Check to see if the server is down using downdetector.com.

It is also possible that this can occur when the Mojang servers have difficulties processing requests. If you have tried the above solutions, please wait a bit and try your server login again later.

If issues continue, please get in touch with your network and/or server administrator.

If you\'re still receiving a connection error after trying the above solutions, then you may want to check that this is not caused by some [third-party](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409227755661-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Account-Security-FAQ) Minecraft software/mods that you have downloaded.
