## What is Java Quick Play?

Java Quick Play is an experimental feature for Minecraft: Java Edition in the Minecraft Launcher.

This feature allows you to jump into your five most recently played Java Edition worlds from the Launcher, rather than having you launch the game and then enter a world.

## How do I Use Quick Play?

Quick Play is currently an experimental feature. Follow these steps to use it:

1.  To enable Quick Play, click on the ‘Settings’ option in the lower left corner of the Launcher to open up additional options. ![blobid0.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/18623062738829)
2.  On the Settings page, scroll down to the ‘Experimental Features’ section, and toggle the ‘Enable Experimental Quick Play Feature’ option. ![quick play experimental features.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/18623223563661)
3.  Once enabled, navigate to the Minecraft: Java Edition section of the Launcher. A new ‘Quick Play’ bar will now be visible in the Launcher’s upper right corner.
4.  Within that bar, select ‘Quick Play’ to expand the bar.
5.  Your five most recently played Java Edition worlds will appear in a list. Click one to jump directly into that world from the Launcher!

We want to hear your feedback as we continue to fine-tune the Quick Play feature, so please add your comments and thoughts to our [Feedback post](https://aka.ms/MCQuickPlayFeedback).  

## How do I add a world to the Quick Play Bar?

The Quick Play bar lists your five most recently played Java Edition worlds. To make a world appear in the list, simply play on it. You can also pin a world to the Quick Play list so it remains there even after playing other worlds.

## How do I remove worlds from the Quick Play Bar?

There is currently only room for five worlds in the Quick Play bar. If you’d like to remove a world from the Quick Play bar, play enough other worlds to push the unwanted world out of the list.

## Can I use Quick Play with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition?

No. Quick Play is currently only available for Java Edition.

## What versions of Minecraft: Java Edition support Quick Play?  

Quick Play is available in Java Edition 1.20 or later. Previous versions of Java Edition do not have Quick Play support.

## Does Quick Play support all world types?

You can join single-player worlds, servers, and Realms through Quick Play.

## Where is Quick Play data stored?

Minecraft stores your Quick Play data in your device’s ‘.minecraft’ folder. Quick Play lists are not stored on the cloud and will not carry over multiple devices.
