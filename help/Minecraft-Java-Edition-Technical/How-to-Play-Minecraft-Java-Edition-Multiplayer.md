*This article applies to Minecraft: Java Edition Multiplayer options only. For information on multiplayer options for Bedrock Minecraft versions, see: **[How to Play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Multiplayer.](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/How-to-Play-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Multiplayer.md)***

When playing Minecraft, you can play a single-player or multiplayer game. If you'd like to play with other people, this article outlines the different ways to play multiplayer.

## Ensure Minecraft: Java Edition is on the Correct Version 

When playing Minecraft: Java Edition, a player's game version must be the same as the server version to play on that server, whether it's LAN or hosted online. You can see your game version number at the bottom of your main menu. 

For more information, see [Change Game Versions.](./Change-Game-Version-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md)

## Playing on a Local Area Network (LAN) 

This requires opening your home or local area network (LAN) to others who are also connected to that network. Here is how to connect for Minecraft: Java Edition.

1.  Choose a host computer. This computer should be fast enough to play Minecraft, while running a server for other players as well.
2.  Launch the game and click **Single Player**.
3.  Create a new world or open an existing one. 
4.  Inside that world, press the Esc key, and click **Open to LAN**. 
5.  Choose a game mode to set for the other players.  
    **Tip:** Survival is the default Minecraft mode, including life points and hunger. Creative mode allows you to fly and place an infinite number of blocks. Adventure mode is like Survival mode, but players cannot place or destroy blocks. You can also choose whether to turn cheats (commands) off or on.
6.  Click **Start LAN World**, and you'll see a message that a local game has been hosted. Other players on the same network who wish to join can now start their game, select **Multiplayer**, and their computers should automatically detect the game. 

## Playing on an Online Server 

This requires locating and connecting to the IP address of a multiplayer server. Minecraft Java: Edition does not require an Xbox Live subscription.

A multiplayer server allows two or more players to play Minecraft together. You can either download the server file needed to set up your own server from [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/download/server) or connect to another person’s server.

Follow these steps to connect to another player’s server: 

1.  Log into **Minecraft** and click **Multiplayer** on the main menu,  
2.  Click **Add Server** and enter the IP or web address of the server.    
    **Tip:** If you don't know the IP of a server, thousands of public servers can be located by doing a web search for something that suits your style of play.
