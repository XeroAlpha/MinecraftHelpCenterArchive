When playing Minecraft, you can play a single-player or multiplayer game. If you'd like to play with other people. This article outlines the different ways to play multiplayer and provides some troubleshooting steps if you have difficulty playing multiplayer games. 

## Do I have the right version? 

When playing Minecraft: Java Edition, a player's game version must be the same as the server version to play on that server, whether it's LAN or hosted online. You can see your game version number at the bottom of your main menu. 

For more information, see [Change Game Versions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-) 

For Minecraft on all other platforms, Minecraft can be updated by going to your device’s store. 

## Playing on a Local Area Network (LAN) 

This requires opening your home or local area network (LAN) to others who are also connected to that network. Here is how to connect for Minecraft: Java Edition.

1.  Choose a host computer. This computer should be fast enough to play Minecraft, while running a server for other players as well.
2.  Launch the game and click **Single Player**.
3.  Create a new world or open an existing one. 
4.  Inside that world, press the Esc key, and click **Open to LAN**. 
5.  Choose a game mode to set for the other players.  
    **Tip:** Survival is the default Minecraft mode, including life points and hunger. Creative mode allows you to fly and place an infinite number of blocks. Adventure mode is like Survival mode, but players cannot place or destroy blocks. You can also choose whether to turn cheats (commands) off or on.
6.  Click **Start LAN World**, and you'll see a message that a local game has been hosted. Other players on the same network who wish to join can now start their game, select **Multiplayer**, and their computers should automatically detect the game. 

## Playing on an Online Server 

This requires locating and connecting to the IP address of a multiplayer server. Additionally, Minecraft Java: Edition does not require an Xbox Live subscription.

A multiplayer server allows two or more players to play Minecraft together. You can either download the server file needed to set up your own server from [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/download/server) or connect to another person’s server. **Note:** To access a server you need to run the same version of Minecraft as the server. For more information, see [Changing game version](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-). 

### Connect to another player’s server: 

1.  Log into **Minecraft** and click **Multiplayer** on the main menu,  
2.  Click **Add Server** and enter the IP or web address of the server.    
    **Tip:** If you don't know the IP of a server, thousands of public servers can be located by doing a web search for something that suits your style of play. 

##   Troubleshooting Multiplayer Connection Issues

- Close Minecraft: Java Edition and reopen it.
- Restart your computer or device and see if this fixes the issue. Restarting can often clear errors in connections.
- Log out of your Microsoft or Mojang account, close the game, and then log in again.
- If you are using a wireless connection, ensure that you have a stable connection to your router. You may need to reset or restart your router.
- Check your currently running programs for anything that is using your Internet bandwidth and close those programs.
- If you have a firewall, antivirus software, or are using a VPN, check the settings to be sure that it is not blocking or slowing your connection.
- Configure your router to use moderate or open Network Address Translation (NAT).
- If you’re on a stationary device, try connecting using an Ethernet cable instead of using Wi-Fi.
- Try reverting to a previous save of your world.
- Switch the world slot and open a new world.

## Didn’t Find the Answer?

The troubleshooters above are general but work on most issues. If you have other technical issues, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support) and briefly describe the issue, and don't forget to include your Minecraft Java profile name.
