**Important:** The information on this page is about a feature currently under development.

**What’s changing with the new update?**

The Caves & Cliffs: Part II update brings a lot of exciting changes to the Minecraft overworld,   
including increased height and depths. New worlds will automatically be generated with these new limits. Meanwhile, your existing worlds will be updated to have increased height and depth.  

**How does this impact my existing worlds?**

The update will add more vertical space to your existing worlds in two places:

- Above the highest regions of the overworld
- Under the deepest regions of the overworld

This means that there’s a lot more world to explore! You can build higher, allowing for even larger builds that push the limits of your imagination.

You can also dig deeper, which could lead you to the new, beautiful lush caves that we’re introducing in this update.

**How do I update my world?**

When you’ve updated to the latest Minecraft beta, you can update your existing world to the new height and depth limits by turning on the “Caves and Cliffs” experimental toggle. Here’s a [guide on](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402614714509-Caves-Cliffs-Experimental-Features-Toggle-for-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition)   
[how to do it](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402614714509-Caves-Cliffs-Experimental-Features-Toggle-for-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition).

When you’ve enabled the toggle, we’re adding more vertical space under the deepest regions of  
your world. This added space is automatically filled with blocks and caves for you to explore.

We’ll use the improved cave generation that will be introduced in Minecraft 1.18, which means you could find new cave shapes, sizes, and biomes.
