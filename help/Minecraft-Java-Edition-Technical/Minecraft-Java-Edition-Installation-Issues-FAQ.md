*This article addresses installation and update issues for Minecraft: Java Edition. If you need assistance with Bedrock versions of Minecraft installation issues, See the [Minecraft Installation Issues FAQ](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Installation-Issues-FAQ.md). *

## What are the Device Requirements to Run Minecraft: Java Edition?

A stable internet connection is required for Minecraft to download game files, authenticate Java profile names, and connect to multiplayer servers. 

Minecraft will not run on Windows RT tablets or a toaster (despite some actually using Java), or your car (feel free to prove us wrong, though).

A computer with the minimum requirements should enable gameplay for Minecraft: Java Edition. However, for the best experience, provide the recommended requirements.  

**Note: If you are unsure of whether or not your computer is powerful enough to run Minecraft, it is highly recommended that you try Minecraft in [demo mode](./Minecraft-Java-Edition-Demo-Mode.md) before purchase. **

For current minimum and recommended system requirement information, you can visit the [Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition purchase page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc#accordionv1-b6c8df09da-item-7739893325).

For desktop and laptops, you can run either version Java or Windows 10 (and above). Minecraft for Windows can be installed from the Microsoft Store. Minecraft: Java Edition can be installed from [our website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/). 

### Software Requirements 

- Minecraft Release 1.6 or newer. Older versions will need to be updated to current versions.
- Note that some users experience issues playing Minecraft while using a mismatched version of Java for their operating system (32 or 64 bit), while using certain versions of Java 7, or while multiple versions of Java are installed.
- Java 8 is required to run Minecraft versions 1.12 through 1.17. Java 17 is required to run Minecraft version 1.18 and up. If you don't know whether you have the necessary version of Java, don't worry, our installers supply Minecraft with its own version of Java by default.

## How do I install Minecraft: Java Edition? 

To install the game, go to the [Minecraft download](https://www.minecraft.net/download) page and download the game client. You can download the game client even if you don't own the game, but you will only be able to play the [Minecraft Demo Mode](./Minecraft-Java-Edition-Demo-Mode.md). After downloading the client, double-click the shortcut icon to run it. 

**Note: Minecraft purchases are tied to your Microsoft account and not a device. As such, you can download and install Minecraft: Java Edition on as many computers as you want. **

To log in, use your Microsoft account email address and password.  Please make sure that you are connected to the internet, because the game will automatically download additional files the first time. After you install Minecraft and store your account credentials, it's possible to play either with or without an internet connection. 

Firewalls and antivirus programs can sometimes cause trouble during installation. If you're having trouble installing Minecraft, you may want to allow Minecraft through your firewall or antivirus software and try again. 

If you experience issues downloading or running Minecraft: Java Edition, please visit our [Minecraft: Java Edition Troubleshooting](./Minecraft-Java-Edition-Troubleshooting.md) page. 

## How to Manually Update Minecraft: Java Edition

To play the newest content in Minecraft: Java Edition, your game needs to be updated to the most recent version. This should happen automatically while your device is in standby mode or in use while connected to an active Internet connection. However, if you need to manually update your game, you’ll find the instructions for your Java Edition version listed below.  

### How do I find my current version number? 

Find the version number on the bottom left of the Java Edition home screen, on the top left of the Java Edition play window, or to the left of the **Play** button in the Launcher. 

### Minecraft: Java Edition (PC/Mac/Linux) 

Open the Minecraft launcher. The launcher should automatically show you the latest release. If not, click the arrow to the right of the **Play **button and select **Latest Release**. 

Don’t see the launcher? [Download it](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download). 

## Minecraft Launcher 

The Minecraft Launcher supports Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and all other Minecraft games in one place. We hope the following answers will help you with questions you may have about these changes. 

### What is the Minecraft Launcher? 

In December 2020 we created a single Minecraft Launcher from which players can launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, Minecraft: Java Edition, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Legends. The banner you’re seeing at the bottom of your game directs you to the link where you can install this launcher. Moving to the launcher is required and centralizes your launchers for Minecraft games. 

### Do I have to upgrade to this launcher? 

As of January 18, 2021, this launcher is required to access Minecraft Dungeons. The old launcher will let you know that you need to upgrade. 

### How do I switch between my accounts to play my games? 

If you own Minecraft: Java Edition on one Microsoft account and Minecraft Dungeons on a different account, you can link both accounts to the Minecraft Launcher. You will need to switch between those accounts to access the games.

From the main launcher screen, select your profile in the top-left portion of the screen, and then select **View all accounts**.** **From there, select the **Switch Account** button under your currently logged in Microsoft account.

### Is the launcher also available on Mac and Linux? 

While the updated launcher is available for players on Mac and Linux, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Legends are unfortunately not playable on these devices.

### My game installation is stalling or stopping part of the way through

You can try uninstalling and reinstalling the game or even the Launcher. If that doesn’t work, you can try resetting the Microsoft Store using the following steps:   

1.  Press the Windows key + R simultaneously  
2.  A window will appear. Type in WSReset and hit enter  

You can also try repairing and resetting the Launcher using the following steps:   

1.  Go to the Start Menu
2.  Right click on the Minecraft Launcher
3.  Select **More**
4.  Open **App Settings**
5.  Within these settings, click on ****Repair**** and ****Reset****

### I don’t want to install on my C Drive. How do I install Minecraft on a different drive on my PC?

You will need to set up the other drive to allow Minecraft to be installed on them. Go into your PC settings - go to **Settings**\>**System**\>**Storage**\>**Change where new content is saved**. In that menu, go to the **New apps will save to dropdown** and select the drive you'd like to install Minecraft on.  
Once you select the other drive in that setting, the option to install to the new drive (or another drive) will become available in the Minecraft Launcher.****  
****

## Transferring Minecraft: Java Edition to Another Computer 

Please be cautious with moving or modifying your save files. We advise that you make a backup before you perform any actions in this folder. You can back up your files by copying them and storing them in another folder or on a USB drive. 

Start by finding [your saves folder](./Managing-Data-and-Game-Storage-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md#where-are-minecraft-files-stored). You can find all Minecraft folders, including the saves folder, by going into the game launcher:

1.  Open the Minecraft launcher and log in.
2.  Select **Launch options**, and then select the launcher configuration you are running (the default is **Latest release**). 
3.  Locate the **Game directory **selection and select the little green arrow to the right of it. A new window will open containing your Minecraft folder. When you open the saves folder you will see all your saved worlds in different folders. 
4.  Place the world folder(s) that you want to transfer onto a portable storage device, file sharing software, or cloud computing service.
5.  After the files are ready to be transferred, place them in the new computer's saves folder and they will be available in your list of single player worlds.

## Uninstall Minecraft

We're sorry to see you go, but we understand that sometimes you need to uninstall the game. We hope it’s to install a different version or to install on a different platform! Here's what you need to know to uninstall Minecraft. 

Please note that your worlds and your saved worlds and inventory will be deleted when you remove the files. To keep your progress, locate the saves folder and save it on your computer before you drag the .minecraft folder to the trash. You can find the saves folder in the .minecraft folder. For more information about where your saves files are stored, please go to [Where Are Minecraft Files Stored?](./Managing-Data-and-Game-Storage-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md#where-are-minecraft-files-stored) 

### Windows 

1.  Go to your Application Data Folder, %AppData%. To find it, press Win+R, type **%appdata%\\minecraft**, and then click **OK**. 
2.  Drag the .minecraft folder to the trash. 

### macOS 

1.  Select the Finder icon in the Dock and open a Finder window. 
2.  Press Shift+Command+G to open the Go to Folder dialog and type **~/Library/Application Support/**. 
3.  Drag the minecraft folder to the trash. 

### Linux 

1.  Open a terminal. 
2.  Enter this command: **rm -vr ~/.minecraft/\***.
