## What is a Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshot?

Snapshots are in-development versions of Minecraft: Java Edition that players can try out before its release. They contain various features that are in testing prior to a potential future release, although these features are not finished and do not contain the entirety of the next update.

As long as you can play Minecraft: Java Edition, you can give the latest Snapshot a try.

2.  Choose the versions you want to see in your directory as well as which version you want to play.
3.  If you select ‘New installation’, you can also choose to download a previous Snapshot for the most recent update.
