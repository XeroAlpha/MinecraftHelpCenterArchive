## What is the Minecraft Marketplace?

Minecraft Marketplace is a way to find and purchase curated, community-made content from within Minecraft Legends. You purchase content from Marketplace using a currency called Minecoins (or Tokens, for PlayStation® users), which you can purchase in Marketplace.

You can discover and purchase new avatar skins, textures, and mini-games made by creators in the Minecraft community directly in-game. With Minecraft Marketplace, we've made it safer and easier to purchase community-made content for Minecraft Legends.

Available for purchase in the game store, Minecoins let you buy content from creators on Minecraft Marketplace, which is curated to ensure quality and refreshed on a monthly basis. Minecoins are kept in your virtual wallet and can be used across devices when you’re signed into Xbox Live.

**Note: With your free Xbox Live player profile, each purchase you make is also tied to your account. Your purchased content does not expire, it’s yours to keep.**

## Which devices is Minecraft Marketplace available on?

Minecraft Marketplace is available on any device running Minecraft Legends.

### Supported Systems and Devices

- Nintendo Switch
- PlayStation 4
- PlayStation 5
- Windows 10 and above
- Xbox One
- Xbox Series X\|S
- Steam

Minecraft Marketplace content purchased in Minecraft Legends will transfer between platforms when logged in with the same Microsoft account.

## Do I need an Xbox Live account to make purchases in Minecraft Marketplace?

Yes, you need an Xbox Live account to make purchases in Minecraft Marketplace. That way, you can use Minecoins and content you buy across other devices, when you’re logged in. If you don’t have an account, you can create one by going to ‌<https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/minecraft/sign-up> and creating a new free account.

## How do I know what account to use for Minecraft Legends?

When logged in to Minecraft Legends, you will see your Gamertag on the title screen and at the top of Marketplace.

## How do I purchase Minecoins?

To purchase Minecoins, you must have a payment method set up in your device. The first time you try to purchase something, you’ll be asked to add a payment method if you haven’t already. Otherwise, when you sign in to make your purchase, you’ll be reminded which payment method you have saved.

Your payment method may vary depending on which device you’re using to make a purchase. In all cases, by signing in with your Xbox Live account, you can access your Minecoins on any Minecraft Legends device.

**Note**: **If you’re a parent with associated child accounts that share your Xbox subscription, make sure that you make purchases with your own account, as child accounts do not provide a payment method for this. If your child has their own Xbox account that you have provided consent for and you want to purchase marketplace content for them, it will need to be purchased through their Xbox/Minecraft account.**

Prepaid cards to redeem for Minecoins may also be available from local retail stores.

## What can I spend Minecoins on?

You can purchase all Minecraft Legends in-game content and add-ons using Minecoins, including skins and mini-games.

## Will my Minecoins or Tokens from Minecraft Carry Over?

Yes. Any Minecoins or Tokens in your Minecraft Marketplace account will carry over to Minecraft Legends.

**Note: While your currencies from Minecraft will carry over to Minecraft Legends, no Marketplace content from Minecraft will carry over to Minecraft Legends. This includes skins, texture packs, and more.**

## Will my Existing Marketplace Content (skins, textures, etc.) Carry Over to Minecraft Legends?

No. Your existing Minecraft Marketplace content will not carry over to Minecraft Legends. Content in Minecraft Legends is designed to work exclusively with Minecraft Legends, just like content in Minecraft is designed to work exclusively with Minecraft.

## I didn’t receive the Minecoins that I purchased. What should I do?

If you purchased on your Windows 10 (and above) device:

- Sign in at [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com/) and check your recent purchases.
- If you see a completed purchase, restart your device as it may need to be updated.
- If you have another device running Minecraft, sign in on that device to see if your purchase appears there.
- If the purchase appears, there may be a problem on your device. Make sure that you’re signed in with the same account used to complete the purchase.
  - If the purchase doesn’t appear, contact [Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us).
  - Additional Support:
  - Microsoft Store - [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/) 
  - Xbox One/Xbox Series consoles - [Xbox Support](http://support.xbox.com/contact-us) 
  - PlayStation™ – [PlayStation™ Store](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/store/ps-store-refund-request/)
  - Nintendo – [Nintendo Support](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/contact)
  - Steam – [Steam Support](https://help.steampowered.com/en/)

## Can Minecoins be refunded?

All Minecoin purchases are final. However, if an unauthorized purchase was made by someone else, contact store support for the device that made the purchase.

## Can I convert my Minecoins back to real currency?

No. Once you've purchased Minecoins, they can’t be converted back to real currency.

## Can I give Minecoins to someone as a Gift?

Minecoins are available only on the account where they were purchased. They cannot be given from one Xbox Live account to another. However, Minecoin gift cards are available at many retail outlets. You’re always welcome to purchase one of these and give it to a friend.

## I tried to use Minecoins to make an in-game purchase, but something went wrong. What should I do?

The most common problem preventing an in-game purchase is that there aren’t enough coins. Check the top-right corner of Microsoft Store to make sure you have enough coins to make the purchase. If not, you can click the + icon to purchase more.

If you tried to purchase more coins but you don’t see them in your wallet, follow the steps in the previous section titled [I didn't receive the coins that I purchased. What do I do?](../Minecraft-Marketplace/How-to-Get-Help-With-Missing-Minecoins-in-Minecraft-Marketplace.md#h_01FF8TBWEZRCYSC42KE1TTX3X2)

## I purchased the wrong content by mistake. Can I get a refund?

You’ll need to contact store support for the device that you made your purchase on. You may get a refund depending on the circumstances. Follow the steps in the previous section titled [Can Minecoins be refunded?](https://support.xbox.com/games/game-titles/minecraft-marketplace-faq#Refund) for support.

## Where are my purchases stored?

If you have an Xbox Live account associated with your game and you were logged in at the time of purchase, your coins and content will be associated with your Xbox Live account. You can access these from any new device, provided you are logged in to the same account. For help with missing purchases, or any Xbox Live account support, please contact [Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/contact-us).

If you do not have an Xbox Live account associated with your game, then your Marketplace purchases will be tied to the device you used for the purchase. Please be aware, uninstalling the game will permanently delete any purchased coins and content purchased this way. For further billing and installation support, contact your device's app store.

**Note: To access your purchases from other devices, we recommend that you link them to an Xbox Live account by signing in from the device used for the purchase.**

## I redeemed a content code but can’t find my content, where should I look?

Open the in-game Marketplace and click the button next to your account name to see your inventory. Your content will be listed. Click the icon for the content you want and download the piece of content onto your device.

## I can’t redeem my code, what should I do?

See the troubleshooting section of [Redeem a gift card or code to your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/redeem-a-gift-card-or-code-to-your-microsoft-account-d6b2c675-9e31-f312-7ff4-21834ad22fa8).

## I have missing Marketplace items; where can I find them?

When you can’t find an item after purchasing from a digital store, start by making sure you are logged in to the correct account where you want these items to appear. 

In many cases, this happens when parents purchase these items or redeem a gift card on their own Microsoft account and don’t realize that they cannot be transferred to a child’s account later. 

If you find that you have redeemed a prepaid card or purchased on the wrong account, you must contact [Xbox support. ](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us) 

For other issues, try these steps to troubleshoot.

- Make sure your game is completely up to date.  
- Make sure you are signed in with the Microsoft account you used to make the purchases. 
- Completely close Minecraft Legends. 
- Make sure you are connected to a reliable internet connection.  
- Launch Minecraft Legends and make sure you are signed in and you are the only user playing Minecraft Legends at this time.  
- Let the game load up to the home screen and wait for 15 – 60 seconds (if on Nintendo Switch loading can take up to 120 seconds). This ensures the game has time to completely load. 
- If this has not solved the issue, please try steps 2-6 again. 

If you are still unable to find your missing Marketplace items, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). 

## I noticed a problem with something I purchased in the Marketplace. How do I let you know?

If you find something broken or otherwise bothersome in an item you purchased in the Marketplace, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).

## How do I become a Minecraft Marketplace Partner and create content for Minecraft Legends?

If you're interested in becoming a partner, and to learn more about the criteria required, visit the [Minecraft Partner Program](https://creator.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft) page for more info.

## I have more questions!
