*The Minecraft Marketplace is an in-game store for community-made and official creations that include skin and texture packs for your heroes and mounts, Lost Legends, and Myths. You can purchase these downloadable content (DLC) creations using Minecoins, which can be bought within the Minecraft Legends marketplace or the game store. Not all community-made content requires Minecoins; some packs and worlds can be downloaded for free.*

## Purchasing Minecoins

**Note: Any Minecoin purchases you make are tied to your Microsoft account and the payment method you have tied to it.**

If you'd like to purchase Minecoins, start by clicking the Minecoin icon on the top right of the Marketplace screen. 

From there, you'll see a list of Minecoin amounts and their purchase price.

Select the amount you'd like to buy. You'll be prompted to enter your Microsoft Account password or PIN. Once entered, you'll be taken to the purchase confirmation screen. Click 'Buy' to complete the purchase.

If you see this screen, you've followed all of the steps correctly and a confirmation screen will appear shortly afterward. From there, the Minecoins should appear in your inventory.

## Navigating the Marketplace

Upon entering the Marketplace, you will see the skins & textures available alongside their prices. You are also able to browse the Lost Legends and Myths available via the tabs up top. On the top right you can see your Inventory and current number of Minecoins. You can also buy more Minecoins by clicking on the Minecoin icon.

Select a Marketplace item to view its description, its item type, and some preview images.

To buy a Marketplace item with Minecoins, select the ‘Buy’ button. Another pop-up will appear, informing you of the item’s cost and how many Minecoins you’ll have left after purchasing. Click ‘Purchase Item’ to confirm your purchase.

## Downloading Content

Once you’ve purchased an item, you can navigate to it and select the ‘Download DLC’ button to download it. When the item is downloaded, a button will appear that takes you to where you can view it. You can also view and re-download all of your purchased items via the ‘Inventory’ screen on the top right.

## Equipping Heroes and Mount Skins

You can equip heroes and mount skins via the ‘Switch Hero’ button on the game’s main menu. Here, you will see a list of your downloaded Heroes, as well as mount skins for each available mount in the game.

To activate a hero or mount, simply select it in the list and hit ‘Confirm.’ Your currently active skin or mount will have a green checkbox next to it.
