If you are just starting out a new world on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for the first time, let us start by saying welcome! We are glad to have you give Minecraft a try. We hope you enjoy the game and are able to have all kinds of fun and adventure either on your own or with friends.

Before you jump into that world, it will be beneficial to you to understand what you have access to on the menu. If you are feeling a little overwhelmed and not really sure where to start, here is a beginner's guide that will hopefully give you the head start you need. For more, you can also check out this [Tips for Beginners page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/minecraft-tips-for-beginners).

## Play

Obviously, you came to Minecraft to actually play the game! To get started, select the Play button on the menu and you will be met with your world list. At first, this will be empty, but we can fill this up with exciting worlds in no time! If you are looking to [join a friend's world or Realm](../Create-or-Join-Realms/How-to-Join-a-Friend-s-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md), head over to the Friends tab where your friends should pop up or you can enter a code to join a Realm.

To make your own world, select **Create New** at the top of your world list. First, you will be given a page that shows off some exciting Realms Plus and Marketplace templates, but for your first time, you probably just want a normal world, so let's select Create New World at the top.

Now that we are in world creation, start by thinking of a super fun and unique name for your world. If that doesn't work, you can just leave it as the default "My World."

Below that, choose between playing in a [Survival or Creative world](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/creative-vs-survival-mode). Survival is the base Minecraft experience that will have you working to gather resources and encountering hostile mobs. To learn more, see [All Game Modes in Minecraft](./All-Game-Modes-in-Minecraft.md).

Difficulty can be changed later on as well, so don't feel too stressed to make a final decision here. For your first time playing, Easy should be a great way to introduce yourself to the game while encountering hostile mobs like the explosive Creeper and managing your hunger. If you don't want that stress in your life, Peaceful will turn off hostile mobs and your hunger will not deplete.

When you are ready, click Create to start your Minecraft experience! You can also venture into the Advanced and other settings sections to further tweak your world.

## Dressing Room

Our lovable Steve is the default starting skin, but you have so many choices for how you look in the game! Either in the game's pause menu or the starting screen, you can change how you look by selecting Dressing Room.

On this page, you can create and [customize Minecraft skins](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/what-is-minecraft-skin) or select a pre-made skin in the Classic Skins tab. If you have purchased some Minecoins for the Marketplace, you can also equip skins made by other creators. Whether you want to make something unique or want to rep your favorite character from another property, be sure to explore your options!

## Find Friends

Play with your friends in their Minecraft world, or invite them to your own! See [How Do I Join a Friend’s Online World in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition?](../Multiplayer-Support/How-to-Join-a-Friend-s-Online-World-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md)

## Marketplace 

The Marketplace is your one-stop shop to get access to all kinds of new content in Minecraft! You can look through and find all kinds of interesting worlds, skin packs, textures, and more all made by Minecraft creators and featuring some of your favorite franchises! [The Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/what-minecraft-marketplace) is constantly getting new content, so be sure to check back to see what is in the store.
