We want you to be as comfortable as possible while playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, so we’ve made loads of clever tweaks to bring the game to VR!

## Launching Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in VR

If you are unable to launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition from your VR headset's game library, you may need to set up a custom shortcut on your desktop to launch Minecraft in VR.

### Setting up a Custom Shortcut: 

1.  To set up a custom shortcut right click your desktop, under ‘new’ create a new shortcut 
2.  For the location of the item, enter the following: minecraft://Mode/?OpenXR=true 
3.  Click ‘Next’ and give your shortcut a name like “Minecraft VR” 
4.  You should see the shortcut created on your desktop and it should automatically have the Minecraft icon if set up correctly 
5.  Click ‘Finish’ and your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition VR shortcut has been created! 

To use this shortcut, make sure your VR headset is plugged into your computer and powered on. Clicking the shortcut you just made will launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in your VR headset instead of on your computer.

## Enhanced Options for VR

When playing the game for the first time you will be asked to select a preferred control scheme: 

### VR Controls (recommended) or the Classic control scheme

You can also toggle individual features in the Options Menu. You can reach this through the Pause screen by pressing the Menu button (gamepad). 

### Virtual Living Room 

When entering the game, the player is placed in a static environment we have dubbed the Living Room. The viewpoint is still VR and the player can look around the room but the gameplay is fixed on the virtual screen in front of them. The player can play the game entirely in this mode with access to all features, or toggle the Immersive Mode, by pressing the change view button – this pulls the player into the virtual screen as the world envelops them in the completely 360-degree, rendered point of view. 

Based on your VR headset, this button layout may be different. Check your Living Room HUD to make sure you know which to press. 

### Options: VR Menu 

The player’s gameplay and interaction with the VR world is primarily controlled through a dedicated set of options that are presented to the player in a new VR Options menu that is accessed through the Menu button on the gamepad. Our recommended defaults are marked in **bold** below. 

### VR Controls 

- \[**ON**\] VR Controls (In Progress). All VR Options default to ON if these controls are selected. 
- \[OFF\] Classic Controls. Options for VR Head Steering, Linear Jump, VR Turning and VR Turning Sound are ignored. 

### Show Control Selection Screen 

At startup, the player is shown a UI screen where they have to pick the VR control selection.  Turning this option off stops displaying this screen and the last selected control option is saved. Players can turn this option back on which starts displaying the screen again. 

### VR Turning 

This is only available in Immersive Mode. 

- \[**ON**\] Turing is done in segments (default for VR Controls (In Progress)). 

<!-- -->

- \[OFF\] Classic Controls turning is turned on. Note that VR Turn by Time setting is ignored. 

### VR Turn by Time 

This is only available in Immersive Mode. 

- \[**ON**\] VR Turn has the same number of turns per second, but the angles are different based on how far the Right Stick is pushed. 
- \[OFF\] VR Turn occurs with a constant angle. 

### VR Turning Sound 

This is only available in Immersive Mode. 

- \[**ON**\] A distinctive sound plays every time the player turns. 
- \[OFF\] No sound plays when turning. 

### Head Steering 

- \[**ON**\] The direction of motion of the character follows the player’s POV (gaze direction). 
- \[OFF\] If the character is moving, direction of motion is independent of POV. The character turns in relation to POV only if they are stationary. 

### 3D Rendering 

- \[**ON**\] This option turns on stereoscopic rendering when in Immersive Mode and slightly lowers the draw distance to try to maintain a steady frame rate. 
- \[OFF\] The world will render as monoscopic and the frame rate is higher, since only one frame is rendered to both eyes. 

### Linear Jump 

- \[**ON**\] The Jump is a 2-stage linear jump, which removes the variable velocity and acceleration/deceleration from the jump. It also jumps the same height as a block instead of slightly higher. 
- \[OFF\] The game uses the Classic Controls jumping HUD Drift 

### HUD Drift 

- \[**ON**\] HUD is allowed to “float” for comfort. 

<!-- -->

- \[OFF\] HUD is fixed in position to player’s POV. 

### Linear Motion 

When turned on, the player’s velocity is constant with all acceleration/deceleration disabled. 

### Sticky Mining 

- \[**ON**\] Causes the cursor to remain locked on the currently mined block until the block is destroyed. If the player POV moves to another block, a second cursor (a small, hovering white dot) appears to guide the player and highlight which block will be targeted next.
- \[OFF\] The cursor moves freely as the player shifts their POV while mining. It is possible to interrupt mining if the player’s gaze shifts off the current block. 

### Options: Controls 

#### VR Sensitivity 

This control function is altered when playing in Immersive Mode. It affects the turn speed of both Classic Mode (Sensitivity) and VR Turning controls. 

#### VR Auto-Jump 

This control function is altered when playing in Immersive Mode. It turns this behavior on and off in VR, but doesn’t affect the Classic Mode Auto-Jump. 

### Options: Graphics 

#### VR Brightness 

This adjusts the brightness of the game in both VR Modes (Immersive and Living Room). 

#### VR Render Distance 

This adjusts the Render Distance of the game in both VR Modes (Immersive and Living Room). Setting this too high may reduce frame rate and cause discomfort. 

#### Texel Anti-Aliasing 

This option is not supported on Note 4 and is therefore hidden. 

- \[**ON**\] Anti-aliasing of block textures is enabled for improved visual quality. Frame rate will be reduced. 
- \[OFF\] Anti-aliasing of block textures is disabled.
