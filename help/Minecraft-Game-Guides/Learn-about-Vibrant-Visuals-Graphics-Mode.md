[Vibrant Visuals](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/chase-the-skies-and-vibrant-visuals-playable-today) is Minecraft’s official visual refresh on compatible Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices. Download the most recent version of Minecraft to enjoy the feature. Vibrant Visuals is a Graphics Mode in Minecraft Video settings, not an add-on, so you can play on Realms with friends whether they have Vibrant Visuals enabled or not.

## Supported devices and minimum requirements

Here are the supported devices for Vibrant Visuals:

- Xbox Series X\|S, Xbox One
- PlayStation 4/5
- Android devices running on Adreno 640, Mali-G68, Mali-G77, Xclipse 530 or higher
- iOS devices running on A12, M1, or higher
- Windows PCs running Minecraft on DirectX 12

Vibrant Visuals is enabled by default on most gaming devices. If Vibrant Visuals isn’t enabled on your device, see [Manage Vibrant Visuals Graphics Mode Settings](./Manage-Vibrant-Visuals-Graphics-Mode-Settings.md).

## Supported content and options

- **Supported Content**: Vibrant Visuals is compatible with Marketplace Add-Ons, Skins, and Persona items. Vibrant Visuals is automatically turned off if you are using Worlds and Texture Packs that are not compatible.
- **Multiplayer and Cross-Platform Gaming**: You can enjoy Vibrant Visuals playing Worlds via multiplayer or Realms. When playing Splitscreen multiplayer on consoles, Minecraft defaults to Fancy or Simple Graphics Modes.
