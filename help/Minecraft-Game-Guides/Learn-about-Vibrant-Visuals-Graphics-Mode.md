[Vibrant Visuals](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/chase-the-skies-and-vibrant-visuals-playable-today) is Minecraft’s official visual refresh on compatible Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices. Download the most recent version of Minecraft to enjoy the feature. Vibrant Visuals is a Graphics Mode in Minecraft Video settings, not an Add-on, so you can play on Realms with friends whether they have Vibrant Visuals enabled or not.

## Supported devices and minimum requirements

Here are the supported devices for Vibrant Visuals:

- Xbox Series X\|S, Xbox One
- PlayStation 4/5
- Android devices running on Adreno 640, Mali-G68, Mali-G77, Xclipse 530 or higher
- iOS devices running on A12, M1, or higher
- Windows PCs running Minecraft on DirectX 12

**Vibrant Visuals is grayed out and cannot be selected:** Vibrant Visuals is enabled by default on most gaming devices. If Vibrant Visuals is grayed out in your system settings and cannot be selected, this means your system doesn't meet the minimum requirements and Vibrant Visuals was automatically disabled. If you believe that your system meets minimum requirements, update your operating system and graphics drivers to the most recent version. See [Manage Vibrant Visuals Graphics Mode Settings](./Manage-Vibrant-Visuals-Graphics-Mode-Settings.md) and [Troubleshooting Graphics Issues in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting-Graphics-Issues-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) for information.

## Supported content and options

- **Supported Content**: Vibrant Visuals is compatible with Marketplace Add-Ons, skins, and persona items. Vibrant Visuals is automatically turned off if you are using worlds and texture packs that are not compatible.
- **Multiplayer and Cross-Platform Gaming**: You can enjoy Vibrant Visuals playing Worlds via multiplayer or Realms. When playing split-screen multiplayer on consoles, Minecraft defaults to Fancy or Simple Graphics Modes.
