[Vibrant Visuals](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/chase-the-skies-and-vibrant-visuals-playable-today) is Minecraft’s official visual refresh on compatible Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices. Download the most recent version of Minecraft to enjoy the feature. Vibrant Visuals is a Graphics Mode in Minecraft Video settings, not an Add-on, so you can play on Realms with friends whether they have Vibrant Visuals enabled or not. See [Manage Vibrant Visuals Graphics Mode Settings](./Manage-Vibrant-Visuals-Graphics-Mode-Settings.md) for more information.

## Supported devices and minimum requirements

Here are the supported devices for Vibrant Visuals:

- Xbox Series X\|S, Xbox One
- PlayStation 4/5
- Android devices running on Adreno 640, Mali-G68, Mali-G77, Xclipse 530 or higher
- iOS devices running on A12, M1, or higher
- Windows PCs running Minecraft on DirectX 12 (older graphics cards that support DirectX 12 may be incompatible)

### **Vibrant Visuals is grayed out and cannot be selected** 

There are situations where you cannot change your Graphics Mode to Vibrant Visuals:

- **Actively playing a world:** If you are playing a world and want to change your graphics setting, you need to save and exit the game and enter Settings from the launch screen.
- **System incompatible:** If your system doesn't meet the minimum requirements, Vibrant Visuals is automatically disabled. If possible on your system, try updating your operating system and graphics drivers to the most recent version.
- **Conflicting Add-Ons:** If you are using worlds and texture packs that are not compatible, this graphics mode will be disabled.

## Supported content and options

- **Supported Content**: Vibrant Visuals is compatible with Marketplace Add-Ons, skins, and persona items. Vibrant Visuals is automatically turned off if you are using worlds and texture packs that are not compatible.
- **Multiplayer and Cross-Platform Gaming**: You can enjoy Vibrant Visuals playing Worlds via multiplayer or Realms. When playing split-screen multiplayer on consoles, Minecraft defaults to Fancy or Simple Graphics Modes.
