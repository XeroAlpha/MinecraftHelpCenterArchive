The way you play in Minecraft is entirely decided by you. Whether you want the traditional experience or want to do something a little different, here are all of the playable game modes in Minecraft.

## Survival

Survival is the traditional Minecraft experience. Collect resources and build structures while surviving in a generated world. At night, hostile mobs like zombies and skeletons will attack, so make sure you are prepared!

## Hardcore

This is a one life mode. If you die, you will lose access to playing in the world forever, though you can fly around in spectator mode. Once turned on, it cannot be turned off on a world, so be sure you are committed to this challenge! Only for the most skilled and dedicated survivalist!

## Creative

In Creative Mode, you can build to your heart’s content! You can fly around and place unlimited blocks without the fear of health, hunger, or resources. All blocks are instantly destroyed when you punch them as well. If you have an idea for a build project, you can get it done instantly here!

## Adventure

Adventure Mode lets creators craft a unique experience for guests to their world. Incoming players won’t be able to break or place blocks unless they hold special items that allow them to. These worlds are made entirely to be a player-created adventure.

## Spectator

As you might expect from its name, Spectator Mode lets you watch over a world without having any interaction with it. You can fly through blocks but won’t be able to physically alter anything.
