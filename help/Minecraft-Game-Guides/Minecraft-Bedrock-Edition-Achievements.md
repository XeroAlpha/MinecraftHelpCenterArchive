Achievements are optional goals laid out for players who want a bit of direction while playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. You can view completed and suggested Achievements in-game when you [view your profile](../Performance-Troubleshooting/How-to-view-your-Minecraft-Profile.md).

## How can I earn achievements?

Xbox achievements can be earned in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on these systems when connected to the internet:

- Xbox
- PC
- iOS
- Android
- Nintendo Switch

On mobile and Nintendo Switch devices, you must have a Microsoft account linked to the profile playing Minecraft for Xbox achievements to attach to that Microsoft account.

PlayStation users can earn trophies attached to their PSN accounts. While you can connect a Microsoft account to your PlayStation profile to crossplay with friends, Xbox achievements cannot be earned on the PlayStation version of Minecraft. For more information on this topic, please visit the [Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PlayStation FAQ](../Account-Sign-In/How-to-Link-and-Unlink-Microsoft-and-PlayStation-Accounts-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md).

## How to turn achievements on or off in Realms

If your Realm is set to **Creative mode**, achievements will be disabled for your world. Unfortunately, re-activating achievements is only possible if you have a backup from before **Cheats **or **Creative mode** was enabled. If no backups are available, then that world will remain without achievements enabled.
