Starting a new world in Minecraft is an exciting time. You know you have an infinite amount of adventure ahead of you, filled with ores to mine, biomes to see, and various things to build. However, if you are new to the game, your first night can be overwhelming if you are not prepared. Here are some tips to survive the first night in Minecraft.

## Prepare for the night

- Gather resources like food, wood, and wool to build a bed, crafting table, and furnace.
- Find somewhere to make a shelter. Build a little house, dig a hole into the ground and cover yourself, or move into a nearby village.
- Focus on making at least a stone pickaxe and/or sword to give you better digging and fighting capabilities.
- Gather coal and charcoal to make torches. Place the torches in dark areas to prevent hostile mobs from spawning.
