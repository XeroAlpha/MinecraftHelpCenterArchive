Starting a new world in Minecraft is an exciting time. You know you have an infinite amount of adventure ahead of you, filled with ores to mine, biomes to see, and various things to build. However, if you are new to the game, your first night can be overwhelming if you are not prepared. Here are some tips to survive the first night in Minecraft.

## Prepare for the night

- **Collect the Basics:** Harvest wood and cobblestone to build basic tools. Kill animals to collect other essentials like food and wool.

- **Build Necessities:** Build a bed to sleep through the night and have a spawning base if you die. Build a crafting table and furnace to make tools and cook food using the wood and minerals you collect.

- **Craft Basic Tools:** Focus on making at least a stone pickaxe and/or sword to give you better digging and fighting capabilities.

- **Create or Find Shelter:** Find somewhere you can be safe from mobs when the sun goes down. Build a little house, dig a hole in the ground and cover yourself, or move into a nearby village.

- **Build Defenses:** Gather coal and charcoal to make torches. Place the torches in dark areas to prevent hostile mobs from spawning.

Surviving your first night in Minecraft can be a scary thought, but once you are prepared, you will be able to handle just about anything that goes bump in the night. For more help, check out thisâ€¯[Tips for Beginners](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/minecraft-tips-for-beginners) page.
