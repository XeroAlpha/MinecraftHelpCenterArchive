As you explore the different dimensions in Minecraft, you can come across rare structures that have unique items, mobs, and more hidden inside. Here is a list to keep your eye out for.

- **Abandoned mineshaft** – Tunnels that are filled with railways and wooden structures. The only area where cave spider spawners are found.
- **Ancient city** – Found way down in the deep dark biome and always generates at the Y level –51. There are buildings and statue ruins around this area, and you can find some loot chests around.
- **Bastion remnant** – These large castles appear in all Nether biomes except for basalt deltas. Piglins and hoglins are commonly found here and you can come across a magma cube spawner. Be sure to keep your eyes out for treasure as well.
- **Desert pyramid** – These temples have a hidden room below the center of the floor with four chests inside. Be careful when you get down here, though, as the area is trapped!
- **End city** – A tall tower structure found in The End. Shulkers are found here, and so be careful when exploring so you don’t get fall to your death.
- **End ship** – Ship structures that appear in the sky above end cities or near the outer end. You can find an elytra in an item frame near the front of the ship.
- **Fossils** – Bone block structures that appear in desert and swamp biomes. You might find coal or diamond ore inside.
- **Igloo** – A small house made of snow blocks found in snowy biomes. Sometimes, you can find a trapdoor underneath a carpet inside, leading to a basement with a villager and zombie villager inside.
- **Jungle temple** – These buildings have puzzles and traps inside with some nice treasure on the other side of them.
- **Nether fortress** - Large structures where wither skeletons and blaze spawn naturally spawn. You can also find nether wart here.
- **Ocean monument** – Large building found in deep ocean biomes. Guardians and elder guardians will slow you down in these underwater areas, but if you endure them, you can come away with sponges and prismarine blocks.
- **Ocean ruins** – Buildings that appear underwater and have suspicious sand or gravel blocks around them. Bring a brush to find what’s inside!
- **Pillager outpost** – Towers that are inhabited by pillagers and their captains. Allays and iron golems have a chance to spawn in cages here.
- **Shipwreck** – A broken down ship found in beach and ocean biomes. You can find a treasure map on board that leads to buried treasure.
- **Stronghold** – Underground system of tunnels and rooms in the Overworld where you can find a portal to The End. Libraries are generated here, amongst other things, and silverfish can infest stone bricks.
- **Village** – Many variations of village are found in the Overworld. These small communities have houses for villagers and various items inside them you can make use of.
- **Woodland mansion** – A large building found in dark forest biomes. Evokers, vindicators, allays, and totem of undying can be found here.
