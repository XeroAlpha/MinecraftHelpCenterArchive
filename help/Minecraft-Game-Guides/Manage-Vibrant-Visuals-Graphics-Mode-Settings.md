Download the most recent version of Minecraft to enjoy [Vibrant Visuals](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/chase-the-skies-and-vibrant-visuals-playable-today) when playing. Vibrant Visuals is a Graphics Mode in Minecraft Video settings that is enabled by default on some gaming platforms. Here’s how to access the settings:

## Access Vibrant Visuals Setting

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Settings**.
2.  Select the **Video** tab.
3.  Locate **Graphics Mode** in the Video settings.
4.  Select **Vibrant Visuals** from the Graphics Mode drop-down menu.

### **Vibrant Visuals is grayed out and cannot be selected** 

There are two situations where you cannot change your Graphics Mode to Vibrant Visuals:

- **Actively playing a world:** If you are playing a world and want to change your graphics setting, you need to save and exit the game and enter Settings from the launch screen.
- **System incompatible:** If your system doesn't meet the [minimum requirements](./Learn-about-Vibrant-Visuals-Graphics-Mode.md), Vibrant Visuals is automatically disabled. If possible on your system, try updating your operating system and graphics drivers to the most recent version. 

## Vibrant Visuals Settings Options

The Vibrant Visuals Graphics Mode contains several settings that let you optimize the visual experience for your game platform. If Vibrant Visuals slows your gameplay, try adjusting these settings:

- **Favor Performance**: Select this option if you experience issues with the game slowing or see video issues.
- **Favor Visuals**: For robust gaming systems, turn it all on and experience dynamic lighting effects.
- **Custom**: Experiment with different levels of visual effects to find a mix that works for your system.
- **Graphics Mode:** Select the **Simple** or **Fancy** graphics presets instead of Vibrant Visuals if you can't get advanced graphics to work with your system.
