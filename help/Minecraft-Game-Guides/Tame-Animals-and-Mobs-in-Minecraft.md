You can befriend and tame some animals and mobs in Minecraft if you give them their favorite food! You’ll know if you have a nearby animal’s favorite food if they follow and stare at you. Here’s how to tame them!

## Taming 

Here are the animals that can be tamed in Minecraft and how they interact:

### Wolf

- **Wolves can be tamed by giving them bones**: You may need multiple bones, as just one does not guarantee their respect.
- **Hearts and a red collar will appear after a wolf is tamed**: A tamed wolf will follow you and attack most (but not all!) hostile mobs and players.
- **Interacting with a tamed wolf will cause them to sit**: A sitting wolf will remain in the instructed spot until you interact with them again.

### Cat

- **Cats can be tamed by giving them raw salmon or raw cod**: You may need multiple fish, as just one does not guarantee their love. Crouch-walk to present the fish, or the cat will be spooked and flee.
- **Hearts and a red collar will appear after a cat is tamed**: A tamed cat will follow you, but will not attack others. They will deter nearby creepers and phantoms from attacking you.
- **Interacting with a tamed cat will cause them to sit**: A sitting cat will remain in the instructed spot until you interact with them again.
- **Tamed cats may give gifts**: There is a chance your nearby feline friend will give you an item after you sleep in a bed.

### Horses, Donkeys, and Mules

- **Horses, donkeys, and mules are tamed by attempting to ride them**: Get close to one and interact to get on its back. They may buck you off, but if you keep getting on, they will eventually let you ride.
- **Hearts will appear after a horse, donkey or mule is tamed**: After they’re tamed, you can ride them, but you will need a saddle to direct them. If you don't have a saddle, you can use a lead to guide and keep them from wandering off.
- **Horses, donkeys, and mules can be equipped**: Horses are faster and can be equipped with horse armor to protect them. Donkeys and mules are slower but can be equipped with a chest to carry items.
- **A skeleton horse can be tamed by killing its original rider**: In Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, it does not need a Saddle to control it.

### Llamas

- **Llamas are tamed by attempting to ride them**: Get close to one and interact to get on its back. They may buck you off, but if you keep getting on, they will eventually let you ride.
- **Hearts will appear after a llama is tamed**: After they’re tamed, you can ride them, but they can’t be saddled.
- **Llamas can be led and equipped**: Llamas can be equipped with a chest to carry more items. After you leash a llama, other llamas in the area will follow in a caravan.

### Parrots

- **Parrots are tamed by giving them seeds**: You may need more than one to befriend them. And don’t feed parrots cookies—they’re poisonous.
- **Hearts will appear after a parrot is tamed**: Interacting with a tamed parrot will cause it to sit or follow as you travel.
- **Parrots can perch on your shoulders**: If you walk into a tamed parrot or it flies to you, it can perch on one of your shoulders. You may also hear it mimic the sound of nearby mobs.

### Ghastlings and Happy Ghasts

- **Ghastlings and happy ghasts are passive mobs**: Both can be tempted with snowballs, and the happy ghast will follow you if you have a harness and it’s not already equipped.
- **Ghastlings grow up into happy ghasts**: Feeding a ghastling snowballs will speed up its growth.
- **Happy ghasts can be ridden with a harness**: Up to four players can ride a harnessed happy ghast. The first player to mount gets to drive! They can also be leashed.
