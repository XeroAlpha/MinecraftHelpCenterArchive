You may see unexpected behaviors if you use multiple Add-Ons in Minecraft, especially if they modify the same Minecraft asset.

For example, if you have two resource packs that modify how birch trees appear, the resource pack at the top of the list will take priority and determine their appearance—but this could conflict with another resource pack that depends on having birch trees appear in the way it expects.

When Add-Ons conflict with each other unexpectedly, it’s usually because they’re in the order you downloaded them. Here’s how to reorder Add-Ons to fix resource and behavior pack issues.

## Reorder Add-Ons in single-player worlds

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Locate the World you need to troubleshoot on the Play screen.
4.  Select the pencil icon or controller button to edit your world.
5.  Select the **Resource packs** or **Behavior packs** tab.
6.  Select the **Active** tab.
7.  Select the number of an available Add-On and drag it to the desired position.
8.  Repeat this for any other resource or behavior packs you want re-prioritize.

## Reorder Add-Ons in Realm worlds

You must be the Realm owner to modify Add-Ons.

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play.**
3.  Select the Realms tab.
4.  Select the Realm with the world you want to change and select **Settings**.
5.  Select the world slot you want to change and select **Edit World**.
6.  Select the **Resource packs **or** Behavior packs **tab.
7.  Select the **Active** tab.
8.  Select the Add-on you want to move and select the arrow to move it up or down in the list.
9.  Repeat this for any other resource or behavior packs you want re-prioritize.
