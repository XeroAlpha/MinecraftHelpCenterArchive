Add-Ons can cause issues in Minecraft if they conflict with other Add-Ons or there’s an issue with the Add-On’s resource pack or behavior pack. Here are some suggestions to troubleshoot:

- **Restart Minecraft**: Restart Minecraft if an Add-On crashes or fails to load. It may work on restart. Be patient and allow time for all files to update.
- **Update Minecraft**: See how to [Manually Update Minecraft on Mobile Devices](../Download-Install/Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Mobile-Devices.md), [Manually Update Minecraft on Consoles](../Download-Install/Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Consoles.md), or [Manually Update Minecraft on Windows](../Download-Install/Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Windows.md) and ensure you have the latest version of Minecraft.
- **Disable Add-Ons**: Minecraft Add-Ons can conflict with each other, especially if there are three or more enabled or you apply Add-Ons to a world pack you bought in the Minecraft Marketplace. See [Disable Minecraft Add-Ons to Solve Game Issues](./Disable-Minecraft-Add-Ons-to-Solve-Game-Issues.md).
- **Reorder Add-Ons**: If multiple resource packs or behavior packs affect the same asset, the highest ranked pack will be applied. Follow the steps to [Reorder Add-Ons to Fix Resource and Behavior Pack Issues](./Reorder-Add-Ons-to-Fix-Resource-and-Behavior-Pack-Issues.md) and put the one you want prioritized on top.
- **Activate Add-Ons**: If you accidentally disabled a resource or behavior pack, you can re-activate it from the resource packs or behavior packs section in Settings. See [Activate Add-Ons in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](../Managing-Marketplace-Content/Activate-Add-Ons-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md).
- **Redownload the Add-Ons**: If an Add-On is missing a required resource or behavior packs, or gets corrupted, see [Redownload Add-Ons to Fix Missing or Corrupted Packs](./Get-Help-with-Minecraft-Add-Ons.md).
- **Create a new world**: To determine if a problem is from an Add-On, create a new world, activate the Add-On, and check your world for issues. If you have multiple Add-Ons, repeat this for each one.

If none of these steps solve your Add-On issue, please submit a support ticket through the Contact Support banner at the bottom of the page.
