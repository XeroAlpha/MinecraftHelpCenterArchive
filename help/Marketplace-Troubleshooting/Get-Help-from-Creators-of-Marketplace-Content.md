If you are playing a downloaded piece of content from the Minecraft Marketplace and notice an issue, you can submit feedback directly to the creator.

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Marketplace**.
3.  Search for the content name or creator name.
4.  Click **Submit Feedback** on the Marketplace page dedicated to that content.
5.  Provide a detailed description of the problem you encountered, including how to recreate it, so the creator can troubleshoot.

**Note:** The feedback button only appears for content you have downloaded. The feedback button is only available in Marketplace and will not appear in the Dressing Room.
