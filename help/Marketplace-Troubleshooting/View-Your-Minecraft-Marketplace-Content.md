The Minecraft Marketplace offers enhancements for your game, such as add-ons, pre-built worlds, character creator items, and skin packs. Here’s how to view and activate your content:

## View Your Marketplace Content

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Verify your gamertag matches the account you used to get your Marketplace items.
3.  Select Marketplace.
4.  Select My Content (bookcase icon) to view all your items.
5.  Click on an item to view details and download or activate it. 

## View Marketplace Pass Content

Your Marketplace Pass content is accessible on your account as long as:

- The content remains in the subscription catalog.
- You keep your Marketplace Pass subscription active.
- You are signed into the account used to buy Marketplace Pass. This excludes child accounts if the purchase was made on a parent account.

If you are trying to access your Marketplace Pass or Realms Plus content on a different platform, see [Troubleshooting Missing Marketplace Content](./Troubleshooting-Missing-Marketplace-Content.md).
