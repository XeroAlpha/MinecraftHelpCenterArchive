Minecraft Marketplace error codes start with a letter and a dash followed by the error number. If you receive an error screen when shopping in the Minecraft Marketplace, it means you had an error during sign-in or connection to our servers that is likely temporary. 

## Troubleshooting Marketplace Errors starting with B-, D-, F-, L-, P- or S-

Try the following tips when you get an error in the Minecraft Marketplace:

- **Wait and try again: **You may need to wait for background processes to complete. Verify you have a stable internet connection and try again after a few minutes. See [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md) for tips.
- **Clear your cache:** See [Clear Your Minecraft Marketplace Cache](./Clear-Your-Minecraft-Marketplace-Cache.md) for instructions.
- **Check your game version**: Make sure that your game is up to date and running the latest version of Minecraft. See the below links for help updating your game.
