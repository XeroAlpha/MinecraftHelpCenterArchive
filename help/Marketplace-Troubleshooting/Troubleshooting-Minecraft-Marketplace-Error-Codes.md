The Minecraft Marketplace always has great content for you to add to your world and deepen your Bedrock Edition experience. Unfortunately, errors can happen. When you see a Marketplace error, it will be displayed with a letter followed by a dash. Here is what to know when you get one.

## Minecraft Marketplace Errors starting with L-, D-, S- or P-

These lettered error codes are specific to the Marketplace and indicate that you encountered an unknown client error during sign in. You can try to clear the error by trying the following:

- **Wait and try again: **Verify you have a stable internet connection and wait for background processes to complete. After a few minutes, try to access your Minecraft Marketplace content again.
- **Check your game version**: Make sure that your game is up to date and running the latest version of Minecraft. See the below links for help updating your game.
