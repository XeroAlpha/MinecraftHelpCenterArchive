When you activate multiple Minecraft Add-Ons in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, they can conflict with each other and cause crashes, visual issues, and error messages. If you experience these issues, we recommend you [create a backup](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125) and then disable Add-On resources packs and/or behavior packs one at a time until you identify the problematic Add-On. You can also [Reorder Add-Ons to Fix Resource and Behavior Pack Issues](./Reorder-Add-Ons-to-Fix-Resource-and-Behavior-Pack-Issues.md).

Before you disable Add-Ons in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, here is what to expect:

- **World templates and adventures maps may have required resource packs**: Disable any other optional Add-Ons and create a new world if you’re having issues with these.
- **Disabled Add-Ons will not be removed from your device**: Disabled Add-Ons will still be available in your storage and account.
- **Add-On mobs will be removed**: If a disabled Add-On contains a mob, it will be removed from your world.
- **Add-On blocks will be replaced**: If a disabled Add-On contains a block, it will be replaced with a default block.
