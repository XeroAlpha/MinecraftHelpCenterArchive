If you accidentally deleted a resource or behavior pack from an Add-On, think an Add-On may be corrupted, or see a message about missing dependencies for an Add-On, you can redownload the Add-On to fix issues.

Before you attempt this process, we recommend you follow the steps in [Disable Minecraft Add-Ons to Solve Game Issues](./Disable-Minecraft-Add-Ons-to-Solve-Game-Issues.md) and [Delete Unused Marketplace Content in Minecraft](../Managing-Marketplace-Content/Delete-Unused-Marketplace-Content-in-Minecraft.md) to disable and delete the existing Add-On first.

## How to redownload an Add-On

1.  Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
2.  Verify the gamertag above the avatar matches the account that purchased the Add-On.
3.  Select **Marketplace**.
4.  Select the **bookcase icon** at the top of the Marketplace to open My Library.
5.  Locate the Add-On you deleted by selecting its category or searching for it with the search bar.
6.  Select the Add-On.
7.  Select **Download** and select **Download** from the confirmation menu.
8.  Select **Activate Add-On!** and follow the prompts to apply it to an existing or new world.
