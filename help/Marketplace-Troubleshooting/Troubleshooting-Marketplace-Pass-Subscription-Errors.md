You can [subscribe to Minecraft Marketplace Pass](../Marketplace-Realms-Subscriptions/Subscribing-to-Minecraft-Marketplace-Pass.md) from the Marketplace button on the Minecraft launch screen. Your subscription will use the payment method for the game platform you use to play. If you have problems signing up, check with your platform payment method or contact your game platform customer service for support. See these articles for information:

## Marketplace Pass Subscription Requirements

If your payment method is current and you can make other purchases successfully, check these requirements for subscribing to Marketplace Pass:

- **Bedrock Edition Required**: You will only find the button for Minecraft Marketplace on the launch screen in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. You can subscribe to Marketplace Pass from there. If you play Minecraft: Java Edition, the Marketplace button is not available.
- **Realms Plus Subscription Conflict**: If you’re a current Realms Plus subscriber, you will be blocked from subscribing to Marketplace Pass. Marketplace Pass benefits are included in your Realms Plus subscription. To sign-up for only Marketplace Pass, you will need to cancel your Realms Plus subscription and wait for the subscription period to end.  
- **Bedrock Live Version Subscription Required for Preview/Beta**: Marketplace Pass only works in Preview/Beta after you have already subscribed through the main Minecraft game. You will need to subscribe to it through the normal live version of Minecraft and then restart Preview/Beta for it to work.

**Note**: if you are a Marketplace Pass subscriber, you can upgrade to a Realms Plus subscription without canceling your current subscription. However, we highly recommend canceling your Marketplace Pass subscription as soon as possible as all benefits of it are included in Realms Plus.
