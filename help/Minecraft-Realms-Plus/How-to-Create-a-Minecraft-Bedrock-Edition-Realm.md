If you’re looking to create a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm, this article provides all the steps necessary to get started. For more information on Minecraft Realms, please refer to [this article](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/20688488192013).

## How To Create Your Realm  

You can create a Realm on the following platforms: 

- Android 
- iOS 
- Chromebook 
- Nintendo Switch 
- PlayStation 4 (also available on PS5 through backward compatibility) 
- Windows 10 and above 
- Xbox One and Series X\|S 

1.  To start, you must navigate to the Realms page within Minecraft: 
2.  Launch Minecraft
3.  Log into your Microsoft account 
4.  Select the **Play** button 
5.  Select **Create New **
6.  Choose **Create New World** (or select an existing template) 
7.  Select **Create** on Realm Server 
8.  Select a Realm size
9.  Select **Subscribe Now**
10. Name your Realm
11. Check ‘I Agree’ under the Terms and Conditions tab
12. Select **Subscribe Now**
13. You’ll be taken to the platform store to complete your purchase.

Once your Realm is created, you can join it at any time via the ‘Worlds’ tab in Minecraft.

## Choosing A Realm Name and Size  

Your realm can be one of two sizes, divided into tiers:  

- 2 Users allows for two players simultaneously, plus the owner  
- 10 Users allows for ten players simultaneously, plus the owner  

For more information on Minecraft Realms subscriptions, please refer to [this article](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/22471397285901).

Once you’ve decided your Realm size, you can name your Realm.

## Invite Friends  

After you create the Realm, you will be shown your Xbox friends list so you can invite players. Here you can either invite friends from your existing list, search for friends, or share your Realm using an invite link.

You can always invite friends later from the players Settings menu. For more information on inviting friends to a Realm, please refer to [this article](./How-to-Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).
