## Where can I learn more about Minecraft: Preview? 

[This article](../Community-Guides/Minecraft-Preview-FAQ.md) details everything you need to know about Minecraft: Preview. 

## How to use Realms in Preview

Every Bedrock Realms subscription now comes with the ability to create a Preview Realm. If you have an active Realms subscription and are part of a Preview program on any of the following platforms, you will have the option to create a Preview Realm tied to each of your active subscriptions: 

- Beta on Android  
- Preview on iOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox, and Windows  10/11

Having your Preview Realm linked to your subscription ties it to the regular Realm generated from that subscription. If you cancel your subscription, it will cancel both your regular Realm and your associated Preview Realm.   

Although your regular Realm will be tied to the same subscription, the two Realms will be entirely separate from each other - none of the members, worlds, and settings will carry over between the Realms. This separation ensures nothing happens to your regular Realm. The only thing in common with both a regular Realm and a Preview Realm is that both with be cancelled if you end your Realms subscription.

## What is different in Minecraft Realms in Preview?  

Preview Realms allow you to play the newest experimental features on a Realm with your friends. You’ll also have access to all of the features you’re used to on your regular Realm, except for subscription purchasing and management. To purchase or manage a Realms subscription, you will need to use the regular version of Bedrock.

## Will this change increase my Realms subscription price? 

Nope! Your Realms subscription price will remain the same.

## Can I transfer worlds between a Preview Realm and my Regular Realm? 

To transfer worlds between regular Realms and Preview Realms, you can download your world from your normal Realm, create a new world slot in your Preview Realm, and upload your downloaded world to that slot.

## Are Preview Realms and Java Edition Snapshot Realms the same, or are they cross platform with each other? 

Regular Bedrock and regular Java Edition Realms are entirely separate, each with their own separate subscription. Snapshot and Preview Realms behave the exact same way – they are entirely separate from one another. A Bedrock Realms subscription does not entitle you to a Snapshot Realm, and a Java Realms subscription does not entitle you to a Preview Realm.

For more information on Java Snapshot Realms, please refer to [this article](../Minecraft-Java-Edition-Technical/Realms-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Snapshot-FAQ.md).

## Steps for creating a Minecraft Preview Realm

If you have an active Realms subscription, you will see a prompt on the play screen to create a free Preview Realm.   

**Note: If you’ve switched to Preview’s new user interface, you’ll have to swap back to the old one to access this menu.  **

Creating a Preview Realm ties that Realm to the same subscription as your regular Realm. Cancelling that subscription will cancel both your regular Realm and your Preview Realm.

If you have multiple Realms subscriptions, you can select which subscription to tie to your new Preview Realm. You can then create an additional Preview Realm for each subscription you have through the create new world screen after creating your first one.
