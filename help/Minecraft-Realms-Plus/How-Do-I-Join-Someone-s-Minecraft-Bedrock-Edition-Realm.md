*This article is for Minecraft Realms Plus on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for mobile, Chromebook, Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation® 4 and 5, PC, Windows 10 and above, and Xbox One and Series X\|S. If you want to create a Realm for Minecraft: Java Edition, go to [Minecraft: Java Edition Realms Creation FAQ](../Minecraft-Java-Realms/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realms-Creation-FAQ.md).  *

Minecraft Realms is a multiplayer service that enables you to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition online with two or up to ten of your friends. For more information, check out [Minecraft.net/Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms).  

## How to Join a Realm

From the Friends tab on the Play screen in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, you can view a list of Realms that are available to you. Joining a Realm requires an invitation through a direct invitation or via an invite link. For more on inviting someone to a Realm, please refer to this article.

After you accept a Realm invite, it will be available for you to join. Make sure that you have the [latest public release of the game](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Installation-Issues-FAQ.md#how-to-manually-update-minecraft-bedrock-edition).

A Realm's current status is indicated by the colored dot next to it: 

- Green means that the Realm is open and available to join 
- Yellow shows that the Realm expires soon 
- Red indicates that the Realm has expired or has been closed by the owner 

## Trouble accepting invites or joining Realms

If you’re having trouble accepting a Realm invite or joining a Realm that you’ve already been invited to, ensure that you are not using a modded game client and are using a resource pack that contains textures for the Realm. 

To check which resource pack you’re using, switch to the standard Minecraft game client and follow these steps: 

1.  Select **Settings**
2.  Select **Global Resources**

**Note: If you’re playing on a child account and encountering an error when trying to join a Realm, refer to this article.**

## Leaving a Realm

If you'd like to leave a Realm, do the following steps:

1.  Go to the Friends tab of the Play screen: 
2.  Click the **X** button next to the Realm you want to leave 
3.  Confirm you want to leave that Realm
