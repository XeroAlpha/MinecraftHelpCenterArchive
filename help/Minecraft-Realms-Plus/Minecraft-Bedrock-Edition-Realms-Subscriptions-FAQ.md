## How much is a Realms subscription?

Your realm can be one of two sizes, divided into tiers:  

- **2 Users** allows for two players simultaneously, plus the owner.  
- **10 Users** allows for ten players simultaneously, plus the owner. (Also known as a Realms Plus subscription)  

The cost varies depending on the tier you choose, and is shown in game. If you want to change your Realm size (go from 2 users to 10, or from 10 to 2), you must cancel your current Realm subscription. Once the remaining days on your subscription expire, you can then renew your Realm in its desired size.  

Subscribing to Realms Plus provides you with additional features detailed below.

## What is Realms Plus?  

Realms Plus is a subscription that combines Realms servers with a curated catalog of Minecraft Marketplace content. For one low monthly price, enjoy unlimited access to:   

- A personal Realms server supporting the Realm owner and up to ten friends 
- Cloud storage for your worlds   
- Cross-platform multiplayer for your server across all Bedrock devices
- 150+ Minecraft worlds, resources packs, skin packs, and mash-ups
- A monthly set of character creator items

**Note: For more information on resource packs, skins packs, and other add-ons, please refer to** [this article](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Guides/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Add-ons-FAQ.md)**.**

New marketplace content is added regularly to your Realms Plus subscription in the form of content packs. Content packs are optional add-ons to your Realms experience, and can be anything from new weapons, items, mobs, game modes, maps, and so much more. Your Realms Plus subscription comes with a rotating set of 150+ content packs at no extra cost! 

To search for new content packs, navigate to the **Marketplace** and select the **Realms Plus** tab. From there, select **Content** and **View All Packs**

**Note: Content rotates in and out of the marketplace often. If a pack is rotated out of the marketplace, it will be removed from your download list. Also, any worlds with that pack applied will be unavailable unless you buy the pack itself. However, any Character Creator items redeemed through your Realms Plus subscription are yours to keep.**

## How long will my subscription last?  

On all platforms, subscriptions are available as a recurring monthly payment.

## What happens to my Realms and worlds when my subscription to Realms Plus ends?  

If your subscription ends, you and your friends will no longer be able to play online together on Realms. You will lose free access to the store packs, although you can purchase them individually still if you wish, and you can not upload new worlds into your Realm’s world slots, but you can download anything that was loaded into your Realm for 180 days.

You will be able to download any worlds saved to your Realm and cloud storage within 18 months of your subscription ending.   

If you used worlds, texture packs, or mash-ups from the Realms Plus catalog, you will need to purchase those packs in the store, or, if those packs are still in Realms Plus, re-subscribe to Realms Plus to play those world templates.    

All Character Creator items that you redeemed as a Realms Plus subscriber will remain available to you even after your subscription ends. 

## Do I need Xbox Game Pass or another subscription to play on a Realm?  

Playing on a Realm requires an Xbox Game Pass Core or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription if you’re playing on an Xbox Series console. You do not need a subscription to play on Realms through Windows 10 (or above), Chromebook, or mobile.  

A Nintendo Switch Online subscription is required for playing multiplayer on Nintendo Switch. A PlayStation Plus membership is required for playing multiplayer on PlayStation.  

## How do I cancel my recurring subscription?    

See [Minecraft Realms Plus Billing Issues FAQ](../Realms-Troubleshooting-and-Billing/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-Billing-Issues-FAQ.md#h_01FGCVE88JFXE24WPYJJHZGQ9W) for information on canceling recurring Minecraft Realms subscriptions.  

## Can I use my Realms Plus packs offline?  

You don’t need to be online to enjoy Realms Plus. Packs included in the subscription can either be played online on your personal Realm or played on a local device. You just need to sign in online once every 30 days to validate that your subscription is active.    

## Can I host my Realms Plus worlds, texture packs, skins, and mash-ups on my realm?  

Yes. You can upload any worlds, texture packs, skins, and mash-ups from the Realms Plus catalog or your purchases from the Minecraft Marketplace to your Realm and invite your friends to join for free.    

## How often are new packs added to Realms Plus?  

New packs and Character Creator items are added to Realms Plus every month.    

## How long do I have access to packs within Realms Plus?  

Realms Plus members enjoy unlimited access to 150+ Minecraft worlds, texture packs, skin packs, and mashups immediately upon creating a realm, and retain access to them until either the subscription expires, or a pack leaves the catalog.    

Once you redeem a Character Creator item, it is yours to keep, even if the item leaves the catalog or your subscription expires. 

## If I download a pack, can I access it after it leaves Realms Plus?  

Once a world, texture pack, skin pack, or mash-up leaves Realms Plus, you will need to purchase a copy from the store to continue playing. Packs will not be deleted from your local storage unless you delete them.    

Redeemed Character Creator items are still accessible after they leave the catalog. 

## Where do these packs come from?

The different packs in Realms Plus are from the Minecraft Marketplace, created by a combination of our great community of creators like yourself, and the team here at Mojang Studios. All content in the Minecraft Marketplace is tested for quality and content standards.   

## How many world templates can I play with Realms Plus?  

You can play and save all the packs included in Realms Plus on your local device. You can also host up to three worlds on your Realm, with any amount of packs applied. You select one world at a time as the active world on that Realm. Friends can join the active world for free, even if they don’t own the packs applied to that world.
