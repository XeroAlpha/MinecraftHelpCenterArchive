## General Questions 

### What are Realms? 

Realms are personal multiplayer servers, run by Minecraft, just for you and your friends. Your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition world is online and always accessible, even when you log off. Only people you invite can join your world, and what you do there is up to you: create, survive, or compete!   

### Why are there two versions of Realms servers?

We've developed two separate versions of Minecraft to optimize game performance on different platforms. Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (the version you find on mobile, Chromebook, console, and Windows 10 or above) runs on one kind of code, and Minecraft: Java Edition (for PC, Mac, and Linux) runs on another. These two versions are incompatible with each other and are developed separately with different features. Players on Minecraft: Java Edition can't play on console, mobile, or Windows Realms and vice versa.   

**Note: A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms subscription is separate from a Minecraft: Java Edition Realms subscription.** **Realms subscriptions do not carry over between game versions. If you would like a Realm in Bedrock Edition and one in Java Edition, you need to set up two separate subscriptions. **

### What is Realms Plus? 

Realms Plus is a subscription that combines Realms servers with a curated catalog of Minecraft Marketplace content.  For one low monthly price, enjoy unlimited access to:  

- 100+ Minecraft worlds 
- texture packs, skin packs, and mash-ups 
- a personal Realms server supporting up to 10 simultaneous players 
- cloud storage for your worlds  

New marketplace content is added regularly to your Realms Plus subscription. To link new content to your account, make sure you navigate to the content and click 'download.

**Note: Content rotates in and out of the marketplace often. If a pack is rotated out of the marketplace, it will be removed from your download list.**

### Which versions of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition support Realms Plus? 

Realms Plus is available for Minecraft on mobile devices, the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation<sup>®</sup> consoles, Windows 10 (and above), Chromebooks, and the Xbox consoles. ** ** 

### I’m playing on Windows 10 (or above). Which version do I need?  

You’ll need your subscription purchase to match the version of the game you are playing. For example, if you bought Minecraft: Bedrock Edition from the Windows store, you'll need to buy Realms Plus for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. However, if you bought Minecraft: Java Edition through the Minecraft.net website then you'll need Realms for Minecraft: Java Edition.   

### Can I use my Realms Plus on any device?

Yes. If you purchase Realms Plus, you can access all the packs, your personal server, and storage from any device with Minecraft Marketplace if you’re signed into your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition account.   

### Do my friends need to have Realms Plus to play on my Realm?  

Your friends don’t need a Realms Plus subscription to join a Realm. You can invite any friend to join your Realm for free.   

### Can I play on a Realm with other players on different devices? 

Yes. Minecraft: Bedrock Edition allows players to get together, regardless of which device they're on. Anyone playing on, Android, Amazon Fire tablets, Gear VR, iPhone, iPad, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation<sup>®</sup>4, PlayStation<sup>®</sup>5, Windows 10 (and above) Windows Phone, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\|S. or can play together.  

Players of Minecraft: Java Edition can only play with each other.  

### What are Clubs?  

Realms Clubs are online meeting places created specifically for members of your Realms to share stuff and socialize. In your Club, you can share posts with each other and “like” videos, photos, and comments via a Realm's Feed. Clubs are automatically created for Realms, and only people you invite to your Realm are added to that Club.

However, you must make sure to have your **You can create and join clubs** permission set to 'Allow' if you'd like to participate in a Realm's Feed. You can customize your permissions in the 'Xbox' settings of your [Microsoft Account privacy page](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy?refd=account.microsoft.com).

**Note: You will not be able to see or post to your Realm's Feed within your club if your club permission is set to 'Block.' Realm members with their club permission set to 'Allow' will be able to post in the Realm's Feed.**

![Can](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/16722327722509)

You can access your Realms Clubs from the Xbox App on PC, mobile, or console, or directly from your Realms menu in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If you encounter any issues with using Clubs, please contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/).

**Note: Clubs are not available with Minecraft: Java Edition.   **

### Can I play on a Realm if I have joined the Minecraft Beta on Windows or Xbox? 

No, you won’t have access to Realms while previewing a Minecraft Beta update. 

### Does the owner of a Realm have any special privileges? 

Realm owners of any version get to choose who to invite and may switch between game modes. Realm owners on mobile, consoles, and Windows 10 can also: 

- Generate links to invite new members 
- Download a backup of the Realm 
- Promote other members to operators, enabling them to use slash commands in game   

### What is Xbox Live and why do I need it to play on a Realm? 

[Xbox Live](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live) is the technology Minecraft: Bedrock Edition uses to connect players on console, Chromebook, mobile, and Windows 10 (and above). A free Microsoft or Xbox Live account allows you to track your progress and save both builds and inventory to your profile. This means that every time you play, you can pick up right where you left off. The [Xbox Live Gold](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/gold) paid service is not required.  

## About Subscriptions 

### How much does a Realms Plus subscription cost? 

\$7.99 USD per month in the US. Realms Plus may have slightly different pricing plans for different platforms and countries.  

### How long will my subscription last? 

On most platforms, subscriptions are available as a recurring monthly payment or in packages for six months. Some platforms do not currently allow recurring subscriptions, however.   

### What happens to my Realms and worlds when my subscription to Realms Plus ends? 

If your subscription ends, you and your friends will no longer be able to play online together on Realms, and you will no longer have access to the packs or cloud storage. Essentially, your Realm will be uninitialized.  

You will be able to purchase and download any world templates saved to your Realm and cloud storage within 18 months of ending your subscription unless they are no longer offered by Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.  

If you used worlds, texture packs, or mash-ups from the Realms Plus catalog, you would need to purchase those packs in the store or, if those packs are still in Realms Plus, re-subscribe, to play those world templates.   

### Do I need Xbox Live Gold or another subscription to play on a Realm? 

Only if you want to play online. [Xbox Live Gold](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/gold) is required for all multiplayer services on Xbox, no matter what console game you are playing. Xbox Live Gold is a paid service and is not required to access Realms on mobile devices or Windows 10. To play offline, you only need to sign up for [Xbox Live](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live), which is free.  

A Nintendo Switch Online subscription is required for playing multiplayer on Nintendo Switch, this includes Realms.  A PlayStation<sup>®</sup>Plus membership is required for playing multiplayer on PlayStation<sup>®</sup>. 

### How do I cancel my recurring subscription?   

See [Minecraft Realms Plus Billing Issues FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4410001194765-Minecraft-Realms-Plus-Billing-Issues-FAQ#h_01FGCVE88JFXE24WPYJJHZGQ9W) for information on canceling recurring Minecraft Realms subscriptions. 

### Realms Plus Packs

### Can I use my Realms Plus packs offline? 

You don’t need to be online to enjoy Realms Plus. Packs included in the subscription can either be played online on your personal Realm or played on a local device. You just need to sign in online once every 30 days to validate that your subscription is active.   

### Can I host my Realms Plus worlds, texture packs, skins, and mash-ups on my Realm? 

Yes. You can upload any worlds, texture packs, skins, and mash-ups from the Realms Plus catalog or your purchases from the Minecraft Marketplace to your Realm and invite your friends to join for free.   

### How often are new packs added to Realms Plus? 

New packs are added to Realms Plus every month.   

### How long do I have access to packs within Realms Plus? 

Realms Plus members enjoy unlimited access to 100+ Minecraft worlds, texture packs, skin packs, and mash-ups at launch, until either the subscription expires, or a pack leaves the catalog.   

### If I download a pack, can I access it after it leaves Realms Plus? 

Once a world, texture pack, skin pack, or mash-up leaves Realms Plus, you will need to purchase a copy from the store to continue playing. You will be notified prior to a pack leaving Realms Plus. Packs will not be deleted from your local storage unless you delete them.   

### Where do these packs come from?   

The different packs in Realms Plus are from the Minecraft Marketplace, created by a combination of our great community of creators like yourself, and the team here at Mojang Studios. All content in the Minecraft Marketplace is tested for quality and content standards.  

### How many world templates can I play with Realms Plus? 

You can play and save all the packs included in Realms Plus on your local device. You can also host one of your world templates on a Realm for your friends to join for free. You can change which world you load on your Realm at any time.

## Digital Pre-Paid Realms Cards

From November 24th, onward, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition will begin selling digital Realms pre-paid cards for Minecraft Realms Plus on Xbox and Windows 10 through online retailers such as Amazon. 

### What do I get for Buying a Digital Pre-Paid Realms Card?

When buying a digital pre-paid Realms card, you’re able to pick from either a 3 or a 6 month subscription for Minecraft Realms Plus on Xbox and Windows 10. We do not currently offer cards for the 2-player Minecraft Realms plan or the 10-player Minecraft: Java Edition Realms plan. We only offer cards for the 10-player Minecraft Realms plan on Xbox and Windows 10.

Also, please note that the Realms card might create a new Realm for you even if you have an active Realm. If a new Realm is created, please use this guide to migrate your old Realm over to the new subscription. A digital pre-paid Realms card will never reactivate an expired Realm.

### What Platforms will Realms Pre-Paid Cards Work On?

These cards will launch with support for Xbox and Windows 10 Realms only.

### Where do I Redeem my Pre-Paid Realms Card?

You can redeem your card either on redeem.microsoft.com or through the [Minecraft Token Redemption](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem/lego) page. **Please ensure you’re logged into the correct account before redeeming your code**. Once the card is redeemed, and **your Realm is active**, you can play it on any platform.

### Now that I have Redeemed my Card, How do I Activate My Realm?

All you need to do is log into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on your Xbox or Windows machine, and the Realm should show up automatically.

### I Bought a Digital Pre-Paid Realms Card, but I Want to Refund it

If you’ve bought a digital pre-paid Realms card but want a refund, there are two scenarios you can follow.

If you purchased a digital pre-paid Realms card and have not used it yet, please contact the online retailer from which you bought the card.

If you're having issues redeeming a purchased digital pre-paid Realms card, please [get in touch with Minecraft Support](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001225811). You must have confirmation that you used the card.

### Where can I buy Digital Pre-Paid Realms Cards?

Digital pre-paid Realms cards are available at various online retailers worldwide, such as Amazon. Please check your favorite retailer to see if digital pre-paid Realms cards are available for purchase.

## Technical Questions 

### Can I export my Realms Worlds? 

You can export your worlds from any versions of Realms at any time, including an 18-month period after your subscription has expired. Once your subscription has been inactive for more than 18 months, your world will be permanently deleted from Minecraft’s servers.   

To download your uploaded world(s), start the game and select **Play**, then follow these steps:

1.  Select the pencil icon next to the Realm you wish to download the world(s) from
2.  From the list of worlds in your Realm, select the one you wish to download, then select **Edit World**.
3.  Select **Download World** on the right-hand side to download the latest backup of this world, or you can select **Backups** on the left-hand side if you wish to download older backups instead.
    - To save older backups, just select the download icon next to the backup(s) you wish to download.

You can repeat these steps for each world that has been uploaded to your Realm.

### Can I upload my worlds onto a Realm?  

Yes, you can upload your own worlds to a Realm. We currently support worlds up to 4GB in size. That’s a substantial amount of allotted space! To use a world template from the Minecraft Marketplace, you should create a new world using the template, then upload the world to your Realm.   

### Do Realms servers support modding? 

Realms servers on mobile, console, and Windows 10 support Add-Ons and Marketplace maps, textures, and skins, however, full modding support is not available.   

### Are there any specific settings needed to play on a Realm? 

If you want to participate in a Realm's feed, you will need Clubs permissions on.

Yes, your [Xbox Live](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live) account needs to have two settings enabled:

- Join Multiplayer games
- You Can Create and Join Clubs

**Note: Child accounts do not have these settings enabled by default, so if you have a child account you need parental consent to play on Realms.**

To change these settings, log in to your Xbox Live account on your Xbox console or at <http://account.xbox.com/settings>. For Xbox Live account assistance contact [Xbox Support.](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/) 

For help with a *Mojang account* contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).   

### Can I use admin commands? 

Yes. Owners of Realms on any platform have access to most commands. On Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for mobile devices, Windows 10 (and above), Chromebook, or console, Realm owners can also promote members to be operators, which allows them to use slash commands in-game as well but does not grant them any other admin rights.  

## How to Create Your Realm 

You can initialize a Realm on the following platforms:

- Android
- iOS
- Chromebook
- Nintendo Switch
- PlayStation® 4 and 5
- Windows 10 and above
- and Xbox One and Series X\|S

### Find the Realms Menu 

1.  Log into your Microsoft account
2.  Select the **Play** button
3.  **Create New**
4.  Select **New Realm**.

### Choose a Name and a Size 

Your realm can be one of two sizes, divided into tiers: 

- **2 Users **allows for two players plus the owner 
- **10 Users **allows for ten players plus the owner 

The cost varies depending on the size of the tier. The price available to you is shown in the game. If you want to change the size (go from 2 users to 10, or from 10 to 2), you must cancel the subscription to the Realm. Once the remaining days on your subscription expire, you can then renew the Realm in the desired size. 

### Invite Friends 

After you create the Realm, you will be shown your Xbox friends list so you can invite players. Here you can either invite friends from your existing list, search for friends, or share your Realm using an invite link. You can always invite friends later from the players Settings menu.

**Note:** [Render and simulation distance](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4410246518669-Optimizing-Performance-in-Minecraft-) are locked and cannot be modified on a Realm. As such, these may be set to lower value.

## Admin Options for Realms 

Realms owners have various admin options available for further customization.

1.  Click the **Realms** menu
2.  Select **Configure**

The following **options** are available: 

### Have Multiple Worlds 

In your Realm, you have three different world slots and an additional slot that you can use for minigames. You can have three different worlds loaded in your Realm (for such as two survival worlds and one creative world). Each slot has its own world settings. However, only one slot can be active at a time. 

### Change Realm Slot

If a Realm is misbehaving, cannot be opened/closed, or seems broken in any way, changing the world slot can often help mitigate the problems. Before changing Realms slots, make sure to [backup/save your world data](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409165790605-Managing-Data-and-Game-Storage-in-Minecraft-#h_01FG9YQZTD4SQM2XEP4GC28PW3). More information can be found in [this guide](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/change-realm-world). **  
**

### Adjust the Overall Settings for Your Realms Server

#### Turn the Server On or Off

Select the green slider next to the **on** setting or the gray slider next to the **off** setting to turn your Realm on or off. Turning the server off will back up your world, and then cause the server to go offline; this action will not affect world data or your subscription in any way. 

## Players

### Invite Player

Select the button to invite another player by entering their Minecraft: Bedrock Edition username. The player will be added to your invited players list even if the invitation is not accepted. Invitations that are not accepted within seven days will expire and need to be sent again if you'd like to play with that person. 

### Remove a Player

Select the red **X** to remove a player from your list of invited players.

### Making a Player an "Operator" (OP)

Select the grayed-out crown icon to promote a player to an operator. Operators can use slash commands, send private messages, and set the world spawn point. Operators can't invite or remove players, but you should still pick a player you trust to promote. Select the gold crown icon to make that player a normal user once again. 

### Settings

Lets you set the name and description of your Realm. 

### Subscription

Select **Subscription** to see your Minecraft Realms subscription status or to extend your subscription. 

*Please be aware that Minecraft Support cannot assist with player behavior reports. If you need to report a player, please contact the Realm owner.  
*

## Adjust Settings for Individual Worlds

### Backups

Enables you to see and switch between your backups as well as download the currently loaded backup. 

### Reset

This option lets you generate a new world, load a premade world template, or upload your own world. Note that resetting your world with any of these options will delete your current world and all backups.

## How does Mojang backup your Realm?

A Realm world is downloadable within 18 months, but the world backups associated with that Realm may have been removed depending on our retention policy. In general, we take a backup every 30 minutes while you are playing, and at the end of a play session. We can’t keep all of your backups around forever though. If a Realm world is used actively, the following retention policy is in effect:  

- In the last 24 hours: We retain all backups.
- 1 day to 8 days ago: We retain one backup per day.
- 9 days to 36 days ago: We retain one backup a week.
- 37 days to 121 days ago: We retain one backup a month.
- 122+ days ago: No backups are retained.*** ***

**Note: If you’d like to save a copy of your world indefinitely, we suggest you download your work to your local storage. Also, we keep the most recent backup within each given window above, meaning that as backups age they may move into the next window, which could result in an older backup being removed.**
