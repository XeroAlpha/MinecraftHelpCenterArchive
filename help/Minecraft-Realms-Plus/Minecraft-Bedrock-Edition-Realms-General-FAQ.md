Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms are a fantastic way to play online with your friends. This article includes everything you need to understand the basics of Realms.

## What are Realms?

Realms are personal multiplayer servers, run by Minecraft. Within them, your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition world is online and always accessible, even when you log off. Only players you invite can join your world, and what you do there is up to you: create, survive, or compete!    

## How many people can join my Realm?

Your realm can be one of two sizes, divided into tiers:  

- 2 Users allows for two players simultaneously, plus the owner
- 10 Users allows for ten players simultaneously, plus the owner 

While the 2 and 10 numbers refer to how many people can be on that Realm at one time, you can invite as many people as you want to have access to your Realm.

For more information on Realm sizes, please refer to [this article](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/22471397285901).

## Which versions of Minecraft support Minecraft Realms?

Minecraft Realms is available for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on Xbox consoles, Windows 10 (and above) device, PlayStation consoles, Nintendo Switch, Chromebooks, and mobile devices.

## Can I play on a Realm if I have joined the Minecraft Beta/Preview Program?

Yes! If you have a Realms subscription, you are also entitled to a Preview/Beta Realm on Minecraft Preview or Minecraft Beta. Your Preview/Beta realm comes with all the same features as your regular Realm. For more information, see the [Realms in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Preview FAQ](./How-to-start-a-Minecraft-Preview-Beta-Realm.md).

## Can I play on a Realm with players on different devices?

Yes. Minecraft: Bedrock Edition allows players to get together, regardless of which device they're on.

## Do my friends need a Realms subscription to play on my Realm?

Nope! Only the Realm owner needs to pay a subscription. Any friends invited to your Realm can play at no additional cost.

**Note: Players on Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo will need an online subscription for their respective platform to play on Realms.**

## What are clubs?   

Realms Clubs are online meeting places created specifically for members of your Realms to share stuff and socialize. In your club, you can share posts with each other and “like” videos, photos, and comments via a Realm's Feed. Clubs are automatically created for Realms, and only people you invite to your Realm are added to that club. 

However, you must make sure to have your You can create and join clubs permission set to 'Allow' if you'd like to participate in a Realm's Feed. You can customize your permissions in the 'Xbox' settings of your [Microsoft Account privacy page](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy?refd=account.microsoft.com). 

![Can](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/22472920914189)

You can access your Realms Clubs from the Realms page in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If you encounter any issues with using Clubs, please [contact Microsoft Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/). 

**Note: Clubs are not available with Minecraft: Java Edition. **

## Why are there two versions of realms servers? 

We've developed two separate versions of Minecraft to optimize game performance on different platforms. Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (the version you find on mobile, Chromebook, console, and Windows 10 or above) runs on one kind of code, and Minecraft: Java Edition (for PC, Mac, and Linux) runs on another.

These two versions are incompatible with each other and are developed separately with different features. Players on Minecraft: Java Edition can't play on console, mobile, or Windows Realms and vice versa.    

**Note: A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms subscription is separate from a Minecraft: Java Edition Realms subscription. Realms subscriptions do not carry over between game versions.** **If you would like a Realm in Bedrock Edition and one in Java Edition, you need to set up two separate subscriptions.**
