Preview and Beta Realms are available to any active Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms subscribers. Normal Minecraft and Minecraft Preview/Beta are two separate games. You must join the Preview/Beta program and download and install the Preview/Beta version of Minecraft to create and play in Preview/Beta Realms. See these articles for information:

- [How Do I Join (And Leave) Minecraft Preview?](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/How-Do-I-Join-and-Leave-Minecraft-Preview.md)
- [Minecraft Preview FAQ](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/How-to-Install-Minecraft-Preview.md)

**How to create a Minecraft Preview/Beta Realm**

1.  Launch Minecraft Preview/Beta.
2.  Make sure you are signed into the Microsoft account that has an active Bedrock Realms subscription.
3.  Press **Play Preview** (or **Play Beta** on Android).

If you have an active Realms subscription, a Preview Realm will be available for you to join and add members. New members must also be in the Preview/Beta program to play on a Preview Realm.

**Note:** If you’ve switched to Preview’s new user interface, you’ll have to swap back to the old one to access this menu.

Creating a Preview Realm ties that Realm to the same subscription as your regular Realm. Cancelling that subscription will cancel both your regular Realm and your Preview Realm.

If you have multiple Realms subscriptions, you can select which subscription to tie to your new Preview Realm. You can then create an additional Preview Realm for each subscription you have through the create new world screen after creating your first one.
