The official Minecraft Launcher now includes a “Realms” tab on the Minecraft: Java Edition and Bedrock product pages, respectively. The Realms tab should automatically show up in your Launcher.

In this tab, you can:

- View any Realms you’re currently a part of. 
- Accept or deny any pending Realms invites.
- View a Realm’s description.
- See how many players are in-game per Realm. 
- View any expired Realms subscriptions. 
- Begin a Realms trial.
- Access shortcuts to join a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm if the Realm subscription is active. 
- Leave a Realm.

## Managing Realms in the Minecraft Launcher

Here are some frequently asked questions regarding the Realms tab in the Minecraft Launcher.

### How do I make the Realms tabs show up in the Minecraft Launcher? 

You shouldn’t have to take any additional action – the Realms tab for both games should just appear when you load up the Launcher. This should be true regardless of whether or not you own Minecraft: Java Edition or Bedrock .  

### I am not a Realms subscriber. How do I subscribe? 

To sign up for Minecraft: Java Edition Realms, [click here](https://aka.ms/JavaRealmsWebLink) to go to Minecraft.net to subscribe. For Bedrock Realms, [click here](https://aka.ms/BedrockRealmsWebLink) or launch Bedrock and go to the Realms page in the Marketplace to subscribe.  

### Can I link directly to my Realm from the Launcher? 

Right now, you can link directly to your Minecraft: Java Edition Realms. However, this functionality is not yet available for Bedrock. Instead, Bedrock’s ‘Play’ button just launches the game. 

### Can I manage my Realms Settings from the Launcher? 

You cannot currently edit your Realms settings from within the Launcher. Please refer to [this article](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/15938089626253) if you wish to manage an active Minecraft: Java Edition subscription or [this one](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/15937250579213) to manage a Bedrock Realms subscription. 

### Can I Send or Accept Realms Invites From the Launcher?

You can currently only accept invites that have been sent to you in the Minecraft Launcher. To send invitations, you must go into either game.
