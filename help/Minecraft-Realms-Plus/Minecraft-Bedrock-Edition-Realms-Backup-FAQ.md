## How does Mojang backup your Realm?

A Realm world is downloadable within 18 months of your subscription expiring, but the world backups associated with that Realm may have been removed based on our retention policy. In general, we take a backup every 30 minutes while you are playing, and at the end of a play session. We can’t keep all of your backups around forever though, so the following retention policy is in place:   

- In the last 24 hours: We retain all backups. 
- 1 day to 8 days ago: We retain one backup per day. 
- 9 days to 36 days ago: We retain one backup a week. 
- 37 days to 121 days ago: We retain one backup a month. 
- 122+ days ago: No backups are retained.  

**Note: If you’d like to save a copy of your world indefinitely, we suggest you download your work to your local storage. Also, we keep the most recent backup within each given window above, meaning that as backups age they may move into the next window, which could result in an older backup being removed. **

## How to download or restore a Realms world from a backup

To access the automatic Realms Backups, do the following:

1.  Click the **pencil** button next to your Realm to be taken to the edit page for it.
2.  Select the world slot you want to use and press **Edit World**.
3.  Select **Backups** on the left.
4.  Select one of the available backups on the right to revert that world to that former state. If you want to download that backup, select the download button to the right.

1.  Select the **pencil** button on your Realm to edit it 
2.  Select the world slot you want to download/replace and press **Edit World**.

**Note: Make sure there is enough room to store it on your device!**

You can export your maps from any version of Realms at any time within an 18-month period after your subscription has expired. After your subscription has been inactive for more than 18 months, your Realm and its worlds and backups are permanently deleted from Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers.  

If you encounter an error that prevents you from downloading your world, or if you are having difficulty uploading your world, contact [Minecraft support](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new) for further assistance.
