## Create a Realm

You can create a Realm in Minecraft for mobile, Chromebook, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation® 4 and 5, Windows 10 or above, or Xbox One and Series X\|S in a few easy steps: 

- [Find the Realms menu](#find-the-realms-menu)
- [Choose a name and a size](#chooseanameandasize)
- [Invite friends](#invitefriends)

### Find the Realms Menu

1.  Log into your Microsoft account
2.  Select the **Play** button
3.  **Create New**
4.  **New Realm**

### Choose a Name and a Size 

Your realm can be one of two sizes, divided into tiers: 

- **2 Users **allows for two players plus the owner 
- **10 Users **allows for ten players plus the owner 

The cost varies depending on the size of the tier. The price available to you is shown in the game. To change the size (go from 2 users to 10, or from 10 to 2), you must cancel the subscription to the Realm, wait until the remaining days expire, and then renew the Realm in the desired size. 

### Invite Friends 

After you create the Realm, you will be shown your Xbox friends list so you can invite players. Here you can either invite friends from your existing list, search for friends, or share your Realm using an invite link. You can always invite friends later from the player's **Settings** menu. 

## Invite People to my Realm

It’s easy to invite other players to your Realm on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for mobile, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation® 4 and 5, Windows 10 (and above), Chromebook, or Xbox One and Series X\|S. To do this, you can use the Realms Invite Link feature to easily add more players without having to individually add them to your Realm.

![mceclip0.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4410447587981)

Invite links are custom URLs, unique to your Realm, that you can use to invite new members. When someone clicks on an invite link, they will be prompted to sign in or sign up with their Xbox Live account.

They are then immediately added to the Realm’s whitelist/allowlist, which is your customized list of players you have welcomed to your Realm. Being on a whitelist/allowlist means they can jump into the world right away, even if the owner isn’t online.

If your Realm is getting a bit crowded, you can cancel the old invite link so no one new can use it. Just refresh the link from your Realm’s member settings. Only the newest version of your invite link will let new players join, so it’s up to you if you want to share the new link with a new group of friends or keep it private.

When you refresh an invite link, anyone who has previously joined will still be in the Realm’s whitelist and be able to join the world, but no new players will be able to use the old link to gain access. Of course, no matter what link they have, other players who you’ve blocked through Xbox Live will never be able to access your worlds. If someone has access to your Realm and you block them, they will not be immediately removed. You’ll need to remove them manually from the Members tab in your Realms settings.

![mceclip1.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4410447604621)

So now, whether you want to share your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition world with your family, closest friends, or the whole world, it's easy to add them to your Realm with invite links. Want to know more about Realms? Check out our handy guide, [Tips for New Realms Players](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/tips-new-realms-players), and soon you and your friends can be playing together! 

If you have additional questions, see: [Minecraft Realms Plus Multiplayer Troubleshooting](../Realms-Troubleshooting-and-Billing/Minecraft-Realms-Plus-Troubleshooting.md). 

## Joining Someone's Realm 

From the Minecraft Realms menu in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, you can view a list of Realms that are available to you. Each Realm that you join first requires an invitation, indicated by the flashing mail icon. After you accept it, that player's Realm will be available to you. Make sure that you have the [latest public release](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Installation-Issues-FAQ.md#how-to-manually-update-minecraft-bedrock-edition) of the game. 

A Realm's current status is indicated by the colored dot next to it:

- Green means that the Realm is open and available to join
- Yellow shows that it expires soon
- Red indicates that the Realm has expired or has been closed by the owner

### Trouble Accepting Invites or Joining Realms

Ensure that you are not using a modded game client and are using a resource pack that contains textures for the Realm buttons.

1.  Switch to the standard Minecraft game client:
2.  Select **Options**
3.  **Resource Packs**
4.  Return to the default

### Leaving a Realm

If you'd like to leave a Realm (leave the Realm's player list and delete it from your available Realms),

From the Realms selection screen:

1.  Highlight the Realm
2.  Select **Leave Realm**

## Error When Trying to Play Multiplayer with a Child Account 

Your friends at Minecraft Support have been seeing questions from players who are receiving COPPA or GDPR messaging when trying to access Realms. You might also see a vague message about privacy (we're working on this, we swear!). 

Before you can give kids online and multiplayer access, you need to take a few steps. The account will need to have Xbox Clubs, multiplayer, and online communication turned on in order to play AND an online multiplayer subscription to play online (if your platform requires a subscription). You should also make sure your account payment method is current. 

If you haven’t already done so, read about [setting up your Xbox Live or Microsoft Account](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition/How-to-Manage-Parental-Consent-Family-Settings-and-Realms-Multiplayer-Access-for-a-Child-Account.md). 

### How to Enable Realms 

1.  Log in to [Xbox settings](https://account.xbox.com/settings) with the parent Microsoft account. 
2.  Select the child account's profile.
3.  Select **Xbox One/Windows 10 Online** and choose **Allow** for **You Can** **Join multiplayer games**. 
4.  To enable chat for people not on the person's friends list, they will need to go to their privacy settings and enable **Others can communicate with voice, text, or invites** (second picture below).

![Privacy](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/16722256023437)

If you still need help, please reach out to [Xbox support](https://beta.support.xbox.com/). 

### Features of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition that are restricted without parental verification/consent 

- Minecraft Realms
- Chatting scrolls
- Making purchases
- Changing settings on the Minecraft/Mojang account site

### Playing online with a child account 

A child account cannot access Realms unless the account has been given parental consent. These accounts can still join other private worlds and can play locally. 

### More Help 

If you still need assistance or are unable to pay the parental consent fee, contact [Minecraft support.](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new)

## Realms Settings

### Accessing the Settings menu 

In the Worlds tab, you see a list of single-player worlds and Realms you own. If you own a Realm, you can manage its settings by selecting the pencil button shown to the right of your Realm. 

### Game 

In the Game settings you can edit the name of the Realm, set the game’s difficulty and game mode and reset the world. 

### Members 

This is where you manage who's playing on your Realm. The list shows invited members.

### To invite new members to the Realm

- Select the **Find Friends** button to display your Xbox friends list.

The **Share link** button lets you obtain the invite link for your Realm.

### To remove a player

1.  Select the symbol to the left of that player's username
2.  Select the minus icon.

### Subscription 

From here you can see how your subscription is set up, which size it is, how often you will be charged for renewal, and where you purchased your subscription.

### To Manage your subscription

- Select the **Manage Subscription** button.
- You can learn more about subscriptions at [Minecraft Realms Plus Creation FAQ.](./Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-Creation-FAQ.md#about-subscriptions)

From here you can also close the Realm. Doing so shuts down the Realm and disconnects anyone currently playing on it. No one will be able to connect to the Realm until you open it again. If a Realm with an active subscription is shut, this does not pause the subscription, it closes the Realm and prevents anyone from joining until it is re-opened.

### Backups 

Here you can find a list of backups available for your Realm. Each backup has a date and time stamp for when it was created. To replace your Realm with a previous backup, choose a backup and confirm with the replace option. Doing this deletes all progress on the Realm after when the last backup was saved. To download a local copy of a backup, press the arrow icon to the right.
