Once you’ve created your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm, you’ll want to invite your friends to play along. This article details everything you need to know about inviting friends to your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm.

## How to invite friends to your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm

Once your Realm is created, navigate to the Realms page in-game via the following steps:

1.  Launch Minecraft
2.  Click **Play**![A grey rectangular sign with black text Description automatically generated](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/22471021021965)

2.  Navigate to **Members**![A screenshot of a video game](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/22471067793421)

From here you have a few options to choose: 

### Xbox Live friends list

You’ll see a list of your Xbox Live friends with an **Invite** button next to their names. Simply click **Invite** to invite them to your Realm. Once you’ve invited friends to join your Realm, they simply have to accept the invite and your Realm will show up in their list.

### Find Friends

The **Find Friends** button enables you to type in a player’s Gamertag. This will add that person to your Xbox friends list if they are not on there already. After that is done, you can invite them to your Realm.

### Share Link

The **Share Link** button generates a link you can send to others or post somewhere, like on social media, for players to join your Realm. When your friend clicks this link, it will open a page in a browser letting them see your Realm’s information and your gamertag. If they have Minecraft installed, they can launch the game directly from here and join the Realm.

Be careful about where you post this link, as anyone who has access to it can join your Realm through the page that it opens, so if you use social media to invite your friends, we recommend doing it through direct message. If you feel your link has been compromised, you can deactivate that share link by generating a new one.

**Note: While you can invite as many players as you’d like to a Minecraft Realm, only a certain amount can be online in your realm at one time. That number is based on your Realms subscription. For more on Realms subscriptions, please refer to this article.**
