*This article covers how you can change your Privacy & Safety permissions to utilize Minecraft Realms Stories and join Realms. If you want to know more about safety while playing Minecraft Realms, see* [Minecraft Realms Safety.](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition/Minecraft-Realms-Safety.md)

If your child does not have access to Minecraft Realms or Realms Stories, they may have a Privacy & Safety permission blocking them from seeing that content.  To change these settings for the child account, sign into the family organizer’s account. Go to the [Family Safety page](https://account.microsoft.com/family/home?ref=xboxsupport&refd=support.xbox.com) to see who the family organizer is.

Once you’re signed into the family organizer’s account, follow these steps to change a child account’s Privacy & Safety permissions:

## Changing permissions for your family’s Microsoft accounts on a web browser

*Note: While this article focuses on changing a child account’s permissions from the viewpoint of the family organizer, a solo account that is not part of a family group can adjust their settings if needed this way as well.*

1.  To change the permissions for anyone within your family group, the family organizer will need to go to the [Privacy & Online Safety page](https://account.xbox.com/en-us/settings?gamertag=REV+X+SHADOWS&activetab=main%3aprivacytab) and sign in with the family organizer account. 
2.  Select the account within the family that you want to adjust. Below that selection, click on **Xbox Series X\|S, Xbox One, and Windows 10 devices Online Safety.**
3.  In the list below the Online Safety tab are numerous settings that decide how much that account can interact with other online accounts. For the purposes of Minecraft Realms Stories, you will want to set the two following sections to *Allow*:
    1.  **You can create and join clubs**
    2.  **You can join multiplayer games**

1.  Be sure to scroll to the bottom and click Submit to save your changes. Now the child account should have access to Minecraft Realms and be able to experience Realm Stories! If they are still getting an in-game message saying they need permission to join this content, try restarting Minecraft.
