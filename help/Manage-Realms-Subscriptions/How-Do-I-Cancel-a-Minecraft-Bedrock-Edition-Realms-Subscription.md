For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, your subscriptions are managed through the stores on the platform where you first activated your subscription. Here’s how to access the platform store to manage your subscription: 

Your payment method is managed by the store you bought your Realms subscription on. If you need to cancel it, you can reach the store this way:

1.  Open Minecraft on the device you bought your Realm subscription.
2.  On the title screen, click **Settings**.
3.  On the left, scroll down and select **Subscriptions.**
4.  Click **Manage** under the Realm subscription you want to cancel.
5.  This will open the store management page for that subscription.
6.  When in the store, check your active subscriptions and cancel any future payments.
