**How do I renew an expired Realm?**

1.  Start Minecraft and click on **Settings.**
2.  Navigate to the **Subscription** section. 
3.  Click the **Renew** button on the Realm you would like to reactivate, and then complete the purchase flow to set up a new subscription for that Realm.

**'COULDN'T CREATE REALM RIGHT NOW' ERROR**

If you encounter a 'Couldn't Create Realm Right Now' error, please first confirm that you do have an active subscription within the platform store (IE the PlayStation store, or the Xbox Store, etc) that you purchased on. 

Once you have confirmed your purchase, try restarting Minecraft on that device and check to see if a Realm appears on the worlds list. 

If that doesn't work, please try entering the Marketplace, going to the Realm Plus screen, and restarting the purchase flow by clicking **Subscribe Now**. This should cause the game to retry creating your Realm. You will not need to complete the purchase again, so make sure you do not progress beyond the platform store pop up.
