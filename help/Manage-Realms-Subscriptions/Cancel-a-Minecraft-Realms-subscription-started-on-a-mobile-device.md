Subscriptions for Minecraft Realms need to be canceled through the same account used to start the subscription.Â If you started your Minecraft Realms subscription while playing on an Amazon, iOS, or Android device, you can cancel your subscription on the game platform's website:

## Cancel an Amazon Realms subscription

1.  Visit [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/) in a web browser.
2.  Sign in with the Amazon account used to purchase your Minecraft Realms subscription.
3.  Expand the username dropdown menu in the upper-right and select **Memberships & Subscriptions**.
4.  Select **App Subscription Settings** for the Realm subscription you want to modify.
5.  Select the **Actions** button to expand the dropdown menu.
6.  Select **Turn off auto-renewal**.
7.  Select **Turn off auto-renewal** from the pop-up window.

## Cancel an Apple/iOS Realms subscription

1.  Visit your [Apple account](https://account.apple.com/) in a web browser.
2.  Sign in with the Apple ID used to purchase your Minecraft Realms subscription.
3.  Select **Subscriptions** from the menu on the left-most side of the page.
4.  Locate and select the Minecraft Realms subscription you want to cancel.
5.  Select **Cancel Subscription**.

## Cancel a Google/Android Realms subscription

1.  Visit the [Google Payments profile](https://myaccount.google.com/intro/payments-and-subscriptions) page in a web browser.
2.  Sign in with the Google account used to purchase your Minecraft Realms subscription.

4.  Select **Minecraft: Play with Friends** again on the Payments & subscriptions page to view your Realms subscription details.

When you cancel your Minecraft Realms subscription, your Realm will still be accessible until the renewal date, but payments will no longer be automatically charged. If you still play Minecraft on the mobile device used to start a subscription, see [Cancel a Realms subscription in the Minecraft menu](./How-to-Cancel-a-Minecraft-Realms-Subscription.md).
