When you cancel your Minecraft Realms subscription, you can still access your Realm until the renewal date, but payments will no longer be automatically taken out of your account. Here is how to stop either your Bedrock or Java Realms subscription.

## How to cancel a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms subscription

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition subscriptions are managed through the stores on the platform where you first activated your subscription.  

1.  Open Minecraft on the device you bought your Realms subscription.
2.  Click **Settings**.
3.  On the left, scroll down and select **Subscriptions**.
4.  Click the **Cancel** button under your Realms subscription to open the store you used to start your subscription.
5.  Follow the on-screen instructions to turn off recurring billing or cancel any future payments.

## How to cancel a Minecraft: Java Edition Realms subscription

1.  Sign into your [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/redeem).
2.  Select **Services & subscriptions**.
3.  Find your Realm subscription and select **Manage**.
4.  Select either **Turn off recurring billing** or **Cancel subscription**.
5.  Follow the on-screen instructions to accept the changes.
