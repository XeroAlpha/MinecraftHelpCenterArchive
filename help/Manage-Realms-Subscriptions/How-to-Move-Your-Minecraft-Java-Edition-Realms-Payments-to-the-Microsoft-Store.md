As of September 26th, 2023, Minecraft: Java Edition Realms subscriptions are moving to the Microsoft Store. This means the payment processor is changing from Braintree to the Microsoft Store. If you have not moved your payments over, your subscription will stop automatically renewing November 30th, 2024. Migrate your subscription now to get 90 days free and to retain access to your Realm. If you do not migrate your Realms subscription in time, it will expire. Follow the steps below.

## How to move your Java Realms payments to the Microsoft Store

Please follow these steps to move your Java Realms payments to the Microsoft Store:

1.  Log into your profile on [Minecraft.net.](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login)
2.  Select **Wallet & Realms** section of your profile page.
3.  Select** Transfer** next to your Realm.
4.  Agree to the EULA and Privacy Policy.
5.  Click on **Transfer** once again.
6.  Select **Continue**.
7.  Click **Subscribe** after you select a payment method.

Here are some additional notes on the process:

- **Incomplete Transfers:** If you start the transfer, but don’t finish it, your old subscription will cancel. If this happens, your Realm will expire at the end of your billing period, but it will still be available to reactivate.  
- **First Month Free:** Your first 30 days will be free after your transfer is complete. Following that, your payment method will be charged.
- Manage Realms on Minecraft.net: You will still be able to see your Realms and purchase new ones on Minecraft.net just like before.
- **Manage Subscriptions in Your Microsoft Account:** After your subscription is set up on the Microsoft Store, you can manage the subscription on your [Microsoft Accounts page](https://account.microsoft.com/) along with any other Microsoft subscriptions you have.
