When you play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on your mobile device and start a Minecraft Realms subscription, the Minecraft Marketplace uses the payment method associated with your Apple or Google account. To update the payment method for your recurring subscription, you need to change the default payment method on the account of the mobile device you used to start your subscription.

## Find the platform used to start your subscription

When you view your active subscriptions in the Minecraft Settings menu, you’ll see a note if your Realms subscription was started on a different platform.

1.  Launch Minecraft on your device
2.  Click the **Settings** button on the Launch screen
3.  Select **Subscriptions** from the Settings menu
4.  Locate your subscription in the list
