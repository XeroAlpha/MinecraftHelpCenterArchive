If you get a purchasing error when trying to subscribe to Minecraft Realms, try the tips below.

- **Check Your Payment Method:** Verify that you have sufficient funds available on your payment method.
- **Verify Country of Purchase:** If youâ€™re not in the same country as the credit or debit card you're using, the purchase may not go through. Check with your card provider.
- **Try a Prepaid Card instead:** Consider buying a Minecraft prepaid card from a local retailer. This can then be used to set up your subscription.
