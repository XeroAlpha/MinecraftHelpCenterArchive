## How to receive a gift through Minecraft.net

If you’re receiving a gift from someone through Minecraft.net, please follow these steps to redeem it:

1.  Open an email from microsoft.com. It will include your gift code.
2.  Note down the 25-character code provided in the email.
3.  Use the link provided in the email to navigate to account.microsoft.com
4.  Log into the Microsoft account in which you want to redeem Minecraft
5.  Enter your code into the redemption box and click Next
6.  You’ll be asked to confirm the order.
7.  Once you’ve confirmed the order, congratulations! You now own Minecraft: Java and Bedrock Edition for PC

## Can I gift other Minecraft games through this process?

As of now, you can gift Minecraft Dungeons and Minecraft Legends through this process as well. To do so, please navigate to the following links and follow the steps above.

Minecraft Dungeons: <https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-dungeons-ultimate-edition>

Minecraft Legends: <https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/legends-standard-edition>

**Note: Codes are only redeemable for PC versions of Minecraft and other Minecraft games.**

**Additionally, Minecraft: Java Edition is only available on PC, Mac, and Linux.**

## I’ve redeemed my gift code. Now what?

Once you’ve redeemed your code, you should be able to find both the Minecraft Launcher and the gifted game in your PC game library through the **Xbox App** or in your Library in the **Microsoft Store**.  

## Can I redeem a gift code without a Microsoft account?

You cannot. You need a Microsoft account to redeem a gift code.

**Note: You can receive the gift code from an email that doesn’t have a Microsoft account tied to it. However, you can only redeem the code through a Microsoft account.**

## Can I redeem a gift code through a child Microsoft account?

Some child accounts might require parental permission to redeem a code. For more on managing child accounts or accounts in a family group, please refer to [this article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/add-people-to-your-family-group-4a07b974-8103-16ad-6ea2-46549ca19e03).

## What if my Microsoft account is banned?

If your Microsoft account is banned, you will not be able to redeem a gift code.

## My friend didn’t want the code. Can I send it to someone else?

Yes! All you need is to have your friend send you the 25-character code they received, and you can send it to anyone you’d like.
