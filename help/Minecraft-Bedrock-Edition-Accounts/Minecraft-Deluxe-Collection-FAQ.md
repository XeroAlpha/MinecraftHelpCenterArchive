## What are the Minecraft: Deluxe Collection and Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition Deluxe Collections?

Minecraft: Deluxe Collection is a collection of the Minecraft base game and select downloadable content (DLC), including Minecoins, that may be used in Bedrock Edition’s Minecraft Marketplace.

The Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition Deluxe Collection offers the same set of downloadable content but also includes Minecraft: Java Edition.

**Note: The downloadable content is *only playable in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PC*, so if you’re on MacOS or Linux, we advise you to buy the base Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition instead.**

## What Platforms is Minecraft: Deluxe Collection available on?
