## Why are there black lines on my skin\'s arms?

You\'ll see black lines on your skin's arms if you uploaded and applied a slim-armed skin to a standard model or vice versa. To fix this, upload the correct skin type for the model you\'ve selected.

## Using Skins in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

There are both free and purchasable skin packs that can be obtained in the Minecraft Marketplace. After downloading these skins, you can equip them through the **Profile** menu.

### Getting Started in the Character Creator

-   Click **Edit Character** to equip skins that you have downloaded through the **Classic Skins** tab.
-   On the **Character Creator** tab you can make your own skin, choosing both the body and style features of the skin, along with custom colors.
-   You can have up to 5 saved skins to switch between.

### Uploading Custom Skins to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on Windows 10, mobile, and Chromebook, you can upload your own custom skin by going to **Profile** \> **Classic Skins** \> **Owned** \> **Import**.

**Note: Custom uploaded skins cannot roam to other devices.**
