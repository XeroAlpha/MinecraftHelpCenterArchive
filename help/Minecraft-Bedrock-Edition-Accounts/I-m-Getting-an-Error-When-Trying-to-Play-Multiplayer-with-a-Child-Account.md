If you're getting an error when trying to play multiplayer with a child account, this article should assist you no matter the version you're playing.

Before you can give kids online and multiplayer access, you need to take a few steps. The account will need to have multiplayer, and online communication turned on in order to play AND an online multiplayer subscription to play online. You should also make sure your account payment method is current. 

Note: You do not need Clubs access to play on Realms. 

### How to Enable Realms 

1.  Log in to [Xbox settings](https://account.xbox.com/settings) with the parent Microsoft account. 
2.  Select the child account's profile. 
3.  Select **Xbox Series X\|S, Xbox One, and Windows 10 Online Devices **tab and choose **Allow** for **Join multiplayer games**. 
4.  To enable chat for people not on the child's friends list, select the **Privacy** tab and select **Enable** for  **Others can communicate with voice, text, or invites.**

## For Minecraft: Java Edition 

When you create an account for a child using Minecraft: Java Edition, you need to follow a few necessary steps. The minimum age for a standard account is thirteen. Children under that age need parental consent to access specific features, as required by law.

To give parental consent to access these features, including Minecraft Realms, you must enter payment information, which must be validated with a 10-cent charge. Currently, this is the only method to limit permissions for a child’s account on Minecraft: Java Edition. 

### Features of Minecraft : Java Edition that are restricted without parental verification/consent 

- Minecraft Realms 
- Chatting scrolls 
- Making purchases 
- Changing settings on the Minecraft/Mojang account site 

### Playing online with a child account 

A child account cannot access Realms unless the account has been given parental consent. These accounts can still join other private worlds and can play locally. 

### More Help 

If you still need assistance or are unable to pay the parental consent fee, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).
