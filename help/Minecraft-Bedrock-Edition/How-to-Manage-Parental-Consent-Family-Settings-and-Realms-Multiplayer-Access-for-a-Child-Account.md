Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, Minecraft: Java Edition, Minecraft Dungeons and Minecraft Realms (Bedrock and Java Edition) require an Xbox Live or Microsoft account even if you\'re not playing on Xbox or another Microsoft platform. Parents can set up and manage these accounts for their kids too.

*Please note that Minecraft: Bedrock Edition players on Xbox consoles are required to have an Xbox Game Pass Core or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription in order to access multiplayer features.*

**IMPORTANT:** Child accounts are all accounts for those under the age of 16 for the US & EU, 19 for South Korea. If there isn\'t an adult account associated with the child account, the adult must make a Microsoft account and associate the already-created child account with it. Only parent accounts can modify settings. 

## What is a Microsoft Account?  

It's an account that's used to verify your access to computers and Microsoft services and applications. If you use any of these services, you have a Microsoft account:

  -------------- ------------
  · Xbox Live    · Store 
  · Outlook      · Bing 
  · Office       · Windows 
  · Skype        · MSN 
  · OneDrive      
  -------------- ------------

Your Microsoft account lets you manage everything all in one place. If you need a Microsoft account, you can sign up for one at no cost. See [What is a Microsoft account?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-a-microsoft-account-4a7c48e9-ff5a-e9c6-5a5c-1a57d66c3bfa) for more.

## How to Enable \'Require Approval for Every Purchase\'

If you are purchasing Minecraft: Java Edition or Minecraft Dungeons for a child/minor you may encounter the error that says your account requires a parent or guardian\'s approval to buy things.

In order to allow for the purchase to complete, you will need to disable **Require Approval for Every Purchase** in your Family Safety settings. You can do so by logging into the parent/guardian account for your family group and following Microsoft\'s [Spending limits in Family Safety](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/require-kids-to-ask-before-buying-from-the-microsoft-store-online-f30d6801-165d-9f86-3fe7-063245c0449b) guide.

After disabling this setting, please try your purchase again. If you want to make sure your child can\'t purchase additional things on their own, be sure to enable **Require Approval for Every Purchase** again once you\'ve made the purchase.
