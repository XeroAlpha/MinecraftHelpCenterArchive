## I'm Having an Issue with a Player on a Server 

We occasionally get requests to moderate player behavior or server content and are unable to do so. All servers are privately run, and players are responsible for their actions from server to server. 

-   If you are having trouble on a server that you own, we would suggest researching one of the many anti-griefing mods and [whitelisting](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/whitelist) your server so that only specific people are allowed to play. 
-   If you are having trouble on someone else's server, please contact that server's administrator or moderator team for assistance.  

## How do I know if a server violates the Minecraft Usage Guidelines? 

Familiarize yourself with our [Minecraft Usage Guidelines](https://account.mojang.com/terms#commercial). These guidelines explain how we allow commercial use of the Minecraft name, brand, and assets, including Minecraft servers. 

**Note: If you are not certain if a server violates these guidelines, don't send a report. **

To learn more about servers and how to find a variety of safe options available to play on check out [this page](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408873961869-Minecraft-Dedicated-and-Featured-Servers-Bedrock-FAQ-).

## Where can I submit a report?  

After thoroughly reviewing the commercial use guidelines, you can submit a report using this link: [http://aka.ms/mce-reportserver.](http://aka.ms/mce-reportserver)

## Will I hear back about my report? How will the commercial use guidelines be enforced? 

You will not receive any follow-up information about the reported server. Information about enforcement will be discussed with the server owner and will not be publicly available. Mojang Studios employees don't discuss enforcement in-game. 

## I Want to Report a Bad Guy. Who do I Contact?  

We get lots of questions every day about how to report someone who is re-selling stolen accounts or trying to steal accounts (or bragging about it on social media). We hate that as much as you do.  

We have a whole team of people who are working hard to shut down third-party sales sites and individual Bad Guys. 

If you see someone selling Microsoft accounts, capes, or bragging about stealing them - tell us about it by contacting [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). 

You can help in the following ways: 

-   Don't buy accounts from third-party sellers, resellers, social media, or from your friends. You\'re likely going to lose your money and still have no fancy account. We can\'t help you with those (even if you buy it from a \"friend\") because this violates our [Terms of Service](https://account.mojang.com/terms#website). So just don't do this. 
-   If you see something, say something. Let us know if you see people selling accounts on social media or third-party sellers. Take screenshots. We investigate every single claim. 
-   Don\'t get mad at your friend and accuse them of stealing your account. That\'s a rude thing to do and can get you both blocked from playing.  
-   Keep your account information safe. Use two-factor authentication on your email, use strong passwords on all your accounts, and change passwords frequently. 
-   Don\'t share passwords with anyone - even if you think they\'re your online friend. 

## What do I do if I Think my Account Has Been Stolen? 

**Note:** **In many cases where people believe that their accounts have been stolen or compromised, the issue is caused by a ****[login issue](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409155824269). **

Here are some steps to take: 

-   [Change the password](https://www.microsoft.com/account) that's associated with your account.  
-   Log out of anything that you\'re logged into (websites, game launcher, etc.), then if you were able to change the password, try to log in with the new password. 
-   If you are not sure if you should use your email address or Java profile name to log in, see our article on [Minecraft: Java Edition account types](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408867060621-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Account-Types).  
-   If you do not receive password reset emails within a few minutes, or you are sure that your account was compromised, locate your [transaction ID or gift code](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360029977371-What-is-a-Transaction-ID-) and contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).
