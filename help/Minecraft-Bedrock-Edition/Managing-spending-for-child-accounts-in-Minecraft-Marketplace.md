Follow these steps on your Microsoft Family homepage to approve in-game purchases and set spending limits.

1.  Go to the [Microsoft Family homepage](https://account.microsoft.com/family/home) and sign in with the parent’s account.
2.  Click on the child account.
3.  Click on **Spending Payments & Purchases**.
4.  Select **Add Money** to load a specified amount to your child account. This will allow the child account to purchase this amount without notification.
5.  Select the toggle on **Require approval** after every purchase. This gives no spending limit but requires each transaction to be approved. You will need to add the spending card directly to the child’s account.

You can also manage spending on the [Xbox Family App](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/family-online-safety/family-settings-app/manage-child-content-in-the-Xbox-Family-Setting-app).
