A Minecraft Realm is a subscription to your own personal Minecraft server, where you can easily and safely play online with friends in shared worlds across devices.

Minecraft Realms benefit from our holistic approach to Player Safety, combining the best available tools and processes with a highly trained and dedicated team of passionate people. Our team works every day to celebrate and protect our community’s creativity and passion while ensuring interactions remain safe.

## Community Guidelines

To ensure players have the same inclusive and welcoming game experience when playing any of our games under the Minecraft franchise, we leverage the Community Standards for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards) and [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/legal/community-standards).

These standards set the tone and values our players expect during their experiences and interactions in our games. Those same guidelines apply to Minecraft Realms in various ways.

## Safety features

### Proactive Moderation

Realms features a proactive chat filtering system. We use this system to classify, filter, and escalate online harms such as harassment, abuse, and hate speech. Once escalated, our team manually reviews and moderates these harms to promote safe and welcoming interactions. We also leverage this filter to ensure Realms’ names and descriptions are appropriate.

**Note: For more information about profanity filtering in Minecraft: Java Edition Realms and how to toggle the profanity filter, please visit [Minecraft: Java Edition Realms Profanity Filter FAQ \| Minecraft Help](../Minecraft-Java-Realms/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realms-Profanity-Filter-FAQ.md)**

### Player Abuse Reporting

The goal of having effective and intuitive Player Reporting mechanisms in our games is to empower you. Using these tools, you can let us know when harmful behavior is getting in the way of your Minecraft experience. Please visit [How to Report a Player \| Minecraft Help](./How-to-Report-a-Player.md) to learn more.

In addition to reporting in the game client, players can also utilize the [report a concern form](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4416074743565) to report another player in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

**Note: Minecraft: Java Edition Realms players can also see this [article](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/addressing-player-chat-reporting-tool) and the [Reporting FAQ](../Minecraft-Java-Realms/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Player-Reporting-FAQ.md)to learn more about the Player Abuse Reporting feature in that edition.**

**Additional note: If you are aware of a server that is violating our Community Guidelines, you can [report it here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=11289976570893)**.

### Parental Controls

Since the migration of all Minecraft and Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts, both Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition game clients benefit from increased account security. One example is the ability to activate two-factor authentication, which makes it much harder for intruders to access your account.

Also, Microsoft accounts benefit from parental controls that empower parents to choose what their kids can do in Minecraft online experiences, including what they can access~~,~~ and who can they chat with.

Visit our page on [How to Manage Parental Consent](./How-to-Manage-Parental-Consent-Family-Settings-and-Realms-Multiplayer-Access-for-a-Child-Account.md) to learn about configuring parental controls for the Bedrock Minecraft client, including mobile devices, consoles, and Windows 10.

Visit [this page](../Minecraft-Java-Edition/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Parental-Control-Features-FAQ.md) to learn about configuring parental controls for Minecraft: Java Edition.

### Human Moderation

No Player Safety system can fully and efficiently protect players without human moderators, which is why we invest heavily in building a team with the Minecraft community’s best interests at heart.

To best facilitate a safe and welcoming community for our players, we have a team of dedicated and passionate moderators and investigators that work in partnership with Xbox’s Gaming Safety Team. This team is empowered with specialized knowledge of the Minecraft community and gaming environment. That knowledge is used to review user-generated content and act on verified instances of unwelcoming, harmful, or in some cases, dangerous content.

Of course, no system is a perfect system, which is why we will continue to learn and grow with our community. We also put safeguards in place such as the [appeals process](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360003469452) for players who feel their account was wrongly suspended.

## Xbox Clubs Safety

To do our part in keeping the Xbox community safe and welcoming for all players, the Xbox team monitors for instances of inappropriate club content, as well as for clubs that seek to marginalize and harm others online. To learn more about Clubs’ safety, please visit [Protecting players from offensive clubs \| Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/family-online-safety/enforcement/protecting-players-from-offensive-clubs)
