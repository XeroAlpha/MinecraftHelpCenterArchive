We want Minecraft to be a safe place for everyone, that's why we've added several player safety features to the game and will continue to add more in the future. This article applies to both Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

**Note: It's highly recommended that you update to the latest version of the game, as it includes the newest security fixes and player safety updates, gameplay optimizations, and other great stuff.** \

If you\'re playing in South Korea, you may now see a pop up about the length of time you\'ve been mining and crafting. In compliance with gaming laws, we added gameplay timers and notices to Minecraft in South Korea to help remind players to take occasional breaks from gameplay. These new notifications are active in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.18.10+, Minecraft: Java Edition 1.18.2+, and Minecraft Dungeons 1.14.1.0+.

**Note: In an effort to be clearer and more transparent with you, we have updated the messages displayed when an account is suspended or banned. Our goal is to ensure you know what type of action was taken and why, as well as any other relevant details. Being clear with you is an important part of our ongoing work to make Minecraft a safe and welcoming place for everyone.**

## Overview of the player safety features in each version 

### Newer Game Versions (1.19.1 and up) Using a Microsoft account

-   [Player reporting](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7149823936781), which enables players to report harmful player behavior to our team of moderators.

### Newer Game Versions (1.16.4 and up) Using a Microsoft account 

-   Parental controls, allowing guardians to disable the Chat and Multiplayer features for child accounts in your [Xbox account settings](https://account.xbox.com/settings).
