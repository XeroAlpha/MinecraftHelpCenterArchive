Items downloaded using Marketplace Pass may not appear if you’re playing on a different platform from the one you used to subscribe to Marketplace Pass. Here’s how to activate your content on another platform:

1.  Start Minecraft from the platform you used to subscribe to Marketplace Pass. (For example, if you’re playing on PC but subscribed on Xbox, launch Minecraft from the Xbox).
2.  Visit **Marketplace** to refresh the token on your account which lets us know you're still a subscriber.
3.  Restart Minecraft on the platform where you want to access the Marketplace content. 

**Note:** Your subscription needs to be verified on that original device’s store every 30 days. If you plan on playing Minecraft on a different device for the long-term without returning to the original, cancel your subscription and make a new one on the new platform.
