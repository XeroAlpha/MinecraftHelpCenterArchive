When you play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on your PC and start a Marketplace Pass subscription, the Minecraft Marketplace uses the payment method associated with your Microsoft account.

1.  Launch Minecraft on your device
2.  Click the **Settings** button on the Launch screen
3.  Select **Subscriptions** from the Settings menu
4.  Locate your subscription in the list
