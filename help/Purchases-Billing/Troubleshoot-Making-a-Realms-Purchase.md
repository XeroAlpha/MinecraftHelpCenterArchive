- **Check Your Payment Method** - Verify that you have sufficient funds available on your payment method.
- **Verify Country of Purchase** - If youâ€™re not in the same country as the credit or debit card was issued, the purchase may not go through. Check with your card provider.
- **Try a Prepaid Card instead** - Consider buying a Minecraft prepaid card from a local retailer, which you can then use to set up your subscription.
