If you get a purchasing error when trying to subscribe to Minecraft Realms, follow the steps below to help.

- **Check Your Payment Method** - Verify that you have sufficient funds available on your payment method.
- **Verify Country of Purchase** - If youâ€™re not in the same country as the credit or debit card was issued, the purchase may not go through. Check with your card provider.
- **Try a Prepaid Card instead** - Consider buying a Minecraft prepaid card from a local retailer, which you can then use to set up your subscription.

If you are still unable to subscribe to Minecraft Realms, reach out to [Minecraft support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).
