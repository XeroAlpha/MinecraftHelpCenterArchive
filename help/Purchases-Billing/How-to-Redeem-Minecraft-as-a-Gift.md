If you received the gift of Minecraft through email, follow the steps below to redeem your gift code and download and install the game. While any email address can receive a Minecraft code, you need to sign into the Microsoft account you want to use to play Minecraft when you redeem the code.

1.  Open the email that includes your Minecraft gift code.
2.  Note the 25-character code provided in the email.
3.  Click the **Redeem** your gift button in your gift email or visit the [gift code redemption page](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/redeem) in your Microsoft account.
4.  Sign in to the Microsoft account that you want to use to play Minecraft.
5.  Enter your code into the redemption box if prompted and click Next. If you visit the redeem page directly from the email, you will skip this step.
6.  Check the details of your gift and click the **Confirm** button.
7.  Follow the link on the confirmation screen to install Minecraft or visit [How to install the Minecraft Launcher](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/How-to-Download-and-Install-the-Minecraft-Launcher.md) to learn about installing Minecraft for Windows, Mac, or Linux.

You can also redeem gift codes at [Minecraft.net/redeem](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem).

Congratulations! Have fun shaping your world in Minecraft!
