When redeeming two separate codes for the same value of Minecoins in a row, you might receive the ‘you already own this product’ error. If that’s the case, follow these steps to solve the issue:

1.  Once you’ve redeemed your first code, sign into the account you’re redeeming Minecoins with **before redeeming the second code** and head to the Marketplace.
2.  Select your Minecoin balance to move the Minecoins into your account.
3.  Redeem the second code.
