At the launch of Minecraft Dungeons, there was an issue that would wipe all save data in the game. With the release of the 1.2.0.0 hotfix, we fixed the data loss issues that were occurring on the Windows version of Minecraft Dungeons. If you were affected by this issue and lost your character’s progress, we want you to have the opportunity to download a built-up character so you don’t have to start over completely. This article explains how to download and install the character save file. 

**Character Stats:** 

- Level 36 / Power 35 
- All main missions unlocked on default difficulty 
- Ample gear and artifacts to get you back into the fight 

**Download:** 

[minecraft-dungeons-save-level-36.zip](https://www.minecraft.net/content/dam/games/dungeons/software/minecraft-dungeons-save-level-36.zip) 

**Note:** This save file can only be used on Windows PCs.
