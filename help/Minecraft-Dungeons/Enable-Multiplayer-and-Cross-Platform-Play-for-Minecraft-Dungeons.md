To play online multiplayer and cross-platform play in Minecraft Dungeons on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation® consoles, you need to log in to the game using a Microsoft Account. This section explains how to log in and begin adding friends to play together online.

If you do not have a Microsoft Account, you can create one for free by following the directions in [Set Up Microsoft Family Accounts For Minecraft Multiplayer Games](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition/Set-Up-Microsoft-Family-Accounts-for-Minecraft-multiplayer-games.md).

Once you have a Microsoft account, follow these steps:

1.  Launch Minecraft Dungeons.
2.  Open **Settings** on the main menu.
3.  Select **Game**.
4.  Select **Configure Cross-Platform Play**.
5.  Select **Activate Cross-Platform Play**.
6.  Select **Link Account**.
7.  Go to the [Microsoft Link](https://login.live.com/oauth20_remoteconnect.srf) page on a browser.
8.  Enter the code shown on your device.
9.  Sign in to your Microsoft account on the browser.

When your browser gives the “All done!” message, wait for your game to update with your account.

After you connect your Microsoft account, Minecraft Dungeons cross-platform play will be enabled by default. If you ever want to disable it or unlink your Microsoft account, return to the **Configure Cross-Platform Play** page in the game settings.
