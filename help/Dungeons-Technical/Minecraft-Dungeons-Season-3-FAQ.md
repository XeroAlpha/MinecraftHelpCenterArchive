This article answers everything you need to know about Minecraft Dungeons Season 3.

## What is Season 3?

Season 3, also known as Fauna Faire, introduces all sorts of tweaks and adjustments that will enhance your Dungeons experience, with many changes based on *your* feedback.

## What Changes can I Expect in Minecraft Dungeons Season 3?

Let’s go over some of the changes you can expect in Dungeons Season 3.

### 4-Player Tower Co-Op

One of the biggest changes coming to Minecraft Dungeons with Season 3 is 4-player Tower co-op.

Previously, you could only tackle the tower alone. Now, you can do so with up to four players in online or local co-op. Players can drop-in or drop-out of co-op at any time.

When playing co-op, you and your team will share a pool of lives. The Tower difficulty will scale based on the number of players present, increasing mob amounts and health counts as your party grows larger.

**Note: The Tower supports four player online *or* local co-op, but not both at the same time. For example, you cannot have a session with two players connected via the internet and two players connected locally.**

### Tower Enhancements

Aside from adding multiplayer, we have adjusted various existing tower rooms to fix bugs and make tweaks based on player feedback.

We’re also adding new floors/biomes to the Tower based on existing missions! This will vary the experience for even our most dedicated players. While these latest Tower floor themes are based on some of our DLC packs, anyone can play them even if they haven’t purchased DLC.

### New Mission: Treetop Tangle

Treetop Tangle is our latest mission, taking place in the Jungle biome. This mission consists of players making their way to the top of the huge tree to discover the secrets lying in wait.

Finally, Treetop Tangle includes brand new gear rewards: the Totem of Casting and the Root Rot armor alongside its unique variant, Black Spot armor​.

### Camp Changes

You’ll notice a few new changes at the camp, as well. For one, it’s daytime again! Spending time at the camp now has more of a late summer feel, with flowers and pets decorating the area.

There’s also a new merchant at the camp, the Enchantsmith. The Enchantsmith allows you to re-roll one enchantment on your gear by spending gold. You can continue re-rolling that enchantment as much as you’d like, but each subsequent re-roll costs more gold than the last! Be wary!

### Adventure Pass

The Season 3 Adventure Pass will have more pets than any previous season, with all rewards having an animal theme to them. Just like our other Adventure Passes, the Season 3 pass never expires, meaning you can earn its rewards long after this update’s release.

### Quality of Life Improvements

We’ve added a ‘Random Mission’ button to the map screen. Players who choose a random mission will earn additional Adventure Points for their bravery, providing an alternative way to rank up your Adventure Pass faster than playing through pre-selected missions.

Speaking of the Adventure Pass, we’ve added some User Interface updates that make it easier to swap between seasons. In addition, we’ve made it easier to tell which season your Adventure Pass points go towards when you’re in the menus.

Of course, this list only covers *some* of the changes made in Season 3 of Minecraft Dungeons. You’ll have to discover the rest on your own! We hope you enjoy this latest update, and we’ll see you in-game!
