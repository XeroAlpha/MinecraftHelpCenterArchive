If you have a hero that you have put a lot of hard work into building up in Minecraft Dungeons, you should be able to continue using them even if you are playing the game on a different platform. Luckily, Minecraft Dungeons has cloud saves. To make use of this feature, you will need to sign into a Microsoft account when you play the game. See [Enable Multiplayer and Cross-Platform Play for Minecraft Dungeons](./Minecraft-Dungeons-Download-and-Installation-FAQ.md) for more info.

**How to upload a hero to the cloud in Minecraft Dungeons**

To upload a hero to the cloud so you can play them on a different platform, follow these steps:

1.  Start Minecraft Dungeons on the original platform where your hero was created.
2.  Open **Hero Settings**.
3.  Have the hero on screen.
4.  Select **Upload Hero**.
5.  Select an Empty Slot to put your hero in. If you select a slot that already has a hero, they will be overwritten on the cloud.
6.  Confirm the upload.

**How to download a hero from the cloud in Minecraft Dungeons**

After a hero has been uploaded to the cloud in Minecraft Dungeons, you can then download them on a separate platform if you are signed in to your Microsoft account.

1.  Start Minecraft Dungeons on the secondary platform.
2.  Select **Hero Settings**.
3.  Move to a slot that does not have a hero occupied.
4.  Select **Download Hero**.

Your hero and all of their gear will become available when the download is completed.

**Note:** Any changes made to your hero will need to be uploaded back to the cloud then downloaded on the original platform for them to take effect on that other platform.
