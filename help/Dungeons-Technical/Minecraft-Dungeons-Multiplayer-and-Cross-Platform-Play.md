Team up with friends across consoles and PCs. Create a multiplatform alliance and battle together with the cross-platform play-free game update to Minecraft Dungeons. This update allows for cross-platform multiplayer playing across Nintendo Switch, PlayStation® 4 and 5, Windows PC, and Xbox. 

Make sure that your Minecraft Dungeons game is updated to the latest version before playing multiplayer. To ensure you’re up to date, to find out how to locate your version number and more, see [How to Update Minecraft Dungeons](./Enable-Multiplayer-and-Cross-Platform-Play-for-Minecraft-Dungeons.md#h_01FG7WEN7BM1GT5NQW3HHP7791).

**Online Play ** 

Minecraft Dungeons can be played online with 2-4 players. The game’s difficulty will change based on how many players are within the game, becoming more difficult the more friends that join. You can also start an online game by yourself and have others join your quest for glory while your game is in progress. 

**Enable Cross-Platform Multiplayer Play** 

For steps on playing Minecraft Dungeons across platforms, see [Enable Multiplayer And Cross-Platform Play For Minecraft Dungeons](./Enable-Multiplayer-and-Cross-Platform-Play-for-Minecraft-Dungeons.md).

**Cloud Saves** 

Cloud Saves are now available in Minecraft Dungeons and can be used between Nintendo Switch, PlayStation® 4 and PlayStation® 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\|S. See [Upload And Download Heroes To The Cloud In Minecraft Dungeons](./Upload-and-Download-Heroes-to-the-Cloud-in-Minecraft-Dungeons.md) to learn how.
