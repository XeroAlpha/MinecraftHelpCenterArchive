**![patchnotes_1.17.0.0.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/10971416444301)**

## **1.17.0.0 - November 30, 2022**

**Weekly Tower Rotation:**

As of November 20, 2022, the Tower has started to rotate more frequently than ever. From this date, weekly Towers offer fresh loot, improved floor presets, and some challenges (and bosses) from downloadable content (DLC) missions! Special gear from previous seasonal events is also obtainable as rewards from playing the Tower.

For more information, check out the [article on minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/dungeons--new-tower-rotations)!

**Balancing:**

**Enchantsmith**

We have lowered the Enchantsmith costs and scaling to be much more favourable and increased both consistent rate of gold drops from Ancient Hunt chests, along with the end of level reward to add an overall more inflated gold economy.

**Enchantsmith Merchant**

- Base charge (Item level 1) from 100 \> 20
- Price increase per re-roll from 5% \> 10%
- Item power scaler from 1 \> 0.65
- Maximum re-roll price from 250 \> 100

**Ancient Hunts**

- Gold Chest
  - Min Gold from 2 \> 4
  - Max Gold from 5 \> 6
- Rare Gold Chest
  - Min Gold from 4 \> 8
  - Max Gold from 7 \> 10

**Weapons**

- Many unique variants of weapons have been brought in line with their non-unique selves after the previous balance patch including:
  - Sun’s Grace ([MCD-7460](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCD-7460))
  - Flail
  - Shrieking Crossbow ([MCD-7512](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCD-7512))
  - Bone Cudgel ([MCD-7509](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCD-7509))
- Sponge Striker
  - Sponge Striker now correctly scales damage with difficulty ([MCD-5935](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCD-5935))
  - Sponge Striker now deals damage as a cleave applied to the last arc of an attack combo, rather than only applying to the initially targeted enemy

**Gravity Enchantment**

- Gravity affecting players now lasts for 1 second instead of 4 seconds
- Ranged attacks with the Gravity enchantment will now trigger the Gravity FX in the correct location, making it easier to see what is being affected and from where

**Fixes:**

**Performance / Stability**

**1.16.3.0 - October 25, 2022**

A hotfix has been released to address a couple of issues that have occurred since the launch of Fauna Faire. This update is only available on Steam (1.16.3.0) and Nintendo Switch (1.19.2.0). The team is hard at work on additional fixes, and we'll have more to share soon!

- Fixed Steam achievements not unlocking properly
- Fixed issues with rewards not being claimable within the Adventure Hub on Nintendo Switch

**1.16.2.0 - October 19, 2022**

Come one, come all to the warmest, friendliest, and mob-densest celebration this side of the Overworld. Fauna Faire is setting up camp, bringing with it both blazing activities and fun festivities – all in the spirit of friendship and camaraderie. Unite with friends and take on new challenges together, such as Tower multiplayer mode featuring additional floor variations, or the unexplored jungle mission, Treetop Tangle. Make new buddies among a plethora of pets in the seasonal reward tracks or embrace the look of your favorite friendly mob with one of the many new skins available. And while you’re at it, don’t forget to strike a deal with the Enchantsmith. Who will you bring to the faire?

We appreciate your continued support in reporting issues! If you’re looking to join a community of like-minded players, hit up the official Minecraft Dungeons Discord server at [discord.gg/MinecraftDungeons](https://discord.gg/MinecraftDungeons).  
  
**NOTE:** This update will appear on Nintendo Switch as 1.16.1.0 and all other platforms as 1.16.2.0  
  

**Tower Multiplayer:**

The Tower is expanding – both when it comes to the variety of floors you can encounter, and the number of players in a run! Fauna Faire’s new Tower multiplayer mode supports four players and puts bigger focus on team collaboration in order to overcome threats as you ascend to the top.

![tower.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9863531542925)

- Up to 4 players can join in online multiplayer or up to 4 players in local multiplayer
- Players have a shared pool of lives during a Tower run
- Difficulty scales based on the number of players with increased mob health and mob count

There are also improvements to the Tower, whether playing singleplayer or multiplayer:

- New Tower floors featuring Cacti Canyon, Windswept Peaks, and Broken Citadel
- New floors have been added to various Towers which add the Ancient Guardian and Tempest Golem!  
    

**Treetop Tangle:**

Located somewhere deep within the lush forests of the Jungle Island, Treetop Tangle is a new free mission to explore together with like-minded adventurers. Players who come here will have to prepare themselves for a long climb up a giant tree if they want to discover its secrets. The journey will surely be challenging, but possibly also rewarding as the mission is said to contain some previously undiscovered pieces of gear…

![treetop.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9863588376333)

Find the mission in the Island Realms on the mission select screen, even if you don’t own the Jungle Awakens DLC.

New gear to find:

- Totem of Casting
- Root Rot Armor
- Black Spot Armor (Unique)  
    

**Enchantsmith:**

The rumors of a new merchant villager lurking somewhere on the outskirts of the camp were true! The Enchantsmith has arrived just in time for the faire and has set up shop eight o’clock of the Adventure Hub (that’s southwest for all you non-clock navigators).

![enchantsmith.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9863614008589)

- Utilize their craftmanship to re-roll enchantments on your favorite pieces of gear!
- Each roll on a single piece of gear increases the cost with Gold
- The Enchantsmith can be unlocked by rescuing the merchant in Highblock Halls  
    

**Random Mission:**

A new button has been added to the mission select screen that sends players into a random mission, gaining an additional boost in Adventure Points upon completion of the mission. This feature is available for players that have completed Obsidian Pinnacle on Default difficulty.

![random.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9863646102541)  
  

**Seasonal Adventure:**

Fauna Faire brings an animal-focused late summer to the camp. This means there will be an abundance of furr-tastic skins, pets, and other mob-themed cosmetic items to add to your closet. Whether you want to embrace your inner chicken or show off your mighty paw-er, there’s something for everyone. And just as with previous seasonal adventures, Fauna Faire offers two reward tracks – one free and one Adventure Pass track.

![seasonal.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9863649102861)

The active season can be changed in the Adventure Hub so you can still earn rank and rewards from Seasons 1 and 2. Setting the season in the Adventure Hub will make all Adventure Points go toward ranking up in the selected season!  
  

**New Achievements:**

**The Tower:**

The Tower is a new gameplay area, available for all players as part of the free Cloudy Climb update.

In the Tower, the player controls an avatar: a character that initially has no gear, but slowly collects it through a selection of rewards you earn as you progress. The Tower itself has 30 different floors, with each one harder than the previous one, and the goal is to make it as high up as you possibly can for the best rewards!

![cloudyclimb-1.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4416478182797)

The Tower is home to both familiar mobs and bosses from Minecraft Dungeons – but also a few new foes as well. Not all Tower inhabitants are hostile and some of them will help you along your way up by modifying the gear that you collect. They can increase the power of it, upgrade it to a unique variant, or gild it.

The Tower’s floors will change every few weeks, which gives you a limited window to master its current layout.

**Seasonal Adventure Rewards and Progression:**

A new progression system has been added to Minecraft Dungeons, allowing new cosmetic rewards to be unlocked, including capes, emotes, pets, flairs, and skins.

![cloudyclimb-2.jpg](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4416478188941)

Adventure Points are gained through regular gameplay or by completing weekly challenges in the game. The more points you earn, the higher your Adventure Rank becomes, unlocking even greater rewards.

![cloudyclimb-3.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4416478188173)

Accessing the Adventure Hub from The Camp allows you to see your current progress towards rewards and challenges. There is a free track of rewards that is available to all players, as well as a premium track that is available to those who purchase the Season 1 Adventure Pass.

**Free Update:**

**Ancient Hunts**

Ancient Hunts are procedurally-generated end-game missions that weave in and out of the Nether. To access an Ancient Hunt, you’ll need to sacrifice some of your items. The combination of items changes which rare Ancient mobs you may encounter. Investing enchantment points further increases your chances to encounter ancient mobs. Defeating these mobs gives you brand-new Gilded gear, which is more powerful than anything you’ve yet encountered!

**Gilded Gear**

Gilded gear drops are part of the free update as ultra-rare items with an extra Enchantment slot built-in, making them some of the most powerful items in the game. To get these end-game level items, you’ll have to face the Ancient Hunts and travel to the dangerous Nether.

**Gold Currency and Piglin Merchant**  
Once you get your first bit of gold from Ancient Hunts, the Piglin merchant will set up shop in the mysterious cave that’s popped up near camp. Trade the gold for items and possibly even rare Gilded gear!

Please note that gold must be earned in-game and cannot be purchased!

**New Enchantments**

- Pain Cycle (Melee)
- Artifact Synergy (Melee)
- Cooldown Shot (Ranged)
- Shock Web (Ranged)
- Artifact Charge (ranged)
- Reckless (Armor)
- Beast Burst (Armor)
- Beast Boss (Armor)
- Beast Surge (Armor)
- Fire Focus (Armor)
- Lightning Focus (Armor)
- Poison Focus (Armor)
- Soul Focus (Armor)

**10 Million Heroes**

- The Minecraft Dungeons community has reached ten million players! To celebrate the amazing players supporting the game, we’re releasing a free cape and pet as part of this update

**Return to Checkpoint**

- If you ever find yourself stuck in the world and unable to move head to the menu and select Return to Checkpoint!

**New Achievements**

- 10 new achievements/trophies to unlock on your adventures

**Xbox Series X\|S Enhanced**

- Minecraft Dungeons is now optimized for Xbox Series X\|S consoles!
- Xbox Series X supports up to 4K resolution and 120 FPS
- Xbox Series S supports up to 1440p resolution and 60 FPS
- These resolutions and frame rates are variable, and will lower while playing four player local co-op

**Flames of the Nether DLC:**

**DLC Features**

- Journey to the heart of the Nether in six new missions that will let you explore from the Minecraft universe in an all-new way. The adventure ahead will bring new artifacts and gear for those who are brave enough to face the fiery wrath of the Nether’s dangerous mobs.
- Two new player skins and a Baby Ghast pet

**New Weapons**

- Broken Sawblade
- Mechanized Sawblade (Unique)
- Boneclub
- Bone Cudgel (Unique)
- Twisting Vine Bow
- Weeping Vine Bow (Unique)
- Cog Crossbow
- Pride of the Piglins (Unique)

**New Armor**

- Sprout Armor
- Living Vines Armor (Unique)
- Piglin Armor
- Golden Piglin Armor (Unique)

**New Artifacts**

- Blast Fungus
- Powershaker
- Spinblade
- Thundering Quiver

**Balance Changes:**

**Arch Haven and Soggy Cave**

- The unlock locations of these secret missions now always appear on Pumpkin Pastures and Soggy Swamp

**Apocalypse Plus**

- The previous twenty Apocalypse Plus levels have been compressed into ten levels
- Characters that had reached +20 prior to this update will now have +10 unlocked. Their gear will remain unchanged
- 15 additional Apocalypse Plus levels have been added, bringing the total up to 25
- Each Apocalypse Plus level now increases gear power and mob stats more than previously
- The difficulty curve has been adjusted behind the scenes such that Apocalypse Plus gives you a similar or slightly more difficult degree of challenge early on, but is significantly easier towards the end
- Every third Apocalypse Plus level now requires completing one or multiple boss missions to finish. Sorry, that means you can't get to the end by playing Arch Haven many times over!
- There is no longer a small chance for mobs to respawn while playing on high Apocalypse Plus levels
- Drastically lowered the frequency of tier 2 and 3 variants of mobs (such as armored Zombies and Illagers) on Apocalypse Plus difficulty. This makes the gameplay feel more varied and alternating in pace and level of challenge when fighting mobs

**Mob Enchantments**

- Electrified interval from every 5s -\> 4s
- Electrified damage from 150 -\> 90
- This means that Electrified’s damage per second from mobs has gone from 30 to 22.5

**Blacksmith**

- Each apocalypse plus threshold is now also a threshold for upgrading items at the Blacksmith

**Enchantment Slots**

- Bosses in Apocalypse are now more likely to drop triple-enchanted items
- Item drops now become guaranteed to have three enchantment slots partway through Apocalypse Plus

**Artifact Cooldown Effects**

- Cooldown decrease from armor buffed from 30% to 40%
- Cooldown decrease from a single enchantment slot buffed from ~30% to ~40%
- Stacked cooldown decreases from multiple sources of different types will now have diminished benefits
  - Example: Using Evocation Robes and 3x maxed out Cooldown enchantments, the cooldown change would go from an 87% decrease to a 77% decrease
- Overall, this is a buff to most cooldown combinations, and a slight nerf to cooldown builds that use a cooldown armor with two or more stacked Cooldown enchantment slots. We're hoping it will free up some enchantment slots for use on other things, while simultaneously fixing a few issues with stacking cooldowns we had previously

**Ravager**

- Charge attack damage 350 -\> 175

**Rampart Captain**

- Damage 440 -\> 300

- Updraft damage 110 -\> 80

- Lift gates in Windswept Peaks now play sounds when opening and closing
- Improved line spacing of text in several areas of the menus

**Known Issues:**

- In rare cases, multiple Ancient Mobs may spawn at once

- Rarely, rolling off the map in certain areas in Warped Forest may cause the player to respawn at the beginning of an Ancient Hunt
