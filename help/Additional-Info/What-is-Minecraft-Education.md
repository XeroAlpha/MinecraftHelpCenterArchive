Minecraft Education is a version of Minecraft designed for education in a classroom setting. Education allows teachers to offer a fun and interactive lesson for their students through playing the game of Minecraft. Students of all ages can learn from this edition. Educators can create their own lesson plans using the resources available to them in-game. In addition, there are multiple lesson plans already available that cover a variety of subjects like language arts, science, history and culture, computer science, art and design, and math. To learn more about these lesson plans, see our [Subject Kits page](https://education.minecraft.net/class-resources/lessons/).

## Minecraft Education Features 

Minecraft Education contains additional features and resources from the original game to help foster a better learning environment. Some of these features include:  

- **Border blocks** These are blocks that prevent players from being able to walk across them. This border extends the full range of the Y coordinate. Helpful for keeping players corralled.   
- **Allow and deny blocks** Used to allow or deny players form building in specific areas.  
- **Camera and Portfolio** These allow players to take pictures of themselves and their surroundings. These pictures are saved in their portfolio.  
- **Chalkboards** Used to write messages. Chalkboards can differ in size and can be used to explain instructions or learning goals.   
- **Non-player characters (NPCs)** Educators can create an NPC to act as a guide for students. These NPCs can be named and share messages with students. Along with messages, the NPC also can link to URLs for additional information.
