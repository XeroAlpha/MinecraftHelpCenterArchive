## This article goes alongside a video tutorial for Minecraft Legends. For the best tutorial experience, please read the following text alongside **[this video](https://youtu.be/6v9gQhOARsc)**. 

## Gathering resources from chests

You’ll often find chests while exploring the Overworld. Opening them provides you with resources.

### Xbox Controller

- Approach the chest and hold the ‘X’ button to open it.

### Mouse and Keyboard

- Approach the chest and hold the ‘Q’ key to open it.

## Building a Unit Spawner

Unit spawners are great for creating new units to follow you, or to recall already-spawned units that exist on the field.

### Xbox Controller

- Press ‘Down’ on the d-pad to activate the Combat Hotbar.
- Enter Build view while hovering over a golem spawner.
- Use the Right Stick to drag the spawner to your desired spot as you did in the previous tutorial.
- Press the Right Trigger to confirm the build.

### Mouse and Keyboard

- Press ‘X’ to activate the Combat Hotbar.
- Enter Build view while hovering over a golem spawner.
- Drag the spawner to your desired spot as you did in the previous tutorial.
- Press the left mouse button to confirm the build.

## Spawning Units

Once you’ve built a unit spawner, stand near or on top of it to recall your existing units or to spawn new ones. Remember, spawning a basic unit costs lapis, which you can find in chests or by defeating piglins.

### Xbox Controller

- When standing on or near a unit spawner, hold ‘X’ to spawn new units, or hold ‘B’ to recall all spawned units that you aren’t currently controlling to your position.
- To spawn more units, continue to hold ‘X.’

### Mouse and Keyboard

- When standing on or near a unit spawner, hold ‘Q’ to spawn new units, or hold ‘E’ to recall all spawned units that you aren’t currently controlling to your position.
- To spawn more units, continue to hold ‘Q.’

## Rallying Units

Once your units are spawned, you must rally them so they’ll follow you around the Overworld and into battle.

### Xbox Controller

- Stand near your units and press 'X' to rally them.
- If you'd like them to stop, hold 'X' again.

### Mouse and Keyboard

- Stand near your units and press ‘Q’ to rally them!
- If you’d like them to stop following you, hold ‘Q’ again.
