Minecraft Legends Versus Mode is a competitive version of the Minecraft Legends experience. It involves teams of up to 4v4 gathering resources, cultivating armies, and building bases on the world map, while working together to destroy the enemy team’s Wellhouses. Here are some tips and tricks to get you going while playing Minecraft Legends PvP.

## Minecraft Legends PvP Tips and Tricks

- Coordinate with your team! If one of you is gathering a ton of wood and stone, ask another teammate to focus on other resources. This way, you’re better prepared to react to any situation.
- Pay attention to the piglin armies. If they’re attacking an enemy player, use that to your advantage and attack at the same time to overwhelm them.
- Always gather resources. While it’s easy to get distracted with so much going on, be sure you’re making the effort to gather resources as you roam around. 
- Counter enemy armies. If you see an enemy army made up of mostly melee units, spawn in some ranged ones to take them down from a distance. Outsmarting the enemy team is the best way to win.
- Building a forward base is a great way to keep some pressure on the enemy and see what they’re doing.
