Minecraft Legends features a ton of new ways to interact with the Minecraft world. This article provides some tips and tricks to get your journey started on the right foot.

## General Minecraft Legends Tips

- Remember to keep an eye out for resources as you travel around. You don’t even have to stop moving to gather them. Send your allays out to mine while you continue to roam.
- You’ll come across different environmental entities while exploring. Some entities help you out, such as bouncecaps that allow you to jump super high, but others, like redthorn, are hazardous. Pay attention out there!
- If you’re running out of resources, don’t forget to check out villages you’ve kept safe. They’ll almost always have a chest full of items to offer!
- The map provides all sorts of valuable information. Take a look to see what villages need rescuing, where piglin outposts are setting up, and to see which villages have resources for you.
- The songbook contains all the melodies you need to know to gather resources, build structures, spawn units, and more!
- Build mode is your secret weapon. As long as you’ve been gathering resources, you can build structures like arrow towers and other useful tools during combat.
- If you grab the ‘Cure Netherrack’ improvement, you can remove netherrack and create paths into enemy bases!
- Diversify your army. Set up spawners outside of wherever you attack, and make sure to approach battles with the right set of units. Read your journal for info on what specific units are best for.
- Protect your units! If your army is losing a battle, or if you see them falling into environmental hazards such as lava, call them back to you before they’re gone forever!
- Make sure to *remove* offensive structures you’re no longer using to get a resource refund. For example, remove a redstone launcher that can’t reach anything anymore! 
  - That said, make sure you leave defense structures – those that protect villages – as piglins might come back to attack that village.
- Destroy as many enemy structures as you can. You’ll get valuable upgrade materials!
