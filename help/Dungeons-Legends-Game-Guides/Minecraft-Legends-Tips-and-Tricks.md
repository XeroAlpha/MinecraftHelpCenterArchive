## What Kind of Game is Minecraft Legends?

Oh no! Minecraft’s Overworld is being invaded by hordes of piglins spilling out of the Nether! They’ve established bases all around the Overworld, imprisoning its inhabitants and taking over its settlements!  As the hero of Minecraft Legends, you’re tasked with uniting your friends to fight off the piglins and take back your world. 

Minecraft Legends is a third-person action strategy game. The player embodies a hero on horseback, who in turn controls an army of units made up of Minecraft mobs and directs them to fight off the invading piglins. Players can also gather resources to build defensive and offensive structures such as walls, arrow towers, and many more.

After finishing the Tutorial, you’ll have a good understanding of how to control your character and command your units. But if you’re struggling to progress or are just looking for some additional insight, we’ve got you covered.

## What are the Modes in Minecraft Legends?

The modes in Minecraft Legends are as follows:

### Campaign

Campaign mode has you rallying the mobs of the Overworld to take down the piglins! These ravenous enemies have set up bases all around the Overworld and are holding its inhabitants hostage. Free your new-found friends and take back your home! 

### Versus

Versus is Minecraft Legends’ PvP mode. Here, you’re battling other players in teams of up to 4v4. Your goal is to gather resources and build out your army and base. All the while, you’re planning out a strategy to take down the enemy base and prove your skills.

### Lost Legends and Myths

Lost Legends and Myths are two unique modes that feature standalone challenges and downloadable content (DLC). 

Lost Legends are free, monthly twists on the typical Legends formula that see you taking on challenges in new ways.

Myths are community-built mini-games that you can download from Minecraft Marketplace. We’ll have more information about these after launch.

### How Many People can Play Against Each Other in Minecraft Legends?

Minecraft Legends can support up to eight players, with four players on each team in Versus Mode. Up to four players can play co-operative campaign.

However, players on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch cannot host more than one additional player in campaign co-op or more than four players total in a 2v2 PvP match. Players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X\|S, and PC can host up to 4v4 PvP sessions and up to four players in a cooperative match.

Players on older generation hardware ***can join*** sessions hosted by players on more powerful hardware.

## General Minecraft Legends Tips

### Auto-Save Backup

Minecraft Legends keeps a few auto-save backups for every campaign save file. To access them, navigate to your campaign save of choice and press the 'Autosaves' button. Here, you can choose between five recent autosaves.

### Exploration and Navigation

- Remember to keep an eye out for resources as you travel around. You don’t even have to stop moving to gather them. Send your allays out to mine while you continue to roam.
- You’ll come across different environmental entities while exploring. Some entities help you out, such as bouncecaps that allow you to jump super high, but others, like redthorn, are hazardous. Pay attention out there!
- Be careful around cliffs! Just like in traditional Minecraft, your hero takes fall damage unless you’re under the effect of a bouncecap! 
- If you’re running out of resources, don’t forget to check out villages you’ve kept safe. They’ll almost always have a chest full of items to offer.

### Using the Map

- The map provides all sorts of valuable information. Take a look to see what villages need rescuing, where piglin outposts are setting up, and to see which villages have resources for you.
- The map also allows you to fast travel between villages, wellhouses you’ve built, and the Well of Fate! 
- The aim of the game is to take down the hordes of enemy bases spread around. Hovering over the enemy bases on the map will tell you what to prepare for.

### Songbook

- The songbook contains all the melodies you need to know to gather resources, build structures, spawn units, and more!
- Open the songbook to customize the melodies on your hotbar.
- The songbook also contains a journal of everything you’ve discovered in the Overworld for quick reference.

### Build Mode

- Build mode is your secret weapon. As long as you’ve been gathering resources, you can build structures like arrow towers and other useful tools during combat.
- Remember, you can build ramps on top of netherrack!
- If you grab the ‘Cure Netherrack’ improvement, you can remove netherrack and create paths into enemy bases!

### Combat

- **Pausing the game doesn’t pause the action! Always be sure to pause the game in a safe space away from danger.**
- Don’t forget to use your sword! While your weapon can’t damage buildings, you can use it to protect your units from certain types of baddies while they focus on enemy structures.
- Diversify your army. Set up spawners outside of wherever you attack, and make sure to approach battles with the right set of units. Read your journal for info on what specific units are best for.
- Protect your units! If your army is losing a battle, or if you see them falling into environmental hazards such as lava, call them back to you before they’re gone forever!
- If battles are too challenging, remember you can lower the difficulty level in the Settings.
- If you’re struggling with a certain base, make sure to explore a bit, gather some resources and build yourself up. Or roam around and grab creepers, skeletons, or zombies if you haven’t unlocked their spawners yet. Their homesteads are on the map. Take things on from easiest to hardest. The map will tell you how challenging a base is. 
- Make sure to *remove* offensive structures you’re no longer using to get a resource refund. For example, remove a redstone launcher that can’t reach anything anymore! 
  - That said, make sure you leave defense structures – those that protect villages – as piglins might come back to attack that village.
- Destroy as many enemy structures as you can. You’ll get valuable upgrade materials!
- Remember to look in your Songbook for additional items to place in your hotbar. There might be an upgrade or tool you missed!

### Banner View

- Banner View is a specialized top-down view where you can command specific sets of units. This is a great way to diversify your army in an intentional way. Send your melee units to attack a tower while your ranged units hold off enemies, for example.
- If you’re confused about entering Banner View, make sure to look at your preferred control scheme in the menus for more information.

### Cooperative Multiplayer

- You can resume a save at any time with up to four players. Stuck on a certain battle? Bring some friends in to help. Minecraft Legends is cross-platform, so friends on all supported devices can join in!
- Remember, the joining players are entering the host’s world. Any progress made in the world is saved to the host’s world only.
- You all share resources and improvements. Divide and conquer! Send out one teammate to gather resources while the other two stay to build up defenses, for example.

## Advanced Minecraft Legends Tips and Tricks

**Note: This section spoils enemies, scenarios, structures, and other unlockables from later in the game. If you want the game remain a surprise, we suggest you play more before reading onward. Only use these tips if you’re really struggling and need some help.**

### My Village is Being Attacked by Piglins, How do I Defend It?

Villages are constantly being attacked by piglin armies. However, there are quite a few ways to defend against them.

Remember, you can tell which villages will be attacked at night via the map. You have all day to build walls, defense towers, and traps to hold out against enemies. Also, make sure you’re defending villages that are being actively attacked at night. Static defenses can help, but nothing is as valuable as you and your army.

### I Don’t Have Enough Resources to Build Certain Structures

Build upgrades at the Improvement Hub to increase how many resources you can hold at one time. Some improvements target specific resource counts, while others are more general.

### I Don’t Have Enough Prismarine to Upgrade my Improvement Hub

If you don’t have enough prismarine to upgrade your Improvement Hub, try taking down some smaller piglin structures on the map.

### I Can’t Find the Right Resources for the Build I Want

If you’re struggling to find resources, check the map! Each biome has a resource specific to that region. Hover over a region on the map to see which resource it holds.

### How do I Spawn Creepers, Skeletons, and Zombies?

To spawn these additional creatures, you must find their respective homesteads and free them from the piglins. Once they’re freed, you unlock a spawner to create more units whenever you’d like.

### I’m Struggling With the Horde of the Spore

These enemies will spread their toxins all over the ground, making it more difficult to build structures nearby. They also love to build bases on separate, high platforms and shoot poisonous pellets down at you and your army. Ranged units are a great way to keep the pressure off while you build ramps to navigate upwards.

Also, when inside a Horde of the Spore base, healers are a great counter to the piglins’ poisonous effects. Otherwise, zombies can’t get poisoned. Use that to your advantage.

### I’m Struggling With the Horde of the Bastion

The Horde of the Bastion focuses on defense. Their bases are massive constructs with seemingly endless walls, gates, and towers. Creepers and redstone launchers are your best bet. Use your explosives to break through enemy gates from a distance and charge in with the rest of your army to win. 

### I’m Struggling With the Horde of the Hunt

The Horde of the Hunt typically builds on flat lands with little in the way of walls and gates, but spawns tons of units to swarm you and your army. Ranged units and walled defenses will help you fend off their attacks.

The Horde of the Hunt will rarely give up a chase, and they’re *fast*. Only engage when you’re ready to defend against large amounts. Hit and run attacks are the best way to take down bases.
