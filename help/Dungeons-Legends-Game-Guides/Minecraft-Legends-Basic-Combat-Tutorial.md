This article goes alongside a video tutorial for Minecraft Legends. For the best tutorial experience, please read the following text alongside [this video](https://youtu.be/kM0JSr6aKuo). 

## Using Your Sword

While your units do a great job of taking down enemies, you can help them out with your sword!

### Xbox Controller 

- Press ‘B’ to attack with your sword.
- Holding the button down will continuously swing the sword.

### Mouse and Keyboard 

- Press the left mouse button to attack with your sword.
- Holding the button down will continuously swing the sword.

## Commanding Units to Attack Enemies

While you can use your sword to attack enemies, your units are more effective in most cases.

### Xbox Controller 

- Stand near your units and press ‘X’ to rally them.
- Face a group of enemy piglins and press ‘Y’ to have your units charge!
- Your units will automatically attack enemy piglins that come near you or them.

### Mouse and Keyboard 

- Stand near your units and press ‘Q’ to rally them.
- Face a group of enemy piglins and press ‘E’ to have your units charge!
- Your units will automatically attack enemy piglins that come near you or them.  

## Commanding Units to Take Down Structures

Taking down piglin structures is an important part of taking back the Overworld! You must command your units to do so, as your sword can’t damage structures!

### Xbox Controller 

- Stand near your units and press ‘X’ to rally them. 
- Bring them near an enemy structure and press ‘Y’ to have them attack it.
- Use your sword to protect your units from enemy attacks. They can’t defend themselves while attacking structures!

### Mouse and Keyboard 

- Stand near your units and press ‘Q’ to rally them. 
- Bring them near an enemy structure and press ‘E’ to have them attack it.
- Use your sword to protect your units from enemy attacks. They can’t defend themselves while attacking structures!
