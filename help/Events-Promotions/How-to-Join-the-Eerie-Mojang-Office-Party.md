From **10am Pacific Time on December 9 to 3pm Pacific Time on December 20**, players of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition can enter a virtual recreation of our Mojang Studios in Stockholm, Sweden and play mini-games, win prizes, and explore behind the scenes of making the blockiest game in the world. See [Join our in-game event](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/eerie-mojang-office-party) for additional information.

## How to Join the Party

1.  Make sure your PC, game console, or mobile device is connected to the internet
2.  Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
3.  Click the dedicated button on the main screen in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

## How to Access Multi-Player Games

You’ll need an internet connection and account permissions for multi-player servers to take part in the event. You can find tips for troubleshooting access at [Troubleshooting Unable to Join Multiplayer Worlds in Minecraft](../Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Realms/Troubleshooting-Unable-to-Join-Multiplayer-Worlds-in-Minecraft.md). Here are some tips for joining:

- **Enable Online Subscriptions for Consoles:** You must have a subscription that includes online play on consoles, like Xbox Live Gold/Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, or Nintendo Switch Online.
- **Check Child Account Access:** To join from a child account, make sure that server play is enabled in the account’s settings; this is turned off by default. See [Set Up Microsoft Family Accounts for Minecraft Multiplayer Games](../Account-Settings/Set-Up-Microsoft-Family-Accounts-for-Minecraft-Multiplayer-Games.md) and [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md) for information.

## How to Claim Rewards

**Note:** The sticker book indicates that a Mojang Office shirt is awarded for becoming an Apprentice in the first daily challenge, but the reward is actually the Mojang Office cap that appears in your Dressing Room.

Complete one daily challenge to get a cap, three daily challenges to get a shirt, and five daily challenges to receive a cape. We can’t provide any tips or hints—that would spoil the fun. After you complete the challenges and earn your reward, items will be delivered to your Dressing Room. You'll need to restart Minecraft to see your rewards. See [How to Equip Character Creator Items and Skins in the Dressing Room in Minecraft](../Managing-Marketplace-Content/How-to-Equip-Character-Creator-Items-and-Skins-in-the-Dressing-Room-in-Minecraft.md) to learn how to locate and equip items in your Dressing Room.
