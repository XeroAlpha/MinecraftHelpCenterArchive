Redemption and usage of Minecraft Character Creator requires internet access, an up-to-date Minecraft Bedrock Edition with access to Minecraft Marketplace (available separately) (e.g., excluding Minecraft Java Edition and Playstation versions of Minecraft), and a Microsoft account in good standing.

Once your code(s) are e-mailed to you, participants must go to Minecraft.net/redeem, and must register a Microsoft account or log in to an existing one.  Note: It is no longer possible to redeem a Code using a Mojang account.  Enter the Code you received.  Once redeemed to your Microsoft account, launch the updated Minecraft Bedrock Edition with Minecraft Marketplace and sign in with the Microsoft account used to redeem the Code.  If you meet the requirements set forth above, the full Code value will be applied and may be used for eligible purchases (exclusions apply) made directly at the Minecraft Marketplace.  Proceed to the in-game Minecraft Marketplace to obtain your Character Creator or go to Minecraft.net/Marketplace to see what’s new.  Code must be redeemed by 3/29/25.  Minecraft - ESRB Rating: E 10+. Visit www.esrb.org for rating information.  Microsoft is not a Sponsor of this offer.  Please note, if you are redeeming multiple codes, you may need to repeat the redemption process for each code.  You agree that Microsoft may, freely and without liability, remove Creator items redeemed through this promotion, suspend or ban accounts, and take other disciplinary or corrective action if Microsoft suspects or believes your account is engaged in fraudulent or abusive activity.  

 

***Can I redeem more than 1 reward?***

Yes. Each participant can earn three (3) rewards. However, each participant may redeem only one of each reward: Cherry Blossom Dress, Camel Hat, or Axolotl hat.

 

***Can I earn credit(s) from submitting my receipt(s) to the WK Kellogg text short-code or WK Kellogg email address?***

No. In order to earn credit for your reward, you must upload a picture of your receipt(s) to [www.wkkelloggminecraftpromo.com](https://www.wkkelloggminecraftpromo.com/). Receipts texted or emailed will **not** earn promotion credit.
