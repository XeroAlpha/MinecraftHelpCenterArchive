Minecraft events and promotions often award capes that you can equip on your character to show your participation. After a cape is granted or you [redeem a code](../Redeeming-Gifts-Codes/How-to-Redeem-a-Code-for-In-Game-Downloadable-Content-in-Minecraft.md), it appears in the dressing room of your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition profile. Capes are often granted to Minecraft: Java Edition profiles at a later date only after participation ends.

If you want to receive your cape on your Minecraft: Java Edition profile sooner, you can try to activate it by signing into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Here’s how:

1.  Wait for notification that your cape was granted or redeem your code.
2.  Start the Minecraft Launcher.
3.  Sign into the Launcher using the Microsoft account you use to play Minecraft.
4.  Start the latest release of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
5.  Select **Dressing Room** and [locate your item in the appropriate section](../Minecraft-Marketplace-Content/How-to-Equip-Character-Creator-Items-and-Skins-in-the-Dressing-Room-in-Minecraft.md).
6.  Exit Minecraft: Bedrock Edition after you verified that your item is available in the Dressing Room.
7.  [Sign out of the Minecraft Launcher](../Account-Sign-In/How-to-Sign-Out-of-Minecraft.md) and close the application.
8.  Restart the Minecraft Launcher and sign in again with the same Microsoft account.
9.  Select **Minecraft: Java Edition** in the Launcher.
10. Select **Skins**.
11. Highlight the skin you are currently using.
12. Click **…** and select **Edit**.
13. Click your cape and select **Save & Use**.

It is important that you sign out and restart to make sure Minecraft: Java edition reconnects and finds your cape. If the process above doesn't work, you may need to wait until the official Minecraft: Java Edition cape grant after the event or promotion end date.
