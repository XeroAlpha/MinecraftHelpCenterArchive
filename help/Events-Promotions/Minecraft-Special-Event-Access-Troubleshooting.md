From time to time, Minecraft will host special events that allow players to join special-made worlds for some limited-time fun. Special Minecraft event worlds are exclusive to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If you are trying to join in using other Minecraft games like Java Edition, Dungeons, or Legends, you will not find these worlds. If you are having issues getting into the world, here are some possible solutions.

- **Sign into or link a Microsoft account:** You need to sign into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with a Microsoft account that owns Minecraft or is subscribed to Xbox Game Pass. If you're playing on a console, link your account to your Microsoft account. See these articles for more information:
