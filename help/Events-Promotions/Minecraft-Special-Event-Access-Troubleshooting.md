Minecraft occasionally hosts limited-time events exclusive to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition featuring special-made worlds. If you’ve followed those instructions and are still having issues getting into the event, here are potential solutions. Events may correspond with new builds of Minecraft. Loading your experience may take longer than usual.

## Confirm your Minecraft Edition

Special Minecraft event worlds are only available in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. You will not find them in Minecraft: Java Edition, Minecraft Dungeons, or Minecraft Legends.

## Update Minecraft Version

You need to be using the most recent version of Bedrock Edition to join limited-time events. If you're having trouble updating, see these articles for more information:

- [How to Manually Update Minecraft on Consoles](../Download-Install/Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Consoles.md)
- [How to Manually Update Minecraft on Mobile](../Download-Install/Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Mobile-Devices.md)

## Sign into or link a Microsoft account

You need to sign into Bedrock Edition with a Microsoft account that owns Minecraft or is subscribed to Xbox Game Pass. If you're playing on a console, you’ll also need to link your console account to your Microsoft account. See these articles for more information:

## Check account permissions

If you’re playing on a child account, your account needs to be able to join multiplayer games. If this is blocked, you may need a parent’s assistance with changing parental controls.  See these articles for more information:
