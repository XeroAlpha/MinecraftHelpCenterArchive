**Note:** if you are a Marketplace Pass subscriber, you can upgrade to a Realms Plus subscription without canceling your current subscription. However, we highly recommend canceling your Marketplace Pass subscription as soon as possible as all benefits of it are included in Realms Plus.

## I can’t sign up for Minecraft Marketplace Pass

You must have a Microsoft Account to trial or purchase Marketplace Pass. If you haven’t already done so, read about[ setting up your Xbox Live or Microsoft Account](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition/Set-Up-Microsoft-Family-Accounts-for-Minecraft-multiplayer-games.md).

If you are playing Minecraft through an Amazon device, you will not be able to sign up for Marketplace Pass. However, if you have signed up for the service on a different platform, you can access your Marketplace Pass content on your Amazon device.

Marketplace Pass is only available through Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, so if you are playing on Java, you will not find the service there.

If you still need help, please reach out to [Xbox support](https://beta.support.xbox.com/).   

## I can’t subscribe to Marketplace Pass on Minecraft Preview/Beta

Marketplace Pass only works in Preview/Beta after you have already subscribed through the main Minecraft game. You will need to subscribe to it through the normal live version of Minecraft and then restart Preview/Beta for it to work.

## I’m a Realms Plus subscriber

If you’re a current Realms Plus subscriber, you will be blocked from subscribing to Marketplace Pass. Marketplace Pass benefits are included in your Realms Plus subscription. To sign-up for only Marketplace Pass, you will need to [cancel your Realms Plus subscription](../Manage-Realms-Subscriptions/How-Do-I-Cancel-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-Subscription.md) and wait for the subscription period to end.
