Items downloaded using Marketplace Pass may not appear if you’re playing on a different platform from the one you used to subscribe to Marketplace Pass. Here’s how to activate your content on another platform:

1.  Start Minecraft from the platform you used to subscribe to Marketplace Pass. (For example, if you’re playing on PC but subscribed on Xbox, launch Minecraft from the Xbox).
2.  Visit **Marketplace** to verify the content you want is downloaded.
3.  Restart Minecraft on the platform where you want to access the Marketplace content. 
4.  Your subscription needs to be verified on that original device’s store every 30 days. If you plan on playing Minecraft on a different device for the long-term without returning to the original, cancel your subscription and make a new one on the new platform.
