If you own a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm, you may see improved performance by setting a server region preference. Choosing a server region near you and friends can help reduce lag.

## How to set your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm server region preference

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Play**.
2.  Select the **Realms **tab.
3.  Select your Realm and select **Settings**.
4.  Select **Manage Realm**.
5.  Select the **Advanced** tab.
6.  Select a server region preference.

If you do not set a preference, the Realm server location is automatically chosen based on the first player to join. The following options are available:

- **Automatic, first to join session:** The server will be closest to the first player to join.
- **Automatic, Realm owner connection**: The server will be closest to the owner’s location.
- **Specific Region**: The server will be hosted in the selected location.

All selections are preferences and various circumstances may result in your Realm being hosted in a different region than what you selected. In these cases, we will always attempt to put you in the next best region.
