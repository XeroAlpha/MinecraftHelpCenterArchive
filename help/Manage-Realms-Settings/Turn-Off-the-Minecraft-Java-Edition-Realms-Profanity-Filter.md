The Minecraft: Java Edition Realms profanity filter is designed to protect you or your child from harsh language. However, if you have an adult account, you can choose to turn off the profanity filter. Child accounts cannot have the filter turned off.

## How to disable the Minecraft: Java Edition Realms profanity filter

1.  [Sign in with your Microsoft Account](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login) on Minecraft.net.
2.  Select the **Account** tab on the side bar.
3.  Toggle the **Profanity Filter** to Off under the Java Realms Settings.

If the Java Edition profanity filter is grayed out, verify that you are signed into the correct Microsoft account on Minecraft.net. The profanity filter will only filter your chat in Minecraft: Java Edition. Other Realms players will see chat messages based on their personal settings.
