*If you're looking for how to transfer your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition worlds between devices, please go to* [Managing Data And Game Storage In Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/How-to-Transfer-Your-World-to-Another-Device-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md#h_01FG9YRQBDPNJ8JYNKVGXK04FX).

## Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

We're often asked if players can download Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for free after purchasing it on a different device. Unfortunately, this is not possible. This is because Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is sold and licensed separately on each platform, and transferring licenses is not possible as each platform has their own marketplace.

An example: You bought Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on a Nintendo Switch and want to transfer to an Xbox One. You would need to purchase a new copy on the Xbox One.

Deleted Minecraft: Bedrock Edition applications can be re-downloaded using the same store account and device type on which it was purchased. You can visit your device's marketplace, search for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, and re-download the app for free.

For more information on these policies, please consult your platformâ€™s marketplace support center.

## Minecraft Legends

Your Minecraft Legends **marketplace** purchases will transfer over to other devices. However, please understand that you must buy Minecraft Legends on another platform to play it. Purchasing the game on one platform does not mean you own it on another platform.
