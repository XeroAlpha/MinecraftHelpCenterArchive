## Refunds for Minecraft: Java Edition 

Contact Amazon if you bought a gift code from Amazon that you wish to refund. Or, learn more about [Amazon refunds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=901926). 

### Purchases made with Paysafecard, Multibanco, Qiwi, or Poli Card are not refundable due to technical or regional limitations.

According to the Terms and Conditions listed on [prepaid cards](https://minecraft.net/prepaid) purchased at a retail store, we are unable to offer refunds for prepaid cards. Some retailers may offer refunds or compensation, so we urge you to return the card with the receipt to the store where it was purchased. 

Different editions of Minecraft are not interchangeable. If you have accidentally bought the wrong Minecraft edition, contact the appropriate support team for your console.  As with most other downloadable software, we do not typically offer refunds for other reasons. 

If you have made your purchase from an unauthorized reseller, we cannot offer a refund. You may wish to dispute your purchase directly with the seller.    

## Refunds for Minecraft Realms 

[Minecraft Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/) is a subscription service and is not typically eligible for full or partial refunds. If we've done something that has caused you to be unable to access your Realm, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support), and we'll try to fix it. If we can't fix it, you may be eligible for a refund. For more information about Minecraft Realms refunds, please visit the [terms for Minecraft Realms](https://minecraft.net/realms/terms/).   

## Refunds for Minecoin or Token Purchases 

All purchases made using Minecoins and Tokens are final, but if an unauthorized purchase was made by someone else, you can contact the support center for the application store where the purchase was made:

- Microsoft Store - [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/) 
- Apple App Store - [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143) 
- Apple TV - [Apple TV Store](https://support.apple.com/apple-tv)

## Refunds for Minecraft Dungeons 

**Note: Any game purchases made before Mojang's switch to Microsoft services are no longer eligible for refund.**

Refunds are available if you contact Minecraft Support within **15 days **of purchase and if: 

- You made a duplicate purchase. 
- A purchase was made without your permission. 
- You're unable to play your game after visiting [minecraft.net](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us) troubleshooting sections for your version of Minecraft.  

If this is the case, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support), provide the [order number(s) and transaction ID(s](./What-is-a-Transaction-ID.md)) from the purchase, and specify which purchase to refund. **We are unable to make a refund without an order number or transaction ID, verifying that you own the account.** 

Our refund policy allows for one refund per license. If you have already been refunded for a license and repurchased the game using the same account, we are unable to provide a subsequent refund.  

**Note: Minecraft Support can only refund purchases made through minecraft.net. For other purchases, please read below. **

### If you purchased Minecraft Dungeons from another storefront  

If you purchased from the Xbox Marketplace, Microsoft Store, Nintendo eShop, or PlayStation Marketplace, you must go to that platform's support team to request a refund. Our support team is not able to refund your game purchase unless it was purchased from our site [www.minecraftdungeons.net](https://www.minecraftdungeons.net/en-us/) and played through the Minecraft Launcher.   

### If you purchased Minecraft Dungeons on the wrong account 

If you purchased Minecraft Dungeons on the wrong account, please navigate to the [Minecraft Dungeons Billing FAQ](../Minecraft-Dungeons/Support-for-Minecraft-Dungeons-Purchases.md) for more information.
