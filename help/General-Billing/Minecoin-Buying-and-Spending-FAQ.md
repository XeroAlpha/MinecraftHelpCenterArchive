## How do I purchase Minecoins?

To purchase Minecoins, you must have a payment method set up in your device. The first time you try to purchase something, you'll be asked to add a payment method if you haven't already. Otherwise, when you sign in to make your purchase, you'll be reminded which payment method you have saved.

Your payment method may vary depending on which device you're using to make a purchase. In all cases, by signing in with your Xbox Live account, you can access your Minecoins on any Minecraft: Bedrock Edition device.\*

For example, if you play on both a Windows 10 (and above) device and an iPhone and purchase Minecoins on your iPhone, you'll pay for the coins using your Apple Store account. Later, when you play on your Windows 10 (and above) device, your coins will be available along with any purchases that you made in the Minecraft Marketplace.

Then if you decide to purchase more Minecoins on your Windows 10 (and above) device, you'll pay for them using your Microsoft account and your coins and purchases will be available the next time you play on your iPhone. If you later purchase a Fire TV, everything will also appear there when you sign in with your Xbox Live account.

**Note**: **\*If you're a parent with associated child accounts that share your Xbox subscription, make sure that you make purchases with your own account, as child accounts do not provide a payment method for this. If your child has their own Xbox account that you have provided consent for and you want to purchase marketplace content for them, it will need to be purchased through their Xbox/Minecraft account.**

Prepaid cards to redeem for Minecoins may also be available from local retail stores.

## What platforms do Minecoin and Marketplace content codes work on?

Minecoins and Marketplace content are available on the following platforms:

-   Android
-   Amazon Kindle Fire
-   Amazon Fire TV
-   Chromebook
-   iOS (iPhone and iPad)
-   Nintendo Switch
-   PlayStation™ 4
-   Windows 10 and above
-   Windows 10 Mobile
-   Xbox One and Series X\|S

## What can I spend Minecoins on?

You can purchase all in-game content and add-ons using Minecoins, including Skin Packs, Character Packs, and Minecraft Worlds created by the community.

**Note: You can't use Minecoins to purchase Minecraft Realms, but you can purchase a subscription for Realms using the default payment method on your account.**

## I didn't receive the Minecoins that I purchased. What should I do?

If you purchased on your Windows 10 (and above) device:

-   Sign in at [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com/) and check your recent purchases.
-   If you see a completed purchase, restart your device as it may need to be updated.
-   If you have another device running Minecraft, sign in on that device to see if your purchase appears there.
    -   If the purchase appears, there may be a problem on your device. Make sure that you're signed in with the same account used to complete the purchase.
    -   If the purchase doesn't appear, contact [Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us).
    -   Additional Support:
        -   If you purchased from Apple Store (iPhone or iPad), go to the [iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143).
        -   If you purchased from Google Play Store (Android or Chromebook), go to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe).
        -   If you purchased from Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire TV, go to the [Amazon Store](https://www.amazon.com/Mojang-Minecraft-Pocket-Edition/dp/B00992CF6W/).

## Can Minecoins be refunded?

All Minecoin purchases are final. However, if an unauthorized purchase was made by someone else, contact store support for the device that made the purchase.

## Can I convert my Minecoins back to real currency?

No. Once you\'ve purchased Minecoins, they can't be converted back to real currency.

## Can I give Minecoins to someone as a Gift?

Minecoins are available only on the account where they were purchased. They cannot be given from one Xbox Live account to another. However, Minecoin gift cards are available at many retail outlets. You're always welcome to purchase one of these and give it to a friend.

## I tried to use Minecoins to make an in-game purchase, but something went wrong. What should I do?

The most common problem preventing an in-game purchase is that there aren't enough coins. Check the top-right corner of Microsoft Store to make sure you have enough coins to make the purchase. If not, you can click the + icon to purchase more.

If you tried to purchase more coins but you don't see them in your wallet, follow the steps in the previous section titled [I didn\'t receive the coins that I purchased. What do I do?](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9058316885133-Minecoin-Buying-and-Spending-FAQ#h_01FF8TBWEZRCYSC42KE1TTX3X2)

## I purchased the wrong Minecraft: Bedrock Edition world by mistake. Can I get a refund?

You'll need to contact store support for the device that you made your purchase on. You may get a refund depending on the circumstances. Follow the steps in the previous section titled [Can Minecoins be refunded?](https://support.xbox.com/games/game-titles/minecraft-marketplace-faq#Refund) for support.
