## Where do I Find my Transaction ID? 

There are a few ways to find your transaction ID: 

- After your purchase, check your confirmation email for the transaction ID and order number. 
- Look in your Inbox for an email sent by Mojang Studios (noreply@mojang.com) to locate your transaction ID. 
- Check your spam or junk folder if you don't see it in your Inbox. 
- If you used a gift code or PIN from a Minecraft prepaid card, that code is used to verify account ownership. 

**Note for Minecraft: Java Edition players: Only Minecraft: Java Edition purchases made before 7/25/2022 will generate a Minecraft Transaction ID which is helpful for the Minecraft account recovery process. Minecraft: Java Edition purchases made after 7/25/2022 use a Microsoft account and will not create a Transaction ID. **

**If you made a purchase after 7/25/2022, your order went through Microsoft, and will instead have an Order ID. Please reach out to Microsoft for refund assistance or an account recovery. **

## I Lost my Transaction ID 

Mojang cannot provide Transaction IDs for any reason. If you cannot find the email, you may be able to locate it using your payment method information.

**Note: Because a transaction ID is considered proof of account ownership, we do not recommend purchasing a used account from another player. Mojang Studios cannot provide support if you made your purchase through a non-authorized website, reseller, or another player.**

If you cannot locate an email or transaction ID, or if your purchase was not made by any of the following payment methods, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). 

## Payment Methods 

### PayPal 

A PayPal transaction ID is a seventeen-character alphanumeric code. However, in some cases, you may be issued a PayPal receipt number. 

- PayPal transaction ID example: 1AB23456C7890123D 
- PayPal receipt number example: 1234-5678-9012-3456 

To find your transaction ID or PayPal receipt number, log into your PayPal account and check your transaction history. 

If you no longer have access to your PayPal account, contact PayPal to request the ID. 

### Credit or Debit Card 

Purchases Made From December 2013 - Present 

All current transactions made using a Visa, MasterCard, or American Express card are handled by our payment partner Braintree. 

A Braintree transaction ID is a set of six or seven numbers and letters. 

- Braintree transaction ID example: 1a2bcd3 

If you lost your Braintree transaction ID, we can attempt to verify the purchase if you provide us with the cardholder name, date of purchase, expiration date, card type, and last four digits of the card used for alternate verification. 

**Note: We may be unable to verify your card details depending on the time of your purchase.** 

### Purchases Made From Mid-2011 to December 2013 

Credit and debit card transactions between mid-2011 to December 2013 were handled by our payment partner Skrill (formerly Moneybookers). 

A Skrill transaction ID is a set of nine or ten numbers and letters. 

- Skrill transaction ID example: 9876543210 

To retrieve a Skrill transaction ID, you must have your original purchase notification email. 

### Purchases Made Earlier Than Mid-2011 

Credit and debit card transactions made earlier than mid-2011 were handled by our previous payment partner DIBS. 

A DIBS transaction ID is a sequence of nine digits.  

- DIBS transaction ID example: 123456789  

To retrieve a DIBS transaction ID, you must have your original purchase notification email. 

### None of the Above? 

If your purchase was not made by any of the previously listed payment methods, and it was made after December 16th, 2015, it may have been processed by our payment partner Adyen. Adyen handles a range of local alternative payment methods such as Alipay and various bank transfers.   

An Ayden transaction ID is a sequence of sixteen numbers.  

- Ayden transaction ID example: 1234567891234567  

If you cannot locate an email or transaction ID, or if your purchase was not made by any of the previously listed payment methods, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). 

## Digital Gift Code 

If you made your purchase through a digital gift code, read on for more details. 

Digital gift codes can be purchased in our online store or on Amazon. They are not available for purchase anywhere else. 

Mojang Studios gift codes contain five sets of five letters and numbers. 

- Mojang Studios gift code example: A1B2C-D3E4F-G5H6I-J7K8L-M9N0P 

However, before October 2015, Mojang Studios gift codes were three sets of four characters. 

- Pre-October 2015 gift code example: B2C3-D4F6-G7H8 

To recover a gift code that you can no longer access, ask the person who gave it to you to retrieve it from [account.mojang.com](https://account.mojang.com/) in their account overview. 

**Gift codes purchased on older Minecraft accounts (pre-2012) cannot be found in the account overview.  ** 

Codes purchased on Amazon must be retrieved by [contacting Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us). 

**Note: Please refer to** [**this article**](../Minecraft-Java-Edition-Billing/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Gift-Code-Issues-FAQ.md) **for more information on Minecraft: Java Edition Gift Codes or** [**this article**](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Billing/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Gift-Code-Issues-FAQ.md) **for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition codes.** 

## Prepaid Pin 

Minecraft prepaid cards are physical cards available for purchase in select retail stores.  

A Minecraft prepaid card PIN is a ten-digit number or five sets of five letters and numbers. 

- Prepaid card ten-digit number PIN example: 123 456 7890 
- Prepaid card five sets of five letters and numbers example: A1B2C-D3E4F-G5H6I-J7K8L-M9N0P 

Once you redeem a Minecraft prepaid card, an email containing the PIN number is sent to the email address registered to your Mojang account confirming the redemption. If you cannot find this email, contact [Minecraft support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support) and we may be able to assist you without your PIN.  

For more information on redeeming a pre-paid card, please refer to [this article](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Billing/Redeeming-a-Prepaid-Card-for-Minecraft-Java-Bedrock-Edition-for-PC.md). 

## Mojang Studios Order Number 

This order number is generated for all purchases in the Mojang account system. It cannot be used to verify ownership of an account. 

## Minecraft for Windows Codes 

Minecraft Windows codes do not verify ownership of a Mojang account. Visit the Help article on [Minecraft for Windows](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-for-Windows-FAQ.md) for issues with these codes.
