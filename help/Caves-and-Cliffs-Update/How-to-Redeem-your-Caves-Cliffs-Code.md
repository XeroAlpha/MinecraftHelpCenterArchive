*This article will focus on how to redeem Mattel Action Figure codes for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Please note, **these codes are** **not redeemable for Minecraft: Java Edition or any non-Bedrock versions of Minecraft.\
***

## How do I get a code?

You can find a code inside the packaging of select Mattel Action Figures and/or via participating retailer promotional offers.

## How does the code work?

The unique code will unlock access to an in-game Character Creator item inspired by the mobs found in the Caves & Cliffs game update.  

## Do I need a Microsoft account?

Yes, we use Xbox Live with your Microsoft Account to allow your clothing item to be available on any supported platform.

## How do I redeem my code?

-   Go to aka.ms/Minecraft-CavesandCliffsRetail
-   Input your 25-digit code
-   Sign in with the Microsoft Account in which you would like to use the Character Creator item.

## Where do I find my downloadable content in-game?

Your new item will be found within the Character Creator! Once you are in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, select Dressing Room, and then **Edit** your character.

Need additional guidance? Still having trouble finding your item? See detailed instructions below on how to equip in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

[Please review our terms and conditions here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/terms/kelloggs)

## How do I equip my Character Creator item?

### To equip your item in Minecraft:

1.  Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
2.  Sign in with the Microsoft Account used to redeem the code
3.  Open the Dressing Room menu
4.  Choose the character you would like to equip the item on and select "Edit Character"
5.  From the Style menu, find the appropriate category of item you redeemed (outerwear, gloves, etc.) and equip your item!

## Do I need a special version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition to redeem the code?

You will need Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, found on Windows, Chromebook, Xbox, Switch, PlayStation, iOS, or Android, to access your redeemed content. You need to redeem the code to the specific Microsoft Account you wish the content to be tied to.

Then you will need to sign into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with that account on any supported device. You will need to ensure the game is listed as "Minecraft" for this content to work properly. For example, things that are not listed as "Minecraft" but instead listed as "*Minecraft: Xbox One Edition", "Minecraft: Switch Edition", "Minecraft: PS4 Edition", "Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition", **"Minecraft: Wii U Edition", "Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition*" will not sync with in-game items. \

## How to enable a child's account to redeem codes:

Microsoft Child Accounts for children under 9 years of age are not allowed to enter codes to receive items or DLC by design as a safety feature. To enable your child's account so you can temporarily redeem a code for the DLC on the account, please follow these steps:

-   On your phone, open the Xbox Family Settings app
-   Click on your Child's account
-   Click on Content Restrictions
-   Change the Restriction to allow material up to Age 10
    -   This will enable you to redeem 5x5 codes on your child's account
-   Still in the Xbox Family Settings app, click on Ask to Buy to disable it
    -   If a child account has Ask to Buy on, they cannot redeem some 5x5 codes
-   On your computer, go to xbox.com and log in via your child's account
-   Go to xbox.com/redeemcode
-   Enter the 5x5 code as written and click on redeem. Follow all prompts to fully redeem the code.

You have now redeemed the code on your child's account.

**IMPORTANT: In order to reset your child's account settings to prevent any redemptions of codes in the future, please follow the following steps:**

-   On your phone, open the Xbox Family Settings app
-   Click on your Child's account
-   Click on Content Restrictions
-   Change the Restriction to allow material up to Age 9
    -   Accounts of Age 9 and below cannot redeem 5x5 codes
-   Still in the Xbox Family Settings app, click on **Require Approval for Every Purchase** to enable it
    -   If a child account has **Require Approval for Every Purchase** off, they cannot redeem some 5x5 codes

If you wish to do this process through the [Microsoft Account Manage](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/family-online-safety/online-safety/manage-online-safety-and-privacy-settings-xbox-one) webpage you can do so. However, in our experience, this process is done faster using the app.
