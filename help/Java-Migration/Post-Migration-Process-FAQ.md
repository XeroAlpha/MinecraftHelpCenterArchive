As detailed in previous [Help Site](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/15690553323789) and [Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/account-migration-last-call) articles, the deadline to migrate your Mojang account has passed.

This article details everything you need to know about the post-migration process.

## I missed my chance to migrate. What now?

While you’ve missed the chance to migrate your Mojang account, we still want you to enjoy Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition. Through the following process, we’re providing you with one more chance to play.

While you won’t be able to keep your skins, progress, or Java profile name, you can complete the following post-migration process before **December 18, 2023** to experience Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC with a Microsoft account:

1.  Log-in with your Mojang account email address [here](https://minecraft.net/login).
2.  Click on the 'verify Mojang account email address' button.
    - Enter your Mojang account email address. Next, click ‘Get Code’ and a code will be sent to your Mojang email.
    - Enter the code.
3.  Enter a Microsoft account email address.
    - This email address can be from a new or existing Microsoft account that you own.
    - Click ‘Submit Request’.
4.  Check the box next to ‘I understand that my Mojang account will be deactivated’.
    - Double-check that the Microsoft account email displayed is correct.
5.  Click ‘Finish’.
6.  Receive an email confirming that we’ve granted your Microsoft account an entitlement to Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
7.  Download the free Minecraft Launcher through either Minecraft.net or the Microsoft Store. [This article](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/Minecraft-Launcher-for-Windows.md#do-i-need-the-minecraft-launcher-for-windows-to-play-minecraft-bedrock-edition-minecraft-java-edition-minecraft-dungeons-or-minecraft-legends) provides more details on how to download the Launcher. 
8.  Log into your Microsoft account through the Launcher and check that you have access to both Java and Bedrock.

**Note: Child accounts will need assistance from their parent accounts to complete this process.**

As migration is now over, Minecraft Support will no longer assist with any migration related tickets.

### What do I do if I haven't received my email confirmation code?

If you’ve requested a code to your Mojang account email address, but still haven’t received your verification code, please wait up to 10 minutes and check your spam/trash folders. If you haven't received your code after 10 minutes, please go back to step two and click 'get code’.

### Can I complete the post-migration process with a Microsoft account that already owns Minecraft: Bedrock Edition or Minecraft: Java Edition?

You cannot complete the post-migration process with a Microsoft account that already owns either Bedrock or Java Edition.

**Note: In rare cases, you might be able to complete the post-migration process with a Microsoft account that already owns one version of Minecraft.**

## Additional Post-Migration Questions

Please read on to address any additional questions you may have.

### Why did users need to migrate?

As detailed in our [Java migration FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Account-MIgration-FAQ), players need to migrate to a Microsoft Account to enjoy increased account security and new safety features while playing Minecraft.

### What happened to my capes, skins, username, and other content?

Any capes, skins, and other content tied to your Mojang account will be deleted. Usernames will not be released until a later date.

**Note: If you choose not to go through the post migration process, your account will be deleted along with your personal information at a later date. If you would like to request immediate deletion of your personal information, please contact** [**Minecraft Support**](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/request/new?ticket_form_id=360001225811)**.**

**Additional note: We will need you to verify ownership of your account before deleting your personal information.**

### What about my Java worlds?

Your single-player Java worlds are stored on your hard drive and should be accessible with your new version of the game. However, any pets will not respond to your character, and you will have to re-tame them.

Because you have a new Microsoft account, multiplayer worlds are a different story. You will be joining these worlds as a new player, spawning in at the world’s default spawn point with no items. However, if you have a base with items in it, you can head there to regain your items and resume play.

**Note: You will need to be re-added to any server allowlists on your new account.**

### What do I gain from going through the post-migration process?

The post-migration process provides you a new license for Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PC on a Microsoft account of your choice.

Whether or not you choose to continue the Minecraft journey with us, we appreciate the time you spent in our game before the migration period ended.
