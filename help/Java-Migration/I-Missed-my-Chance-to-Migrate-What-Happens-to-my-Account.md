**As of December 18, 2023, the post-migration process for Mojang accounts has officially ended. If you successfully completed the post-migration process, you should now have access to both Java and Bedrock editions.**

**As the migration period has concluded, Minecraft Support will no longer assist with migration-related queries. Visit [this link to learn about making a new Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/how-to-create-a-new-microsoft-account-a84675c3-3e9e-17cf-2911-3d56b15c0aaf).**

If you’ve missed your chance to migrate, you might have a few questions regarding what happens to your Minecraft: Java Edition account.

## What happens to my Java Edition account?

You no longer have access to your Java Edition account or Minecraft: Java Edition. To continue playing Minecraft, you will have to [buy Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/I-Own-Minecraft-Java-or-Bedrock-Edition-for-PC-How-Do-I-Get-the-Other.md) using a Microsoft account.

## What happens to my worlds?

Your single-player Java worlds are stored on your hard drive, but you will not be able to play on them until you buy Minecraft: Java Edition using a Microsoft account.

Because you have a new Microsoft account, multiplayer worlds are a different story. You will be joining these worlds as a new player, spawning in at the world’s default spawn point with no items. However, if you have a base with items in it, you can head there to regain your items and resume play.

**Note: New accounts will need to be re-added to any server allowlists.**

## What about my capes, skins and username?

Your capes and skins were tied to your previous Java Edition account and are not recoverable. Usernames will not be released until a later date.
