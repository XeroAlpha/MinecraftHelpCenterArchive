If you've missed your chance to migrate, you might have a few questions regarding what happens to your Minecraft: Java Edition account. Please read on for more information.

## What happens to my Java Edition account?

You no longer have access to your Java Edition account or Minecraft: Java Edition. To continue playing Minecraft, you will have to [buy Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/6657208607501) using a Microsoft account or successfully go through the post-migration process.

## What happens to my worlds?

Your single-player Java worlds are stored on your hard drive, but you will not be able to play on them until you go through the post-migration process or buy Minecraft: Java Edition using a Microsoft account.

Once you go through the post-migration process, your worlds should be accessible with your new version of the game. However, any pets will not respond to your character, and you will have to re-tame them.

Because you have a new Microsoft account, multiplayer worlds are a different story. You will be joining these worlds as a new player, spawning in at the world's default spawn point with no items. However, if you have a base with items in it, you can head there to regain your items and resume play.

**Note: New accounts will need to be re-added to any server allowlists.**

## What about my capes, skins and username?

Your capes and skins were tied to your previous Java Edition account and are not recoverable. Usernames will not be released until a later date.
