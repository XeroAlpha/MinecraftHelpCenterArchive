The Creeper Error Code occurs when you use a Microsoft account to play Minecraft and the game is having trouble signing you into our authentication servers due to a poor internet connection.

- **Restart and try again:** Network errors can be intermittent, and you may simply need to restart Minecraft and wait for background processes to complete.
- **Check your internet connection:** See [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md) for suggestions.
- **Sign out and sign back in:** See [Reset Your Microsoft Account Sign-In in Minecraft](../Account-Sign-in/Reset-Your-Microsoft-Account-Sign-in-in-Minecraft.md) for information about resetting your Microsoft account sign-in on your gaming system.

See [Use or Link Microsoft Accounts](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/29296773863181) or [Accounts Required to Play Minecraft](../Set-Up-Your-Account/Accounts-Required-to-Play-Minecraft.md) for more information about using a Microsoft account to play Minecraft.
