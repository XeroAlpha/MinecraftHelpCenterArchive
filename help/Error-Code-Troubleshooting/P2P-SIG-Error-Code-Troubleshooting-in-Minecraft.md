Minecraft is best played with friends, so when an error appears when trying to join them, we want to get you connected as soon as possible. The following is a possible error code you may get when trying to join a friendâ€™s world:

**Unable to connect, please restart your client.**

**P2P/SIG: no_session(0x80004005)**

Here are some tips to get things working again.

- **Check your version of Minecraft**: Make sure you and your friend are playing the most recent version of Minecraft.
  - See the following articles for updating Minecraft:

- **Check your internet connection**: You may still be able to play Minecraft even if your internet connection is unstable. Here are some resources for connection troubleshooting:
