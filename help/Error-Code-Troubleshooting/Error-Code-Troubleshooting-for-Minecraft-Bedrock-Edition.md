## Troubleshooting steps for Minecraft error codes

Before troubleshooting, we recommend backing up your Minecraft files. See our [Backup & Restore](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125) Help section.

- **Sign out and restart**: [Reset Your Microsoft Account Sign-in in Minecraft](../Account-Sign-in/Reset-Your-Microsoft-Account-Sign-in-in-Minecraft.md) and then shut down and restart your game system before restarting Minecraft and signing in again. If you’re playing on a Windows computer, you can also sign out of Microsoft store, the Xbox app, and any other Minecraft services that might be running and close those programs.
- **Close other programs**: Close any active, non-Minecraft apps or programs that may be using memory and processor resources.
- **Check your internet connection**: See [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md) for suggestions. If you’re trying to connect to a Realm, see [Troubleshoot Minecraft Realms Connection Errors](../Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Realms/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Realms-Connection-Errors.md).
- **Disable Add-Ons**: Minecraft modifications can cause errors; see [Disabling Minecraft Add-Ons](../Marketplace-Troubleshooting/Disable-Minecraft-Add-Ons-to-Solve-Game-Issues.md).
- **Check available storage space**: Confirm your file storage space and memory meet or exceed minimum requirements and free up space if you are low.
- **Check your edition and version of Minecraft**: You must share the same edition and version of Minecraft as your friend or the server you want to join. Update Minecraft, restart your device, and try again.

- **Run the Xbox Gaming Services Repair tool (Windows only)**: See the [Gaming Services Repair Tool for PC page](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/troubleshooting/gaming-services-repair-tool). This tool can fix issues with Minecraft or the Minecraft Launcher.
- **Verify minimum requirements (Windows only)**: Verify your system meets minimum system requirements to play Minecraft. [Visit Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc?tabs=%7B%22details%22%3A1%7D#accordionv1-b6c8df09da-item-7739893325:~:text=Windows%2010%20system%20requirements) and select Compare Features to see the latest.
- **Check for service outages**: Temporary service outages are announced on the [PlayFab](https://status.playfab.com/) and/or [Xbox Live](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status) status pages. Once an outage is resolved, you should be able to play again.
- **Uninstall and reinstall**: If other tips aren’t working, you can always start with a fresh installation of Minecraft. Make sure that you [back up your Worlds and save data](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125) first.
