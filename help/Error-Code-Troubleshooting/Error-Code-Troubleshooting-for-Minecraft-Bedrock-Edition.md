## Troubleshooting steps for Minecraft error codes

Before troubleshooting, we recommend backing up your Minecraft files. See our [Backup & Restore](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125) Help section.

- **Sign out and restart**: [Reset Your Microsoft Account Sign-in in Minecraft](../Account-Sign-in/Reset-Your-Microsoft-Account-Sign-in-in-Minecraft.md) and then shut down and restart your game system before restarting Minecraft and signing in again. If you’re playing on a Windows computer, you can also sign out of Microsoft store, the Xbox app, and any other Minecraft services that might be running and close those programs.
- **Close other programs**: Close any active, non-Minecraft apps or programs that may be using memory and processor resources.
- **Check your internet connection**: See [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md) for suggestions. If you’re trying to connect to a Realm, see [Troubleshoot Minecraft Realms Connection Errors](../Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Realms/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Realms-Connection-Errors.md).
- **Disable Add-Ons**: Minecraft modifications can cause errors; see [Disabling Minecraft Add-Ons](../Marketplace-Troubleshooting/Disable-Minecraft-Add-Ons-to-Solve-Game-Issues.md).
- **Check available storage space**: Confirm your file storage space and memory meet or exceed minimum requirements and free up space if you are low.
- **Check your edition and version of Minecraft**: Make sure you and your friend are playing the same edition and version of Minecraft (Minecraft is not compatible across editions). See the following articles for updating Minecraft. After updating, restart your device and try again.

  - [How to Manually Update Minecraft on Windows](../Download-Install/Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Windows.md)
  - [How to Manually Update Minecraft on Mobile](../Download-Install/Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Mobile-Devices.md) 
- **Adjust your video settings**: See [Optimizing Video Settings and Performance in Minecraft](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Optimizing-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Video-Settings-and-Performance.md) for tips to optimize game performance.
- **Run the Xbox Gaming Services Repair tool (Windows only)**: See the [Gaming Services Repair Tool for PC page](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/troubleshooting/gaming-services-repair-tool). This tool can fix issues with Minecraft or the Minecraft Launcher.
- **Verify minimum requirements (Windows only)**: Verify your system meets minimum system requirements to play Minecraft. [Visit Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc?tabs=%7B%22details%22%3A1%7D#accordionv1-b6c8df09da-item-7739893325:~:text=Windows%2010%20system%20requirements) and select Compare Features to see the latest.
- **Check for service outages**: Temporary service outages are announced on the [PlayFab](https://status.playfab.com/) and/or [Xbox Live](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status) status pages. Once an outage is resolved, you should be able to play again.
- **Uninstall and reinstall**: If other tips aren’t working, you can always start with a fresh installation of Minecraft. Make sure that you [back up your Worlds and save data](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125) first.
