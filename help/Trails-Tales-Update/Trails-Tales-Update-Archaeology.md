Get ready to dig even deeper into the world of Minecraft! Archaeology brings with new blocks to discover, as well as a new tool, the brush, that allows you to extract what’s hiding within. Read on for more details.

## What is Archeology in Minecraft?

Archeology is the act of digging up exciting treasures to further customize your Minecraft world.

## How Does Archeology in Minecraft Work?

To start, you’re going to want a brush.

### Brush

The brush is a new Minecraft tool. Use it to brush blocks of suspicious sand or gravel while exploring.

You can craft a brush with a feather, a copper ingot, and a stick.

### Suspicious Sand and Gravel

Suspicious sand and suspicious gravel are new block types that contain random objects like pottery sherds (yes, sherds!) You’ll need to brush these items with the brush tool to uncover what hides within.

These blocks are only in specific areas and biomes. For example, you’re likely to find suspicious sand in a desert pyramid.

We’re also introducing a new location, the trail ruins, that contain both suspicious sand and gravel. These structures can be found jungles, taiga biomes, and a few other places.

## What can I find with Archeology in Minecraft?

Depending on the biome, you can find all sorts of random items while brushing blocks. For example, brushing in the desert might uncover TNT or emeralds, while brushing in an ocean ruin may provide the new sniffer egg.

However, no matter where you brush, you can uncover pottery sherds to craft decorated pots!

### What are Decorated Pots?

Decorated pots are craftable decorative items with various symbols on its side. You can change which symbol the pot shows based on which pottery sherds you use to craft it.

If you break a pot with your hand or with the silk touch enchantment, it will drop as itself. However, breaking it with a tool that doesn’t have silk touch will drop the materials you used to craft that pot.

### What Types of Pottery Sherds are There?

The following 20 sherds and motifs can be found in different archaeological sites. Here’s what icons they’ll show:​

- Archer pottery sherd - bow with arrow​
- Burn pottery sherds - fire​
- Skull pottery sherd - skull​
- Howl pottery sherd - wolf facing sideways​
