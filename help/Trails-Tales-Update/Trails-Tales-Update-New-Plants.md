The Trails & Tales Update brings with a few new plants to grow and interact with! Read on for more details.

## The Torchflower

The torchflower seed can be used to breed and tempt sniffers, and must be planted on farmland to grow into its flower form.

Once fully grown, the torchflower can be harvested, replanted, and even used for dye!

## Pitcher Plant

The pitcher plant begins as a seed pod, and you can plant it on farmland to watch it grow through a few different stages. Or, you can use the pod to feed chickens and parrots.

Once fully grown, you can harvest the pitcher and place it as you would a normal Minecraft flower!

There’s much more to discover with these new plants and Minecraft’s new Trails & Tales Update as a whole! Check out some of our other articles for more details, or keep playing the game to uncover more secrets!
