Prepare for an exciting new material set. The bamboo set brings you new materials for building structures, and even a raft for exploring the seas.

## What is Bamboo?

Bamboo is both a decorative and a functional wood type within Minecraft! You can use it to provide your house with a neat trim, or craft with it to create the mosaic block for flooring.

## What Can I Make With the Bamboo Wood Set?

The following new bamboo items have been added to Minecraft:

- Block of bamboo​
  - Green in color (same color as grown bamboo)​
  - Rendered and placed directionally like a log​
- Block of stripped bamboo​
  - Rendered and placed directionally like a log​
- Bamboo button​
- Bamboo door​
- Bamboo fence​
- Bamboo fence gate​
- Bamboo planks​
- Bamboo pressure plate​
- Bamboo sign​
- Bamboo hanging sign​
- Bamboo slab​
- Bamboo stairs​
- Bamboo trapdoor​
- Bamboo mosaic​
  - These blocks can be used as fuel in furnace like their normal bamboo counterparts but cannot be used in recipes as a generic wood type. For example, bamboo mosaic slabs cannot be used to craft a chiseled bookshelf.​
- Bamboo mosaic stairs​
- Bamboo mosaic slab

## How Do I Make Bamboo?

Just like with other wood types, you can find bamboo around the Overworld! Cut it down with your axe and discover the various ways to interact with it!

## Can I Use Bamboo Like Other Wood Types?

Yes! Just like with oak wood or various other wood, you can use four bamboo planks to make a crafting table or insert bamboo blocks into the fence recipe for a bamboo fence.

There’s much more to discover with bamboo and Minecraft’s new Trails & Tales Update as a whole! Check out some of our other articles for more details, or keep playing the game to uncover more secrets!
