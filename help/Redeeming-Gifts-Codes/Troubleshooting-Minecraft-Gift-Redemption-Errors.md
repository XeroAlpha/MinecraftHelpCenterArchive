If you received the gift of Minecraft or Minecraft content via a gift card or a gift code via email, this page can help if you encounter a problem redeeming your code. You can redeem codes at [Minecraft.net/redeem](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem).

- **Verify region:** Minecraft gift cards must be redeemed in the region in which they were purchased. If the person redeeming a gift card lives outside the country of purchase, it will not work.
- **Reenter code**: Check for typos to make sure you entered all information accurately and as it appears on your gift card.
- **Verify purchase activation**: If the gift code is on a gift card, return it to the store where it was purchased from and ask their customer service to activate the card.
- **Reload or try another browser**: Redemption errors can be caused by saved browser data. Clear your browsing data or try another browser.
- **Try again later**: On rare occasions, a system outage can cause redemption errors. You can wait and try redemption at another time.
- **Check other Microsoft accounts**: If you get an error that your card or code has already been redeemed, it’s a good idea to check if you have already redeemed your code on a different Microsoft account. View your [Microsoft store order history](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/view-your-microsoft-store-order-history-aafefe88-3ec2-ce28-e0b6-eff1d5cc8170).
- **Verify gift card edition**: Minecraft Java and Bedrock editions are now sold as a bundle. If the gift card you want to redeem is specifically for *Minecraft: Java Edition only* and your code isn't working in the Microsoft store, [contact Minecraft Player Care](https://aka.ms/java-code-redeem-redirect).
