3.   Enter your code into the **Redeem Code** field and press **Redeem**.
4.  Sign in to your existing Microsoft account that you intend to play on, or [create a new one](../Resources-for-Families/Set-Up-Microsoft-Family-Groups-for-Parental-Controls-in-Minecraft.md).
5.  Visit the [Minecraft Legends Launcher page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/legends-standard-edition), select the version you own, and click **Download Launcher**. Place the file anywhere you'd like, then run the program to install it.
6.  Run Minecraft Launcher, select Minecraft Legends, then sign into the game with your Microsoft account.

**Note: If you purchased the physical deluxe edition of Minecraft Legends, you’ll notice that there is a physical code within the box for the ‘Carrot Commander Skin Pack.’ Please make sure you attempt to redeem this code before contacting Minecraft Support.**
