*This article applies only to Minecraft Dungeons pre-paid cards and gift codes. For information about redeeming other Minecraft gift codes, see* [How to Redeem Minecraft as a Gift](./How-to-Redeem-Minecraft-as-a-Gift.md).

The steps in this article cover redeeming a Minecraft Dungeons pre-paid card purchased in a store for the Windows version of the game. If you have purchased a Minecraft Dungeons gift code for another platform, see the list below:
