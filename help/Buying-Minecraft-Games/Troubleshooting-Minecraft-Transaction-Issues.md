If you are trying to buy Minecraft for Windows, MacOS, or Linux from the Microsoft store and get an error, try the suggestions below:

- **Try a new browser**. Clear your browsing data or try your purchase on another web browser or device. Also update your browser is the most current version.
- **Try a different payment method**. Valid payment methods may vary depending on your country or region. Check with your bank to make sure online transactions are allowed in your region.
- **Try a prepaid Minecraft card**. You may be able to buy a Minecraft prepaid card from a retail store and use this as your payment method. You can redeem your card in the Microsoft store before buying Minecraft on your [Microsoft Account page](https://redeem.microsoft.com/).

## Duplicate Charges

There are a couple of situations where a second charge may appear or seem to appear after a purchase. Seeing two similar transactions does not necessarily mean you were charged twice:

- **Verify only one Transaction ID** - An order number may be generated when a payment fails, which can be confused with a successful purchase. Only one [transaction ID](./Locating-Your-Minecraft-Transaction-ID-for-Account-Support.md) is generated with a successful purchase. Look for more than one unique transaction ID to confirm a duplicate purchase. If you were charged twice, [contact the store](./Minecraft-Refund-Policy.md) you used to make the purchase for a refund.
- **Check for a bank hold** - A bank or payment partner may temporarily reserve the purchase amount on your account, this can be confused with a second charge. The hold is usually resolved within 24-48 hours. Contact your bank or the payment partner for further information.

If you believe that you have identified a duplicate charge, contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/browse) and provide us with the transaction IDs from both charges. We will be happy to assist so you can continue to game on!

## Failed Transactions

Occasionally there is an issue where a failed transaction sends a customer to the payment confirmation screen. If you have not received an email from us confirming a successful purchase containing a [transaction ID](./Locating-Your-Minecraft-Transaction-ID-for-Account-Support.md), it is unlikely that the transaction was successful. Double-check your payment account to verify that you were charged.

## Transaction Authorization Errors

If you've received a call from your credit card company asking if you would like to authorize an international transaction, they may have interrupted the payment process, even if they eventually let the transaction go through. First verify that your credit card was charged; it is possible that the hold caused us not to be notified of the purchase. If not, you can wait for a charge to process or try your purchase again. If you were charged, [contact Microsoft Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/browse) and provide your [transaction ID](./Locating-Your-Minecraft-Transaction-ID-for-Account-Support.md).
