## REQUEST A REFUND FROM THE MICROSOFT STORE

1.  Visit your [Microsoft order history](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders) and sign in using your Microsoft account.
2.  Click the **Request a Return** option next to any item you wish to return. Only items eligible for return will display this option.

After your refund is processed, you will lose access to the returned product.

## REFUNDS FOR MINECRAFT REALMS

[Minecraft Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/) is a subscription service and is not typically eligible for full or partial refunds. If we've done something that has caused you to be unable to access your Realm, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support), and we'll try to fix it. If we can't fix it, you may be eligible for a refund. For more information about Minecraft Realms refunds, please visit the [terms for Minecraft Realms](https://minecraft.net/realms/terms/).
