Here are some suggestions to help you fix issues joining multiplayer worlds in Minecraft.

- **Update your game version:** You may encounter problems connecting to multiplayer games if all players aren’t playing the most recent version of Minecraft. Check the settings on your game platform to make sure you’re receiving automatic updates. If you use the Launcher, select “Latest release” when you start the game. See our [Download & Install](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166490706957) help section for information about manually updating Minecraft. If you do apply an update, make sure to restart your device and game.
- **Check child account permissions:** If using a child account, visit [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md) to make sure the child account's permissions are set up correctly.
- **Contact the game host:** The player hosting the game must be online and actively running a world with permissions set to allow multiplayer games. Refer to [How to Invite Friends to Your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition World](../Multiplayer-Support/How-to-Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-World.md) for more information.
- **Check for network connection errors: **See [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors ](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md)for various internet connection troubleshooting tips.
- **Check subscription status:** If you are playing Minecraft multiplayer on a console, you must be subscribed to either [Xbox Game Pass Core](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass), [Nintendo Switch Online](https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/), or [PlayStation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/) to be able to play with friends.
