When trying to join multiplayer worlds in Minecraft you may encounter a **Multiplayer is disabled** error or otherwise be unable to connect. Here are some suggestions to troubleshoot Minecraft multiplayer issues.

## Update your game version

You may encounter problems connecting to multiplayer games if all players aren’t updated to the most recent version of Minecraft.

- **Enable automatic updates**: Check your game platform settings to ensure you have the latest version.
- **Select Latest release from the launcher**: Make sure you’re not using Latest preview or Latest snapshot.
- **Manually update your game**: See these articles for additional help:
  - [How to Manually Update Minecraft on Mobile](../Download-Install/How-to-Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Mobile.md)
  - [How to Manually Update Minecraft on Consoles](../Download-Install/How-to-Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Consoles.md)
  - [How to Manually Update Minecraft on Windows](../Download-Install/How-to-Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Windows.md)

## Check account permissions and subscriptions

- **Enable multiplayer settings**: [Visit Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md) for more instructions. These steps may apply even if you don’t have a child account.
- **Verify platform subscription**: If you’re playing Minecraft multiplayer on a console, you must be subscribed to [Xbox Game Pass Core](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass), [Nintendo Switch Online](https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/), or [PlayStation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/) to play with friends.

## Check your network connection

- **Disable custom DNS and open ports**: Even if you have general Internet access, Minecraft may conflict with specific DNS and port configurations. See [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md) for details.
- **Contact the game host**: If you’re playing with a friend on a local network (LAN) or personally hosted server, the host must be online and actively running the world with the Allow multiplayer games permission enabled. See [How to Invite Friends to Your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition World](../Multiplayer-Support/Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-World.md) for more information.\*
