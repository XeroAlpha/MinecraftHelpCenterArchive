It is always smart to keep a backup of your worlds so you can revert unwanted changes or restore corrupted files. Here is how to find and restore your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm backups.

## How to download or restore a Realms world from a backup

To access the automatic Realms Backups, do the following:

1.  Click theâ€¯**Manage Realm** button next to your Realm.
2.  Select the world slot you want to use and click **Edit World**.
3.  Select **Backups** on the left.
4.  Select one of the available backups on the right to revert that world to that former state.
5.  Click the download button to the right.

To learn which versions of your world are saved automatically, see [How Mojang Saves Backups of Your Minecraft Realm](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/MinecraftPlayerCare/EeazezKFwwlOmAzI8gOfsREBMnRkTy049nNe0MS3kjj27A?e=EM6uka).

To change the world on your Realm, see [How to Upload Worlds onto a Minecraft Realm](../Manage-Realms-Settings-Worlds/How-to-Upload-Worlds-onto-a-Minecraft-Realm.md).
