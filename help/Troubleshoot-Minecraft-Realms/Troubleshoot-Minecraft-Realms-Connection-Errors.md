If you are having problems getting your Minecraft Realm to connect, here are some basic troubleshooting tips that may help:

- Realms is not supported on some older versions of the game. We recommend updating to the latest Minecraft version.
- Realms is also not supported on some older operating systems and devices. See [Upcoming OS Sunset Announcements in Minecraft](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Upcoming-OS-Sunset-Announcements-in-Minecraft.md) for more info.
- Ensure your Realms subscription is active and your payment method is up to date. See [Manage Realms Subscriptions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/26104341937421) for any help in that area.
- Close the realm and reopen it.
  - On Bedrock:
    1.  Open Minecraft.
    2.  Select **Play**.
    3.  Select the **Edit Realm** button (box with a checkmark in it) button next to your Realm.
    4.  Select **Manage Realm**.
    5.  Select **Subscription**.
    6.  Select **Close Realm**.
    7.  Re-open it.
  - On Java:
    1.  Open Minecraft.
    2.  Select **Minecraft Realms**.
    3.  Click your Realm.
    4.  Select **Configure**.
    5.  Select **Settings**.
    6.  Select **Close Realm**.
    7.  Go back in and open it after.
- If you are a member in a Realm owned by a different player, check with them to ensure their Realms subscription is active and the Realm is open.
