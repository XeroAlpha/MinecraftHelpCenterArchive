If you are unable to join or connect to a Minecraft Realm, verify that the Realm is active, your device is supported, and you have the necessary subscriptions for online play. Try these troubleshooting steps:

- **Sign out and restart**: [Reset Your Microsoft Account Sign-in in Minecraft](../Account-Sign-in/Reset-Your-Microsoft-Account-Sign-in-in-Minecraft.md) and then shut down and restart your game system before restarting Minecraft and signing in again. If you’re playing on a Windows computer, you can also sign out of Microsoft store, the Xbox app, and any other Minecraft services that might be running and close those programs.
- **Update to the latest Minecraft version:** Realms is not supported on some older versions of Minecraft. See our [Download & Install section](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166490706957) for help manually updating your version of Minecraft.
- **Verify your device is supported:** Realms is not supported on all devices and platforms. See [Upcoming OS Sunset Announcements in Minecraft](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Operating-System-Sunset-Announcements-for-Minecraft.md).
- **Verify your online service subscription (console only):** An active [Xbox Game Pass Core](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass), [Nintendo Switch Online](https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/), or [PlayStation Plus subscription](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/) is required for online play. Game platform service outages or lapsed subscriptions can affect your ability to connect to Minecraft.
- **Check the Realms subscription:** The Realm owner needs to have an active Realms subscription. See our [Manage Realms Subscriptions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/26104341937421) section for information.
- **Contact the Realm owner:** If you’re joining someone’s Realm, confirm with them that their Realms subscription is active and their Realm is open.
- **Close and reopen the Realm:** If you’re the Realm owner, resetting your Realm can solve connection problems. See [Close and Reopen Your Minecraft Realm to Solve Connection Errors](./Close-and-Reopen-Your-Minecraft-Realm-to-Solve-Connection-Errors.md)
