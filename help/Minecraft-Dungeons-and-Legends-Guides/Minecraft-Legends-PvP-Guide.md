## How to Start PvP in Minecraft Legends

Follow these steps to start PvP in Minecraft Legends:

- Launch Minecraft Legends
- Navigate to the ‘Versus Mode’ tile
- Choose either ‘Host Game’ or ‘Join Game’
  - Join Game instructions
    - Select 'Public Game' to matchmake into a lobby, or join one of your friends with an active lobby.
  - Host Game instructions
    - If you’re choosing to Host a game, select either the Public or Private tile.
    - The public tile will make your game open to all players, including those searching for matches via matchmaking.
      - From here, invite any friends you’d like to join, then click the ‘Find Players’ button to fill out the rest of the game.
      - Once everyone is in and ready, click ‘Start Game.’
    - The private tile will ensure only players you invite can join the game.

## Minecraft Legends PvP Tips and Tricks

- Coordinate with your team! If one of you is gathering a ton of wood and stone, ask another teammate to focus on other resources. This way, you’re better prepared to react to any situation.
- Pay attention to the piglin armies. If they’re attacking an enemy player, use that to your advantage and attack at the same time to overwhelm them.
- Always gather resources. While it’s easy to get distracted with so much going on, be sure you’re making the effort to gather resources as you roam around. 
- Counter enemy armies. If you see an enemy army made up of mostly melee units, spawn in some ranged ones to take them down from a distance. Outsmarting the enemy team is the best way to win.
- Building a forward base is a great way to keep some pressure on the enemy and see what they’re doing.
