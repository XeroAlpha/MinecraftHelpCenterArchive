## This article goes alongside a video tutorial for Minecraft Legends. For the best tutorial experience, please read the following text alongside **[this video](https://youtu.be/3AOPNVBCkFg)**. 

## Repairing Villages

After a village attack, some of the structures, such as the fountain, will have taken damage. It’s important to repair these structures to keep the villagers happy and safe!

### Xbox Controller 

- Navigate to the Player Building hotbar with the ‘Left’ d-pad button.
- Scroll to the **carpenter** **hut** with the right and left bumpers. 
- With your knowledge of Build view from the previous tutorials, place the carpenter hut next to any damaged structures. In this case, the fountain in the village center.
- The carpenter hut will slowly repair structures over time. You can also use it out in the field to repair all types of structures.

### Mouse and Keyboard 

- Navigate to the Player Building hotbar with the ‘C’ key.
- Scroll to the **carpenter** **hut** with the mouse wheel. 
- With your knowledge of Build view from the previous tutorials, place the carpenter hut next to any damaged structures. In this case, the Fountain in the village center.
- The carpenter hut will slowly repair structures over time. You can also use it out in the field to repair all types of structures.

## Defending Villages

You’re now tasked with defending another village. The previous village already had its fountain destroyed, so you had to clear the piglins and repair it. This second village has its fountain at 100%, and you must fend off the piglins *before* the fountain health hits 0%! Use your previously learned battle knowledge here!

## Village Chest

After successfully defending a village, the villagers will reward you with resources through their village chest.

### Xbox Controller 

- Navigate to the village chest under the village fountain.
- Walk up to it and hold ‘X’ to open it and earn your resource reward!
- Resource chests fill up over time, so don’t forget to come back after a while when you’re running low!

### Mouse and Keyboard 

- Navigate to the village chest under the village fountain.
- Walk up to it and hold ‘Q’ to open it and earn your resource reward!
- Resource chests fill up over time, so don’t forget to come back after a while when you’re running low!

## Building Village Defenses

Now that the village is safe from immediate danger, it’s time to plan ahead. You can build walls, arrow towers, and a gate to protect the villages while you’re away. 

### Xbox Controller 

- Navigate to the Player Building hotbar by pressing ‘Left’ on the d-pad. 
- Select the wall or the arrow tower.
  - If you select the wall, create a starting and ending point the same way you did with the Ramp in an earlier tutorial.
  - If you choose an arrow tower, place one using your Build View knowledge from an earlier tutorial. 
- You can build as many walls and arrow towers as you can afford. This video only focuses on the arrow towers, but feel free to build however you’d like!
- Don’t forget to spawn units as well. You’re about to defend against multiple waves of piglins.
- Remember to open the village chest once you’re finished!
