- You can also press ‘A’ to make a waypoint.

### Mouse and Keyboard

- Press ‘M’ to bring up the map, and use the mouse to scroll around it.

## Villages Under Attack

Piglins will sometimes target villages to attack, and it’s up to you to help defend them. 

### Xbox Controller

- Press ‘Start’ to pull up the map and find the village in danger.
- Navigate to that village by traveling the Overworld. Once you’ve arrived, a cutscene will play.
- Using your knowledge from the previous tutorials, build some unit spawners and spawn in units.
- Rally your units and bring them into battle. Don’t forget to use your sword as well!
- The village is saved once you’ve defeated enough of the invading piglins. The number in the middle of your screen shows how many are left.
