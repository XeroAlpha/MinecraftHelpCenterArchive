**Java**

3.  Select your Realm and click **Configure.**
4.  Select **Players** to view players and adjust permissions.

## Minecraft Realms moderation tips

- **Change player permissions**: Set player permissions to Visitor. Players will be unable to make any changes to the world, such as breaking blocks or griefing. Consider setting this as the default when players join from an invite.  
- **Remove and block players**: You also have the option to remove and block players in your Realm if you wish to restrict realm access.
- **Restore from a previous backup**: You may be able to roll back to a previous version of your world before any undesired changes were made. See [How To Create A Backup Of A Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](./How-to-Find-and-Restore-a-Backup-of-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md) or [Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms Backup FAQ](./How-to-Find-and-Restore-a-Backup-of-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).

You can also moderate your Realm through Minecraft.net. Check out the following articles for more information:
