*For Minecraft: Java Edition, see [Upload a World to a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](../Manage-Realms-Worlds/Upload-a-World-to-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md)*

If you don’t want to start a new world on your Minecraft Realm, here’s how to upload one you already created.

## How to upload a world to a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Play**.
2.  Select the **Realms** tab.
3.  Select the Realm you want to upload a world to and select **Settings**.
4.  Select either an empty world slot or a currently occupied slot to replace, then select **Edit World**.
5.  Navigate to the bottom of the Game Settings tab and select Upload **World** or **Replace World** depending on the available option.
6.  Select the world you want to upload onto the Realm.

There is a 4GB maximum world size for uploads. To upload a world from a different platform, see [Use Realms to transfer a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition World to Another Device](../Backup-Restore/Use-Realms-to-transfer-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-World-to-Another-Device.md).
