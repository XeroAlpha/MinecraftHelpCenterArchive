World seeds are a string of numbers that Minecraft uses to generate particular builds of a world when it generates. If you want to find your Minecraft Realm’s world seed to use for future world generation, you will need to first download your world. From there, you can find the world seed and copy it for future use.

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the **Edit Realm icon** (box with a checkmark in it) next to your Realm.
4.  Click the world slot of the Realm you want to download.
5.  Select **Edit World**.
6.  Click **Backups**.
7.  Select the **Download icon** of any of the backups to import the world to your non-Realms world list.
8.  Click **Let’s Go** on the All Done! screen.
9.  Exit the Edit World and Edit Realm screens to return to your Worlds list.
10. Select the **Pencil icon** next to the world you just downloaded in your Worlds list.
11. Click **Advanced**.
12. Copy your world seed.

Save that world seed for future use if you want to reuse it or share with a friend. You can paste it into the world seed section of the Advanced settings when creating a new world.
