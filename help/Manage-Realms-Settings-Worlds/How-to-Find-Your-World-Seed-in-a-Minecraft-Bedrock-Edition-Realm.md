World seeds are a string of numbers that Minecraft uses to recreate particular builds of a world when it generates. After you copy a world seed, you can share it with friends and use it to create new worlds from the same base map. You can paste it into the world seed section of the Advanced settings when creating a new world.

## Copy a world seed on the Bedrock Edition Worlds tab

1.  Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
2.  Select **Play** on the launch screen
3.  Locate the world with the seed you want to copy on the Worlds tab and select **Edit**.
4.  Select **Advanced** on the Edit World screen.
5.  Copy your World seed.

## Copy a world seed from a Bedrock Edition Realms world

If the world seed you want to copy is for a world that only exists on a Realm, you'll need to download a copy of the world from the Realm backup. After the world is listed on the Worlds tab, you can copy the seed.

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play** on the launch screen.
3.  Select the **Realms** tab on the Play screen.
4.  Select the Realm with the world seed you want to copy and select the **Settings button**. 
5.  Select the Realm slot with the world seed you want to copy.
6.  Select **Edit World**.
7.  Click **Backups**.
8.  Select the **Download icon** of any of the backups to import the world to your non-Realms world list.
9.  Click **Let’s Go** on the All Done! screen.
10. Exit the Edit World and Edit Realm screens to return to your Worlds list.
11. Select the **Pencil icon** next to the world you just downloaded in your Worlds list.
12. Click **Advanced**.
13. Copy your world seed.
