If you don’t want to start a new world on your Minecraft Realm from scratch, here’s how to upload one you already created. See instructions by edition below.

## How to upload a world to a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Play**.
2.  Select the **Realms** tab.
3.  Select the Realm you want to upload a world to and select **Settings**.
4.  Select either an empty world slot or a currently occupied slot to replace, then select **Edit World**.
5.  Navigate to the bottom of the Game Settings tab and select **Replace World**.
6.  Select the world you want to upload onto the Realm.

There is a 4GB maximum world size for uploads. If the world you want to upload is on a different platform, see [Transfer Your World to Another Device in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](../Backup-Restore/Transfer-Your-World-to-Another-Device-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md).

## How to upload a world to a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Minecraft Realms**.
2.  Select the Realm you want to change, then select **Configure**.
3.  Confirm that the active world is the one you want to replace.
    - You can identify the active world by the green checkmark in the top-right corner of its portrait.
    - If the active world is not the one you want to replace, select an empty world slot, then select **Continue** when prompted to switch.
4.  Select **Reset World**, then **Upload World**.
5.  Select the world you want to upload onto the Realm, then **Upload**.
6.  Select **Done** after the upload is complete.

There is a 4GB maximum world size for uploads. If transferring your world from a different device, see [Locating Minecraft: Java Edition Files for Backup or Transfer](../Backup-Restore/Locating-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Files-for-Backup-or-Transfer.md).
