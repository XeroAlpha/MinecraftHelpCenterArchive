Backing up your worlds in Minecraft is an important aspect of making sure you never lose your creations. In a Realm, you and your friends could have built up a world for dozens of hours, so you should be very protective of making sure you can restore it to a specific point if something should go wrong. Here is how to download your Realms world for backup in Minecraft.

## Download a Realms world in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the **Edit Realm** icon next to your Realm (box with the checkmark).
4.  Click the world slot with the Realm you want to download.
5.  Select **Edit world**.
6.  Scroll to the bottom of **Game Settings** and click **Download world**.
    - To download an older version thatâ€™s been automatically saved, select Backups and choose the file to download.

See [How Mojang Saves Backups for Your Minecraft Realm](./How-Mojang-Saves-Backups-for-Your-Minecraft-Realm.md) to learn what files are kept in the Backups section.

View [Upload Worlds onto a Minecraft Realm](./Upload-Worlds-onto-a-Minecraft-Realm.md) to put that file back into the Realm.
