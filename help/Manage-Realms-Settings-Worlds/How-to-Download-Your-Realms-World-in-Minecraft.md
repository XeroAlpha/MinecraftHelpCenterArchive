Backing up your worlds in Minecraft is an important aspect of making sure you never lose your creations. In a Realm, you and your friends could have built up a world for dozens of hours, so you should be very protective of making sure you can restore it to a specific point if something should go wrong. Here is how to download your Realms world for backup in Minecraft.

## Download a Realms world in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play** on the launch screen.
3.  Select the **Realms** tab.
4.  Select the Realm you want to manage and select **Options**.
5.  Select **Realms settings** from the Options menu.
6.  Select the Realm slot you want to edit.
7.  Select **Edit world**.
8.  Scroll to the bottom of **Game Settings** and click **Download world**.
    - To download an older version that’s been automatically saved, select Backups and choose the file to download.

See [How Mojang Saves Backups for Your Minecraft Realm](./How-Mojang-Saves-Backups-for-Your-Minecraft-Realm.md) to learn what files are kept in the Backups section.
