A Realm world is downloadable within 18 months of your subscription expiring, but the world backups associated with that Realm will be deleted 30 days after your subscription expires.

We save your progress every 30 minutes and at the end of your play session. This protects your primary save file from losing too much progress in the case of a crash and makes sure all of progress is saved properly at the end of your session. In addition to auto-saving the main save file, we also make regular backups of your primary save file.

## Realms Backup Retention Policy

We can’t keep all of your backups around forever, so the following retention policy is in place:

- The four most recent backups are retained, regardless of age.
- In the last 24 hours: We retain one backup per every 4 hours.
- 1 day to 8 days ago: We retain one backup per day.
- 9 days to 36 days ago: We retain one backup a week.
- 37 days to 121 days ago: We retain one backup a month.
- 122+ days ago: No backups are retained.

## Keeping Your Own Backup

If you’d like to save a copy of your world indefinitely, we suggest you download your work to your local storage. To learn how to make your own backup or locate and restore automated backups, see the articles below:
