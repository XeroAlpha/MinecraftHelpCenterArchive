World seeds are a string of numbers that Minecraft uses to recreate particular builds of a world when it generates. Finding the world seed for your Minecraft: Java Edition Realm is very quick and easy. It can be taken care of with just a few quick presses on your keyboard. Here is how to do it:

1.  Enter your Java Realm.
2.  When the world is loaded, press T to open the chat.
3.  Type /seed and press Enter.
4.  Your world seed will now be on display.
5.  Press T to open the chat again.
6.  Click on the seed number to copy it to your clipboard to post somewhere else.

Save that world seed for future use if you want to reuse it or share with a friend. You can paste it into the world seed section of theÂ **World** settings when creating a new world.
