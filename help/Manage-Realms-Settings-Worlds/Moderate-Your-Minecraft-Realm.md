2.  Select the **Realms** tab.
3.  Select the Realm you want to moderate and select **Settings**.
4.  Select **Manage Realm**.
5.  Select **Members** to view players and adjust permissions.

## Find Minecraft: Java Edition Realms Moderation Settings

4.  Select** Players** to view players and adjust permissions.

## Minecraft Realms moderation tips

Here are some ways to use Minecraft’s moderation tools.

- **Change players to Visitor permissions**: Visitors are unable to make any changes to the world, such as breaking blocks or griefing. Consider setting this as the default for when players join from an invite.
- **Generate a new Share Link**: If unwanted players joined from a previous Share Link, making a new one will deactivate the old one so it can’t be used to join your Realm.
- **Remove and block players**: These options will restrict realm access.
  - **Removing a player** will immediately kick them out of the game. The player will be informed they were removed. They will be able to rejoin if they receive another invite or have an invite link.
  - **Blocking a player** will immediately kick them from the game. The player will be informed they were kicked. They will not be able to rejoin unless you unblock them.
- **Restore from a previous backup**: You may be able to roll back to a previous version of your world before any undesired changes were made. See [Find and Restore a Backup of a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](./How-to-Find-and-Restore-a-Backup-of-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md) or [Find and Restore a Backup of a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](./Find-and-Restore-a-Backup-of-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).

You can also moderate your Realm through Minecraft.net. See [Edit Your Realms on Minecraft.net](./How-to-Edit-Your-Realms-on-Minecraft-net.md)[.](./How-to-Edit-Your-Realms-on-Minecraft-net.md)
