1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the box with a checkmark next to the Realm you want to edit.
4.  Select **Manage Realm**.
5.  Select **Members** to view players and adjust permissions.

## Find Minecraft: Java Edition Realms Settings

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Select your Realm and click **Configure.**
4.  Select **Players** to view players and adjust permissions.

## Minecraft Realms moderation tips

- **Change player permissions**: Set player permissions to Visitor. Players will be unable to make any changes to the world, such as breaking blocks or griefing. Consider setting this as the default when players join from an invite.
- **Generate a new Share Link**: If unwanted players joined from a previous Share Link, generating a new one will deactivate the old one so it can’t be used to join your Realm.
- **Remove and block players**: You also have the option to remove and block players in your Realm if you wish to restrict realm access.
- **Restore from a previous backup**: You may be able to roll back to a previous version of your world before any undesired changes were made. See [Find and Restore a Backup of a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](./How-to-Find-and-Restore-a-Backup-of-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md) or [Find and Restore a Backup of a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](./Find-and-Restore-a-Backup-of-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).

You can also moderate your Realm through Minecraft.net. See [Edit Your Realms on Minecraft.net](./How-to-Edit-Your-Realms-on-Minecraft-net.md)[.](./How-to-Edit-Your-Realms-on-Minecraft-net.md)
