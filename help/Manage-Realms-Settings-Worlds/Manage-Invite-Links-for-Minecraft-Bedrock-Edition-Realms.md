A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm invite link allows anyone with the link to join your Realm. This can be useful if you’re inviting multiple friends to your Realm via email or messaging. Here’s how to create and manage an invite link to your Realm.

## Create a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition invite link

1.  Select **Play** from the Minecraft launch screen.
2.  Select the **Realms** tab from the Play menu.
3.  Select the desired Realm and select the **Options** button.
4.  Select **Realm Settings** from the Options menu.
5.  Select the **Manage Realm** button.
6.  Select **Invite Links** from the Manage Realm menu.
7.  Select **Add new invite link**.
8.  Copy and share the link and adjust settings. **Activate link** needs to be “On” for players to join.

You can further customize the link by using the toggles in the General or Advanced Settings tabs before sharing it. When you share a link, anyone who opens it will see your Realm name in a browser with an option to join.
