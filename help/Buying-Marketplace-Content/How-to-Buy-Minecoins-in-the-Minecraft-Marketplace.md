The [Minecraft Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace) offers you tons of additional content to download for your account in either Minecraft: Bedrock Edition or Legends. Here is how you can purchase Minecraft currency, named Minecoins, which allow you to get this exclusive content. If you're having trouble with a Minecoin code, see [Minecoin Redemption Limit Error.](../Marketplace-Troubleshooting/Minecoin-Redemption-Limit-Error.md)

## How to buy Minecoins in the Minecraft Marketplace

1.  Launch either Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
2.  Sign into your Microsoft account on the title screen.
3.  Select Marketplace.
4.  Select the coin symbol at the top of the screen.
5.  Select the Minecoin package you want to buy.
6.  Follow the steps in the store to complete your purchase.

## How to Redeem Prepaid Cards for Minecoins

If you do not want to buy Minecoins with a saved credit card on file, prepaid cards may be available at retailers. If you have a prepaid card with a 25-digit code (5x5 code), here's how to redeem it.

1.  Visit the redeem page in your [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/redeem) or on [Minecraft.net.](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem)
2.  Enter your code and follow the on-screen instructions.
3.  Launch Minecraft and visit the Marketplace to view your Minecoin balance and verify the Minecoins were added to your account.

Regardless If you are playing Bedrock or Legends, the Minecoins you purchase will carry over with you between games if you sign in with the Microsoft account you used to purchase them.
