Minecraft allows you to set spending limits and approve in-game purchases when your child visits the Minecraft Marketplace. Minecraft uses Microsoft and Xbox family safety features to manage parental Spending controls even if you do not play Minecraft on an Xbox.

## Settings options for Spending on a child account

You can manage these **Spending** settings on the [Microsoft Family Safety website](#access-spending-settings-on-the-microsoft-family-safety-website) or in the [Xbox Family Settings app](#access-spending-settings-in-the-xbox-family-settings-app).

- **Account Balance:** Click on **Add Money** to load a specific dollar amount not the account that the child is allowed to spend using in the Minecraft Marketplace and other games or stores connected to the Microsoft account.
- **Ask to buy/Require approval:** Setting this toggle to **On** ensures that the parent account gets notifications about desired purchases and can approve or complete the purchase for the child account. You can add a card to the child account using the Microsoft Family Safety website.

## Access Spending settings on the Microsoft Family Safety website

1.  Visit the [Microsoft Family Safety](https://account.microsoft.com/family/settings) homepage.
2.  Sign in using the parent’s account.
3.  Click on the tile for the child account you want to manage.
4.  Click on **Spending** at the top of the child account settings screen.
5.  Adjust settings as desired.
6.  Sign out of Minecraft and restart for the new settings to take effect.

## Access Spending settings in the Xbox Family Settings app

1.  Launch the [Xbox Family Settings](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/family-settings-app) app on your mobile device.
2.  Sign in using the parent’s account.
3.  Tap the tile for the child account you want to manage.
4.  Tap on the **Spending** tile.
5.  Adjust settings as desired.
6.  Sign out of Minecraft and restart for the new settings to take effect.
