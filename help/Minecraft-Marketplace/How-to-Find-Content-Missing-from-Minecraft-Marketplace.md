If you purchased a [Minecraft Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace) pack or game from the Microsoft Store, Xbox Store, or through a Collection pack and can’t find it in the Minecraft app, here are some things you can try:

- **Verify the account:** The Microsoft account you use to sign into the Minecraft app needs to be the same account used for the purchase. start by making sure you are logged in to the correct account where you want these items to appear.  
- **Check** **for a child account:** Items purchased in the Minecraft Marketplace cannot be transferred from one account to another. If you make a purchase when signed into a parent account, the content will not be available in the child account.

If you find that you have redeemed a prepaid card or purchased on the wrong account, contact [Xbox support. ](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us)
