The Minecraft Marketplace offers enhancements for your game, such as add-ons, pre-built worlds, character creator items, and skin packs. If a Marketplace item seems to be missing from your game, check to make sure it is active, downloaded, or still available.

Marketplace items are available only on the account used to get them. Items purchased with a parent account will not be available in a child account and items can’t be transferred between accounts.

## View Your Marketplace Content

1.  Launch Minecraft and verify you are signed into the account you used to get your Marketplace items. 
2.  Enter the Marketplace and select My Content to view all your items.
3.  Click on an item in the list to see details and if it is activated or downloaded.

If you find that you have redeemed a prepaid card or purchased on the wrong account, [contact Xbox support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us). 

## Marketplace Content in the Marketplace Pass or Realms Plus Catalogs

If you activate or download content via a Realms Plus or Marketplace Pass subscription, that content is accessible if it remains in the subscription catalog and you keep your subscription active.

- **Items Removed from the Subscription Catalog**: If the content has been removed from the subscription services, you may see a lock icon in the Marketplace or in game. You can regain access by purchasing it from the Minecraft Marketplace. See [How To Buy Content From The Minecraft Marketplace](./How-to-Buy-Content-From-the-Minecraft-Marketplace.md).
- **Content Lost when a Subscription Ended**: If your subscription has ended and the content is still included in the subscription, you can renew your Realms Plus or Marketplace Pass subscription to get access again. If you don’t want to commit to a subscription, you can purchase the content on the Marketplace to own it.

If you are trying to access your Marketplace Pass or Realms Plus content on a different platform, see [I Can’t Find My Marketplace Pass Content](../Marketplace-Pass/I-Can-t-Find-My-Marketplace-Pass-Content.md).
