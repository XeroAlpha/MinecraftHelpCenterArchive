There is a lot of content available for you to look through on the [Minecraft Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace). After accessing the store, hereâ€™s how to get that content added to your library.

## How to buy Minecraft Marketplace content

1.  Find the content you would like to purchase on the store by exploring the various menus or using the search function.
2.  Select how you want to pay for your purchase. You can use Minecoins already in your wallet or select the price tag that will purchase the required Minecoin pack and immediately use those coins.

1.  Select **Download** to install the content on your device after your purchase is complete.

## How to access purchased content

If you play Minecraft on a different device, you can still access your purchased content without buying it again if the original device you bought it on was signed into a Microsoft account. Here is how to find that content.

1.  Sign into the same Microsoft account on the Minecraft title screen
2.  Enter **Marketplace**
3.  On the left side, select **My Content**
4.  Find the content you want to use and select **Download** on its product page
