If you want to play Minecraft as more than just Steve, you can change your skin and equip a cape at any time! Here are some steps to do so.

## How to edit your Java skin

You can create your own skin based on either the Standard or Slim character models using the reference templates below:

- [Standard](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/4px_reference.png)
- [Slim](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/3px_reference.png)

**Note:** Slim-armed skins are only fully supported in version 1.8 and higher; if you have a slim-armed skin selected in a version prior, you will see black pixels on the arms.

After you download one of the image files above, edit it to your liking. You can also find other player-made skins on the internet.
