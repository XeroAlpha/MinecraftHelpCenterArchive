Always restart your Minecraft client if experiencing Add-Ons crashing or failing to load.

Read more below to help resolve Add-On issues if they continue.

## Making a backup

When playing with Add-Ons, we encourage you to make copies of your world using these steps:

1.  Navigate to the **Edit world** screen.
2.  Select the **Game** tab.
3.  Click the **Copy World** button at the bottom of the list to create a copy of your world. 

## Finding a missing Add-On

Start by ensuring you’ve downloaded the Add-on to your system.

1.  Navigate to the Marketplace and open the product detail page for the Add-On you want to activate.
2.  Click the **Download** button. A prompt will be displayed asking you to confirm the download. 

## Add-On won't finish downloading

1.  Navigate to Settings and select **Storage**.
2.  Click **Clear Marketplace Cache**.
3.  Restart Minecraft and retry your download.

## Sideload Add-Ons from third-party websites or apps

We have no plans to remove the ability to sideload Add-Ons from popular third-party websites or mobile apps that are compliant with the [Minecraft End-User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula). 

## Stacking multiple Add-Ons

It is important to note that stacking multiple Add-Ons can increase loading times, increase potential for conflicts between add-ons, and impact general performance. We encourage you to make a backup of your World before experimenting with Add-Ons. If you have trouble with your game running slow, crashing, or other odd behavior, try removing some Add-Ons from the world.   

## Using Add-Ons on other content from the Marketplace

Currently, while the game will not prohibit you from activating an Add-On (or Add-Ons) to a world purchased in marketplace, it is likely you may encounter issues, including potential game crashes.  

## Reporting Bugs

If you’ve found an issue with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition that you’d like to report to us, you can do so by [Reporting a bug](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/bugs). Remember, if you don’t report it, we can’t fix it!
