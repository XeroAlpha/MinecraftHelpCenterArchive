When redeeming two separate codes for the same value of Minecoins in a row, you might receive the ‘you already own this product’ error. If that’s the case, follow these steps to solve the issue:

1.  After you redeem your first code, launch Minecraft and visit the Marketplace before redeeming the second code.
2.  View your Minecoin balance in the Marketplace and verify the Minecoins were added to your account.
3.  Return to the Redeem page and enter the second code.
