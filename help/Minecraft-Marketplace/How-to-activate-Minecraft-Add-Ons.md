Add-Ons are available through the Marketplace or PlayStation Store in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, and are intended only for worlds hosted on Realms.

## How to install an Add-On with a new world 

1.  Open Minecraft on your device and select **Play**.
2.  Select **Create New** on the World tab.
3.  Confirm your Add-On is loaded by clicking the **Resource Packs** and **Behavior Packs** tabs. In each tab you should see the Add-On in the Active + Local list of packs.
4.  If your owned packs are not under Active, look in the Available tab. You can then select the pack you want and press **Activate**.
5.  Click the **Create** button to create the world with the activated Add-On. 

## How to install your Add-On in an existing world 

1.  Open Minecraft and click the **Play** button.
2.  Click the pencil icon ![PencilIcon.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/24129700931085) to edit the world you’d like to activate an Add-On for.
3.  Select the **Resource Packs** tab. Currently downloaded packs will show in My Packs.
4.  Once you’ve identified the Add-On you’d like to activate, hit the **Activate** button. This will move that Add-On to the Active category. 

## How to use Add-Ons in Realms 

1.  Under the Realms section in your Worlds tab, click the pencil icon![PencilIcon.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/24129700931085).
2.  Select the world slot you want to use the Add-On for.
3.  Click **Edit World**.
4.  Navigate to the Behavior Pack or Resource Pack tabs.
5.  From this screen, you can manage all the Add-Ons active on your Realm. 

Note: If you connect to a Realm from any Minecraft: Bedrock Edition device, you will automatically download and apply any Add-Ons activated on that Realm.
