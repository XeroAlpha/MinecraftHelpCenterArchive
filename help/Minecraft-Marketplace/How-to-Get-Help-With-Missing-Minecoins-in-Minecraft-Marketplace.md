If you have purchased Minecoins but the currency is not appearing in the [Minecraft Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace) on your Microsoft account, you should contact the support team for the store where you bought them. Links to access these are below:

- [Apple](https://support.apple.com/contact)
- [Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en#topic=3364260)
- [Nintendo](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/)
- [PlayStation](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/)
- [Xbox and Windows](https://support.xbox.com/en-US)

**Note:** Minecoins will only appear in the Minecraft Marketplace if you are signed into the same Microsoft you used for the Minecoin purchase.
