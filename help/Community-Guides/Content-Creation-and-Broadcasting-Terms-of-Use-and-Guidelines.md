We love seeing what our players create online! However, we do ask you to follow a few rules when creating content.

## Brand Use Guidelines

Players are free to create, build, and mod within Minecraft if the Minecraft Usage Guidelines are followed. Fan art, logos, videos, and screen shots are acceptable if they are not used to falsely represent Mojang Studios Minecraft assets.  If you intend to use any portion of the name in relation to services, products, or distribution, you must adhere to the following requirements. 

Microsoft Services Agreement and Microsoft Terms of Use documents are designed to let you know in plain terms what you can and cannot do with your game, the Mojang Studios brand, or Mojang Studios assets.

## Video Monetization Guidelines

“Monetization” means making money from something, in this case, Mojang Studios Minecraft intellectual property. Players are allowed to create videos of Minecraft and upload or stream them on YouTube or other video sites.

## Creating Videos of Mojang Studios Games

You are allowed to create videos of Mojang games, upload or stream from YouTube or other video sites, and monetize those videos. It's free advertising for us, and we like watching you play our games!

## Using the Music in Mojang Studios Games

You are allowed to have the music from Mojang Studios games playing within a monetized video showing the gameplay of Mojang Studios games. The usage of that music outside of normal gameplay may be restricted (see below). Here are the artists’ policies on the use of their music:
