Over the years, Mojang Studios has released a large library of music tracks for our different games and projects. It’s a library that grows with at least one chiseled bookshelf every year, and each new game and update adds even more music to the collection. If you’re a content creator, you’ve probably wondered *what* you’re allowed to use from this list, and *how* you are allowed to use it. Wonder no more! Today, we’d like to help clarify those questions.

## Has anything changed?

Nope! This is the same policy we've always had, but we've been continuously seeing questions about this, so we figured it was about time we cleared things up.

First off, you’ll be happy to know that if you’re creating **Minecraft content** (material related to the Minecraft intellectual property), you’re welcome to use **our** **approved** **Minecraft-owned** music tracks in any non-commercial content *and* any commercial content that meets the Minecraft Usage Guidelines (such as monetized or sponsored YouTube videos, Twitch streams, TikTok videos, etc). To give you some examples of Minecraft content, it can include (but not limited to) things such as videos featuring playthroughs of Minecraft, streams about building with Minecraft LEGOs, Minecraft-themed podcasts, or even clips showing off Minecraft cosplay. As long as your content has Minecraft in it, you are okay to use Minecraft music.

## APPROVED MINECRAFT-OWNED MUSIC

Now, you might wonder how to tell whether a music track is approved and owned by Minecraft or not. The answer is: if it is on our official channel. Minecraft recently became a **verified artist** on Spotify. Not only are we now able to drop some blocky beats – what it truly means is that we’ve gathered lots of our Minecraft music under one easy-to-find umbrella, with the ability to **curate** our own playlists from a verified source.

To find this music, just go to our **”**[Minecraft Creator-Safe” Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5T4KWhz9Q8r98skQBimtlH)** on Spotify** and find an approved Minecraft track you’d like to use. If you are making a video, we recommend that you tag/credit the approved Minecraft track using the video platform’s tools. If the platform doesn't allow tag/crediting, please include "Music courtesy of Mojang Studios".

Please understand that there may be circumstances (for example, if there are changes to music laws), where we may have to remove or replace songs from the playlist. We apologize in advance if any such change affects your Minecraft content.

## LICENSED MUSIC

Music that isn't Minecraft-owned in-game music is typically licensed music**.** Licensed music requires special permission from a rightsholder(s) who owns the intellectual property rights to it. This type of music includes most music played on the radio, listed in the music charts, or often found in Minecraft Marketplace maps, including the ones published by us. Unfortunately, we cannot license licensed music to you - meaning you’ll have to reach out to the rightsholder to see whether or not you’re allowed to use their music in your own content.

You remain solely responsible for the content that you post, including any licensed music that is featured in that content. Please remember most platforms prohibit the use of licensed music in particular unless you have obtained appropriate licenses, or unless that platform has its own special permissions from the rightsholder for that music. Please use your best judgment and research when using licensed music.

Enjoy the tunes and keep creating!
