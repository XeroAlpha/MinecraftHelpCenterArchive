## What is Minecraft Preview?

Minecraft Preview is an evolution of the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Beta program. While our Betas were limited to Xbox, Windows, and Android, Minecraft Preview will let us expand to additional platforms. Minecraft Preview is also a separate app/game that you can play without impacting your standard Minecraft: Bedrock Edition experience, and it will let you test out the latest and greatest features.

We’re working diligently to bring Minecraft Preview to additional platforms. This FAQ will be updated the moment there is more information to share.

## Is Minecraft Beta still available?

## How do I install Minecraft Preview?

Installing Minecraft Preview will be a bit different on each platform. Let’s cover the first three platforms that will be releasing:

- On iOS, you can opt into Minecraft Preview by going [here](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftestflight.apple.com%2Fjoin%2FqC1ZnReJ&data=05%7C01%7Cv-mmoeller%40microsoft.com%7C19069cde9c8a49a609e408da9112172a%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637981804127514287%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=BhPH6ZDZyIRnfYEAKgbBvwsB2SVjGEGzbtiiKe5Myno%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://testflight.apple.com/join/qC1ZnReJ. Click or tap if you trust this link."), then signing up. Please note spots are limited, so if it is currently full, please check back later – we free up spots on or around the 1<sup>st</sup>of each month. If you do get a spot, you must update and play a new version at least once a month to maintain access due to the limited space.
- On Windows, anyone who already owns the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition or has a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass for PC can install Minecraft Preview by visiting [here](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/minecraft-preview-for-windows/9p5x4qvlc2xr) - if the install button doesn’t appear, try refreshing the page once.
  - A few players have reported the install button never appearing – if you encounter this issue try using [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P5X4QVLC2XR) and clicking “Open” to go directly to the Microsoft Store page for Minecraft Preview to install.
  - For Game Pass subscribers, you can also find Minecraft Preview in the GAME PASS section of the [Xbox application](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/xbox/9MV0B5HZVK9Z?hl=en-us&gl=US).
- On Xbox, anyone who owns Minecraft: Bedrock Edition or has a subscription to Game Pass can search for Minecraft Preview and click Install on the resulting product page – it's as simple as that! You can also find Minecraft Preview in the Xbox Game Pass library and app.

## What happened to the Minecraft Beta?

On Xbox, you can copy your existing worlds from Minecraft: Bedrock Edition using the “Sync Old Worlds” button. We are working to bring this feature to additional platforms in future updates.
