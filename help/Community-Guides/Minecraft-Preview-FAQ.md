## What is Minecraft Preview?

Minecraft Preview is an evolution of the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Beta program. While our Betas were limited to Xbox, Windows, and Android, Minecraft Preview will let us expand to additional platforms. Minecraft Preview is also a separate app/game that you can play without impacting your standard Minecraft: Bedrock Edition experience, and it will let you test out the latest and greatest features.

If you do get a spot, you must update and play a new version at least once a month to maintain access due to the limited space.
-   On Windows, anyone who already owns the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition or has a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass for PC can install Minecraft Preview by visiting [here](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/minecraft-preview-for-windows/9p5x4qvlc2xr) - if the install button doesn't appear, try refreshing the page once.
    -   A few players have reported the install button never appearing -- if you encounter this issue try using [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P5X4QVLC2XR) and clicking "Open" to go directly to the Microsoft Store page for Minecraft Preview to install.
