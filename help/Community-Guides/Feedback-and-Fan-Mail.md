## Where can I send Minecraft fan mail?  

We love getting fan mail from our players! 

For anyone wanting to send us fan mail or just show your appreciation for the work that goes into Minecraft; address your mail to: \

**Minecraft  **\
**One Microsoft Way  **\
**Redmond, WA 98052 USA **** **\

We appreciate every bit of mail we get from our wonderful players! 

## Where can I submit suggestions? 

For general feedback and suggestions for Minecraft, check out [our official Minecraft feedback site](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us). \

You can also submit suggestions at [Minecraft Suggestions on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/). It\'s an unofficial reddit page, but the developers sometimes visit and view highly rated suggestions. Because the developers can receive hundreds of suggestions a day via Reddit, Twitter, and email, they cannot view or answer each suggestion. \

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Java Edition are generally developed side-by-side, though there is the occasional difference between the two. If you\'d like to submit a suggestion, visit your console\'s corresponding sub-section on the [Minecraft Forums](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums).

If you have an idea for Minecraft: Java Edition, you can also request that a mod developer make it into a game mod by visiting the [mod request section](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/52-requests-ideas-for-mods/) of the Minecraft Forums.
