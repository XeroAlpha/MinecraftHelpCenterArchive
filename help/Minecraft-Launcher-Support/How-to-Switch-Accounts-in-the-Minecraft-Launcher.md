If you need to switch to a different Microsoft account while in the Minecraft Launcher because you have purchased games under different accounts or have someone else playing on the same computer, you can do so very quickly.

## Switching accounts in the Minecraft Launcher

1.  Click the drop-down menu next to your username in the top left of the window.
2.  Select **View all accounts**.
3.  Select **Switch Account**.
4.  Sign into the other Microsoft account.

**Note:** if you run into issues when trying to play your games, make sure you are signed into the same Microsoft account on both the Minecraft Launcher and the Microsoft Store app.
