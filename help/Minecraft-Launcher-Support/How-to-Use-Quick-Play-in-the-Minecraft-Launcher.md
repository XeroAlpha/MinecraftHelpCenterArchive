Quick Play in the Minecraft Launcher allows you to get into your Minecraft: Java or Bedrock Edition worlds faster. You can join single-player worlds, servers, and Realms through Quick Play.

**How do I use Quick Play?**

The first time that Quick Play is activated, you will need to join a world through the menu to get it to appear on the Quick Play bar. Then, follow these steps to use Quick Play in the Minecraft Launcher:

1.  Go to the Minecraft: Java or Bedrock Edition sections of the Launcher. The Quick Play bar will be visible in the top right corner of the screen.
2.  Hover over a tile to see which Minecraft world or installation it represents.
3.  Click the tile for the world you want to jump into.

Click the three dots next to the game icons to manage your Quick Play games list. Your five most recent worlds show by default. You can also change icons, pin your favorite worlds, or remove worlds from the list. Quick Play can also be disabled in the Launcher settings menu.
