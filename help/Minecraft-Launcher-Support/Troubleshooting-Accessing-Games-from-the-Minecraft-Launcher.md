If you own Minecraft but can’t launch the game because the Play button is missing, you’re likely signed into a Microsoft account that doesn’t own Minecraft. Sign out of the account you’re on in both the Minecraft Launcher and the Microsoft Store and make sure you sign into the correct account on both.

## Log out and change active accounts

### Minecraft Launcher

1.  Start the Minecraft Launcher.
2.  Click on the account name in the top left corner of the application and select **Log out**.
3.  Sign back in with the account that owns Minecraft or is subscribed to Xbox Game Pass for PC.

### Microsoft Store

1.  Open the [Microsoft Store app](http://aka.ms/MSStoreHome).
2.  Click the profile icon at the top of the page.
3.  Select **Sign Out**.
4.  Select the now blank profile icon and follow the sign in process with the Microsoft account that either owns Minecraft or is subscribed to Xbox Game Pass for PC.

Visit [Minecraft in the Microsoft store](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-for-pc/9nxp44l49shj?ocid=storeforweb) and sign in with your Microsoft account to verify game ownership. You’ll see the option to buy the game if the account you are using doesn’t own Minecraft.
