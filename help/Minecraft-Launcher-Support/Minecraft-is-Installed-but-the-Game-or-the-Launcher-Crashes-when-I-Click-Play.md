If Minecraft: Java Edition crashes when you select play, and the steps to [Fixing Crashes and Lag Issues in Minecraft](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Fixing-Crashes-and-Lag-Issues-in-Minecraft.md) didn’t help, the problem could be a conflicting mod or issues with the advanced settings. Here’s how to create a fresh Minecraft installation and return to default settings.

## How to create a new Minecraft: Java Edition installation

1.  Open the Minecraft Launcher and sign in with your Microsoft account.
2.  Select **Minecraft: Java Edition** on the left.
3.  Select the **Installations** tab at the top.
4.  Select **New installation**.
5.  Enter a name for your test installation and select the same game version as the world that’s crashing.
6.  Uncheck **Launch after Install** if you’d like to manually launch Minecraft when it’s done installing.
7.  Select **Install** and launch Minecraft once it’s done installing if needed.

If Minecraft launches successfully after you create a new installation, troubleshoot downloaded mods or advanced setting on your previous installation. You can also copy the default settings from the new installation and see if that fixes the issue on your existing world. This includes the resolution and the JVM arguments.
