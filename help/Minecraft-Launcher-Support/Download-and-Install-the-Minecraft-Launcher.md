## Minecraft Launcher Supported Operating Systems

Mojang ended support for the Minecraft Launcher for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 and for macOS versions 10.11, 10.12, 10.13 and 10.14 as of March 2025. We recommend updating your operating system to Windows 10 or later, or macOS 10.15 or later, to continue receiving Minecraft Launcher updates. You can continue to use the Minecraft Launcher for legacy operating systems without support or updates.
