Players having problems with the Minecraft Launcher are often missing dependencies or signing into the wrong Microsoft account. As a first step to solving issues with the Launcher, try these tips:

- **Uninstall and reinstall the Minecraft Launcher:** This will ensure that all necessary files are freshly installed on your computer. See [How to Download and Install the Minecraft Launcher](./How-to-Download-and-Install-the-Minecraft-Launcher.md) for information. To learn more about missing dependencies that can affect the Launcher, see [Troubleshooting Can’t Connect to Minecraft Services Error After Sign in on Minecraft Launcher](./Troubleshooting-Can-t-Connect-to-Minecraft-Services-Error-After-Sign-in-on-Minecraft-Launcher.md) and [troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting-launcher-dll-LoadErrorNotPresent-Error-in-Minecraft-Launcher.md).
- **Check signed in accounts:** The Launcher works in conjunction with Microsoft and Xbox services to validate your Minecraft license and provide access to advanced features such as Realms and parental controls. Make sure you are using the same Microsoft account with a license for Minecraft to sign into the Launcher, the [Microsoft Store app](http://aka.ms/MSStoreHome), and the [Xbox app](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/xbox-app-on-pc). See [Troubleshooting Minecraft Launcher License Error 0X803F8001](./Troubleshooting-Error-0X803F8001-in-Minecraft.md) for information.
