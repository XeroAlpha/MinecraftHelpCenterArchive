If the Minecraft Launcher for Windows crashes, freezes, or you get the error “This App Can’t Open,” you can repair the application or reinstall the launcher. The Minecraft Launcher relies on the Microsoft Store app, so resetting the cache may also fix the issue. Attempt each suggestion below one at a time.

## Repair the Minecraft Launcher app in Windows

See [Repair app and programs in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/repair-apps-and-programs-in-windows-e90eefe4-d0a2-7c1b-dd59-949a9030f317) on Microsoft’s support site and find the instructions for your operating system.

## Reinstall the Minecraft Launcher

1.  Back up your worlds using one of the options in [Backup & Restore](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125).
2.  Follow the instructions for your operating system at [Uninstall or remove apps and programs in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98) to uninstall the Minecraft Launcher.
3.  Visit the [Minecraft Launcher download page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download) to re-download and install the Launcher.

## Reset the Microsoft Store App

Try resetting the Microsoft Store cache. See [Microsoft Store doesn't open](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/microsoft-store-doesn-t-open-126a875d-8b72-def1-0af6-d325276a058b) on Microsoft’s support site.
