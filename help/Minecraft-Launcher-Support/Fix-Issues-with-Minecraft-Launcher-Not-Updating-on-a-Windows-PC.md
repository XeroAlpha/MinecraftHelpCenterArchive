When there’s an update for the Minecraft Launcher, it will normally download and install automatically when you open it. If the Launcher freezes or stalls while updating, here are suggestions to fix it.

## Repair and Reset the Minecraft Launcher

1.  Go to the Start Menu.
2.  Search for “**Minecraft Launcher**.”
3.  Right-click on the Minecraft Launcher.
4.  Select **App Settings**.
5.  Select **Repair**.
6.  Open the Minecraft Launcher after the repair operation is completed.
7.  If the Launcher still gets stuck, repeat steps 1-4, select **Reset**, and open the Launcher.

## Reset the Microsoft Store

If your launcher update still doesn’t complete after the Repair and Reset process, reset the Microsoft Store to fix other background processes the Launcher needs to update.

1.  Select **Windows key** + **R** to open the Windows Run dialogue.
2.  Enter **WSReset**.
3.  Select **OK**.
4.  Open the Minecraft Launcher after the repair operation is completed.

## Use the Gaming Services Repair Tool

Minecraft uses Xbox services to deliver game updates. Running the [Gaming Services Repair Tool](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/troubleshooting/gaming-services-repair-tool) can fix issues with updating the Launcher or Minecraft.
