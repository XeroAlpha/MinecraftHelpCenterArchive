If you are trying to play Minecraft on PC, but the game or Launcher crashes when you click play, there are usually a couple of easy fixes that include making a new Java installation or resetting the Microsoft Store.

### Java Edition

If you are trying to play Minecraft: Java Edition and it keeps crashing, you may have a mod that is messing up your game. We recommend first making sure that you are running the latest version release of Java Edition.  If you are, try backing up your save, which you can learn more about on our [managing data and game storage page,](../Backup-Restore/Locating-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Files-for-Backup-or-Transfer.md) and then creating a new Java installation.

**How to create a new Java installation**

1.  Go to the **Installation** tab under Minecraft: Java Edition.
2.  Click on **New installation.**
3.  Name your world and select the version you want the world to be.
4.  If your new install works, check your downloaded mods on the previous install to find what is preventing you from playing.

### Bedrock and other Minecraft games

If you keep getting met with crashes when trying to play Bedrock or other Minecraft games, try to reset the Microsoft Store.

**Reset the Microsoft Store**

1.  Press the **Windows key** + **R** simultaneously .
2.  A window will appear. Type in **WSReset** and hit enter.

If the above did not help, make sure your operating system and video/graphics drivers are updated.
