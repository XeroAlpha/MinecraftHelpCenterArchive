## How do I switch between my Microsoft accounts to play my games?

You can click your username in the top left corner. From the drop down, select **Switch Account**. This will bring up a new window allowing you to sign into another Microsoft account. If multiple accounts have been added, this button will allow you to switch between them. You can also open Settings and look under the **Accounts** tab. This will also allow you to switch accounts or add new ones. Please note that you can only be signed in to one Microsoft account at a time.

If you are running into issues when trying to play Minecraft, make sure you are signed into the same Microsoft account on the Microsoft Store, the Xbox app, and the Minecraft Launcher.

## I can’t sign in to my Launcher

If the Minecraft Launcher is running but you receive an error signing in, double-check that you’re using the correct email address. If you still can’t sign in, visit [Get Help with Your Microsoft Account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/get-help-with-your-microsoft-account-ace6f3b3-e2d3-aeb1-6b96-d2e9e7e52133).

## Launcher won’t start up or crashes during sign in

If your Launcher crashes when you try to sign in or you get the error “This App Can’t Open” on Windows, try repairing the application:

**Repair the Minecraft Launcher app in Windows**

1.  Open the Start menu
2.  Right-click the Minecraft Launcher icon
3.  Select **More**
4.  Open **App Settings**
5.  Click **Repair** and **Reset **

If repairing the application doesn’t work, [download and reinstall the Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download) or visit [Troubleshooting Installing the Minecraft Launcher](./Troubleshooting-Installing-the-Minecraft-Launcher.md).

## My Launcher is working and I can sign in, but I have to re-enter my credentials every time

Try cleaning up your cached account tokens in the Minecraft Launcher.

**Clear cached account tokens**

1.  In the Launcher, click **Settings**
2.  Click the **Accounts** tab
3.  Click the **Advanced Options** at the bottom to open it
4.  Select **Clean up cached account tokens**
