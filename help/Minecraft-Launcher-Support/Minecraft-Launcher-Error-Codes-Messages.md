## Error 0X80242020 after installing Bedrock Edition

**Find new places to install Minecraft: Bedrock Edition**

## You must complete adult verification on the Xbox homepage error

This error appears when the country/region set on your Xbox Live account is different than the country/region set on your Microsoft account.

## Resolving Minecraft Launcher.dll error

If you see a **launcher.dll: LoadErrorNotPresent** error message when you try to open the Minecraft: Java Edition launcher, it means a file is missing. 

Manually update the Minecraft launcher. See [Minecraft: Java Edition Installation Issues](../Download-Install/System-Requirements-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md) for instructions.

## Security update available

You will receive this message if you are not using the most recent version of the Launcher software. We recommend you update your Minecraft Launcher to avoid any problems with data loss, lost worlds, or any other issues that may have been identified and fixed in the software update.
