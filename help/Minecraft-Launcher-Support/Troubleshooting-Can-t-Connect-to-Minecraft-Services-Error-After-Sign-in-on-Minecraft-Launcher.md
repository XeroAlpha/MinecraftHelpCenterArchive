If your PC is saying you can’t connect to Minecraft services after you sign in to the Minecraft Launcher, ensure that you’re properly connected to the internet. Also, the Minecraft Launcher and Microsoft Store are connected, so make sure you are signed into the same account on both the Microsoft Store app and in the Minecraft Launcher. If you’re still getting the error, there are a few steps you can try that might address this issue.

## Install missing key dependencies or applications

1.  Install and sign into the [Xbox App.](https://aka.ms/DLXboxApp)
2.  If any dependencies are missing, the Xbox app should show you a list and recommend installation actions to fix these problems.
3.  Install missing dependencies that are recommended.
4.  Examples include:
    - [Xbox Identity Provider](https://aka.ms/XboxIdentityProvider)
    - [Xbox Live In-Game Experience](https://aka.ms/XboxIdentityProvider)
    - [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/DLFeedbackHub)

## Reset the Microsoft Store

1.  Press the **Windows key + R** simultaneously.
2.  Type in **WSReset** and hit enter.
