If you play Minecraft on a computer shared with another player, you may want to change which Microsoft account is logged in to the Minecraft Launcher to play on a separate account and keep your saved progress and achievements separate. Here’s how to switch the active account.

## How to switch Microsoft Accounts in the Minecraft launcher

1.  Select your username in the upper-left corner of the Minecraft launcher.
2.  Select **view all accounts** from the dropdown menu.
3.  Select **Switch Account**.
4.  A pop-up will appear with a, “Welcome back, \[username\]” message. Select **Sign in with a different account**.
5.  Select an account to sign in with from the accounts shown or select **Use a different account** to sign in with a different Microsoft Account.
6.  The pop-up should now display the account you just signed in with. Select **Let’s go**.

You may see a Minecraft Launcher pop-up notifying you that “Accounts in Microsoft Store and Launcher do not match” if the account you just signed in with does not match the one in signed in to the Xbox app/Microsoft Store.

If you see this pop-up, here are your options:

- **Match the signed-in accounts**: Select **Change Launcher Login** if you’d like Microsoft Store and Minecraft Launcher logins to match. This allows you to make marketplace purchases on your account.
- **Keep mismatching accounts**: Select **Close** or **Go to Microsoft Store** if you do not want to sign in to the Xbox app/Microsoft Store with your current account.
