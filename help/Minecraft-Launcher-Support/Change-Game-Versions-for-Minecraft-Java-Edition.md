By default, Minecraft is set to the most current version of the game. Changing the version requires creating a launcher configuration with the desired version and then set the game to use that configuration.   
  
**WARNING:** Before changing your game version, it's strongly recommended that you back up your worlds. If you try to play on one of your current worlds and you access that world using an older version of the game, you may permanently damage that world**.** It's strongly recommended that you back up your worlds by locating them and then making a copy of your game files. See [Save a Backup of Your Minecraft: Java Edition World](../Backup-Restore/Save-a-Backup-of-Your-Minecraft-Java-Edition-World.md).

## How to change the game version for Java Edition
