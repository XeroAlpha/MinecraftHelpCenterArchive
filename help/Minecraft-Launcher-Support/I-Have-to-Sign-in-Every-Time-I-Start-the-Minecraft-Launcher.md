If the Minecraft Launcher is working for you, but it tells you to sign in every time you start it, try cleaning up your cached account tokens. Follow these steps:

## Clear cached account tokens

1.  In the Launcher, click **Settings.**
2.  Click the **Accounts **tab.
3.  Click the **Advanced Options** at the bottom to open it.
4.  Select **Clean up cached account tokens**.
