Players enjoying Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, Minecraft Dungeons, or Minecraft Legends on Xbox One or Xbox Series consoles will need an Xbox Live account and an internet connection to take advantage of cloud saving, but they **do not need a subscription to Xbox Live**.

When using an Xbox One or Series console that’s connected to the internet, saves are automatically backed up onto the cloud. You don’t have to follow any additional steps to upload cloud saves on an Xbox One or Series console.

**Note: Alongside the following processes, Minecraft Dungeons has an in-game cloud saving process as well. Please follow [this guide](../Minecraft-Dungeons/Upload-and-Download-Heroes-to-the-Cloud-in-Minecraft-Dungeons.md)** **for more information.**

To download a cloud save onto your Xbox One or Series console, follow these steps: 

1.  Press the **Home button** on your Xbox controller.
2.  Navigate to the **My games & apps** option.
3.  Select **See all**.
4.  Navigate to either Minecraft, Minecraft Dungeons, or Minecraft Legends in your games list.
5.  Press the **Select** button to open the **Manage game** menu.
6.  Scroll to the **Saved data** option.
7.  Select your profile and choose **Delete from console** to delete your local save.
8.  Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, Minecraft Legends, or Minecraft Dungeons and your Xbox will sync with the cloud, downloading the latest version of your save.
