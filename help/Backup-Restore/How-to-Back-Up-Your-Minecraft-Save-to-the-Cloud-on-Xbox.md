If you play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, Minecraft Dungeons, or Minecraft Legends on Xbox One or Xbox Series consoles, you need an Xbox Live account and an internet connection to take advantage of cloud saving. However, you do not need a subscription to Xbox Live. Saves files are automatically backed up onto the cloud. 

## How to download a cloud save onto your Xbox One or Series console

1.  Press the **Home button** on your Xbox controller.
2.  Navigate to the **My games & apps** option.
3.  Select **See all**.
4.  Navigate to either Minecraft, Minecraft Dungeons, or Minecraft Legends in your games list.
5.  Press the **Select** button to open the **Manage game** menu.
6.  Scroll to the **Saved data** option.
7.  Select your profile and choose **Delete from console** to delete your local save.
8.  Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, Minecraft Legends, or Minecraft Dungeons and your Xbox will sync with the cloud, downloading the latest version of your save.

Note: Minecraft Dungeons has an in-game cloud saving process as well. See [Upload and Download Heroes to the Cloud in Minecraft Dungeons](../Minecraft-Dungeons-Support/Upload-and-Download-Heroes-to-the-Cloud-in-Minecraft-Dungeons.md) for information.
