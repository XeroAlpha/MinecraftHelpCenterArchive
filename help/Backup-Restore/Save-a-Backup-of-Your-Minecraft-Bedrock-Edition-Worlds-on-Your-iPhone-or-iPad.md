If you play Minecraft on an iPhone or iPad, you can connect your iOS device to a Mac OS computer to make a backup copy of your worlds so that you can restore worlds later or transfer worlds to another iOS device. The instructions below will only make a copy of your Minecraft worlds created on your iOS device. If you want to backup files created on a Mac OS device, see [Save a Backup of Your Minecraft: Java Edition World](./Save-a-Backup-of-Your-Minecraft-Java-Edition-World.md).

1.  Connect your iOS device to your MacOS computer using a USB cable.
2.  Open a Finder window and select your device under **Locations**.
3.  Select **Files** from the options for your device.
4.  Expand **Minecraft** folder.
5.  Click and drag the **games** folder to your desktop or another location to save it as a backup.

You can also use iCloud to create a backup of your games folder. Visit [Set up iCloud Drive on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-icloud-drive-iphbbcf8827d/26/ios/26) on the Apple Support page to learn more about managing your iCloud storage.
