If you need to rollback a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition world to before you enabled add-ons, a build was destroyed, or achievements were disabled, you can restore a previous backup or recreate your world from its world seed.

## Restore an automatic backup

Restore an automatic backup to reset your world to the point in time the backup was made. If you have automatic backups enabled through your console or Minecraft Realms, follow the steps in these articles to restore an existing save file:

## Restore manual world backups

If you have a manual world backup, restore it by moving your backup file to the location of your current world files as described in the article for your platform:

## Recreate a world from a world seed

If you don't have a backup with your builds but like a world map you were playing, use a world seed to restore your world to its original state. Creating a world from a seed will not restore any progress, but it will let you play through a familiar world.

1.  [Copy Your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition World Seed](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/34467729058957)
2.  Launch Minecraft and select the **Worlds** tab.
3.  Select **Create new world** twice, once on the Worlds tab and again on the **Create from...** screen.
4.  Select Advanced settings on the Create New World screen.
5.  Paste in your world seed and select **Create**.
