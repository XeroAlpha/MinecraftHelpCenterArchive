To preserve a copy of your Java Edition world that you can store or transfer, you must create a manual backup. Backups are stored in a folder on your device, which you can easily navigate to either through your Java Edition game or the Minecraft Launcher. See [Save a Backup of Your Minecraft: Java Edition World](./Save-a-Backup-of-Your-Minecraft-Java-Edition-World.md) to learn how to save your worlds.

## Find your Java Edition backups folder in the game

1.  Open Minecraft: Java Edition.
2.  Select **Singleplayer**.
3.  Select your world.
4.  Select **Edit**.
5.  Select **Open Backups Folder**.

## Find your Java Edition backups folder with the Minecraft Launcher

1.  Open the **Minecraft launcher** and sign in.
2.  Select the **Minecraft: Java Edition** tab on the sidebar.
3.  Select the **Installations** tab on the top of the screen.
4.  Highlight the Minecraft installation you used to back up your world.
5.  Select the **folder** **icon** to open the installations folder on your computer.
6.  Select the **backups** folder.

You can move this backup to an external hard drive for safekeeping or transfer it to another device running Minecraft: Java Edition.
