If your Minecraft world isn’t associated with a Realms subscription, your worlds are not backed up automatically. It is a good idea to periodically backup or save a copy of your Minecraft files.

## Here’s how to find where your Minecraft Worlds are stored:

1.  Open the Minecraft launcher and sign in.
2.  Navigate to **Minecraft: Java Edition**.
3.  Select **Installations** on the top tab.
4.  Hover your mouse over the installation you want to find. The default is **Latest release**.
5.  Click the Folder icon ![FolderIcon.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/24788427284237)to launch your file browser.

From your file browser, you can now make backup copies of your Saves folder or entire installation folder or transfer them to another folder or device.
