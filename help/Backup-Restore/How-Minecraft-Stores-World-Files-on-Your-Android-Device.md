Your worlds on Minecraft for Android are stored in the File Storage Location that was selected in your Minecraft storage settings when you created your world. You can have worlds stored in both Application and External File Storage Location options and switch between the two options to change which Minecraft worlds appear on your play screen.

## Find or change where your Minecraft worlds are stored on Android

If you don’t see a world you created on your Android device on the Minecraft Play screen, you can change your File Storage Location to see if it is stored in an alternate location. If you want to have Minecraft worlds you create available for manual backup or transfer, you can set your file storage location to External.

1.  Open Minecraft on your Android device.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Select **Storage**.
4.  View or change the setting under **File Storage Location**. Options are **Application** or **External**.

## Minecraft for Android world storage location options

- **Application**: This is the default setting. Your world files and progress data are stored within the Minecraft application data and is not available as separate files or folders you can export to a computer for backup. See [Use Realms to Transfer a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition World to Another Device](./Use-Realms-to-Transfer-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-World-to-Another-Device.md).
- **External**: “External” storage means that your files are stored outside the Minecraft application and not necessarily on an external storage device, such as an SD card. Minecraft worlds created when the External setting is selected are stored in an accessible folder at **Android \> data \> com.mojang.minecraftpe \> files \> games \> com.mojang \> minecraftWorlds** and can be downloaded for backup or transfer to another Android device.
