Having access to your files to create backups or maybe transfer them to another device is important to making sure you donâ€™t lose your data. Here is how to find them.

## How to access Minecraft Bedrock world files on iOS via Files app

1.  Open the Files app.
2.  Tap **On my iPad/iPhone**.
3.  Tap **Minecraft**.
4.  Tap **Games**.
5.  Tap **com.mojang**.
6.  Open **minecraftWorlds**.

In this folder you will find all of your worlds and various Marketplace content like behavior packs, resource packs, and world templates.

## How to access Minecraft Bedrock world files on Android

World files on your Android can only be accessed if they are in external storage, not the application. If they are not, the only way to access your worlds is to transfer them to another device using Minecraft Realms. See [How to Transfer Your World To Another Device In Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./Use-Realms-to-transfer-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-World-to-Another-Device.md).

To learn if your worlds are in external storage:

1.  Start Minecraft on your Android device.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Scroll down to **Storage**.
4.  Just under **File Storage Location**, it will say either **Application** or **External**.

To find the worlds folder on external storage:

1.  Open File Explorer.
2.  Open the storage device with your world.
3.  Open **Android**.
4.  Open **com.mojang.minecraftpe**.
5.  Open **files**.
6.  Open **games**.
7.  Open **com.mojang**.
8.  Open **minecraftWorlds**.

If you are moving any worlds between devices, we highly recommend first making a copy of them before you do so.
