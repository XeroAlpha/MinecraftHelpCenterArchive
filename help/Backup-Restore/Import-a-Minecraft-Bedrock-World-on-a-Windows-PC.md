You can import a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition World you have backed up from another device or previously saved onto your Windows PC. If you havenâ€™t exported a world yet, start with [Save a Backup of Your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition World on Windows.](./Export-and-Import-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-World-on-Windows-PC.md)

1.  Copy your saved World file to your Windows PC.
2.  Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
3.  Select **Play**.
4.  Select the **Import world** button from the Worlds tab.
5.  Locate the world file you copied from a backup and select **Import**.

The world will now display among your singleplayer world choices. To transfer a world using Minecraft Realms, see [Use Realms to Transfer a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition World to Another Device](./Use-Realms-to-Transfer-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-World-to-Another-Device.md).
