If you installed Minecraft: Java Edition on a new computer, you can transfer your Minecraft: Java Edition worlds, so you can keep building without starting over. If you have not exported a backup file of your world to transfer, visit [Save a Backup of Your Minecraft: Java Edition World](./Save-a-Backup-of-Your-Minecraft-Java-Edition-World.md) to learn how.

1.  Copy the zipped backup file to your new computer and unzip it.
2.  Move the folder containing the unzipped world folder into your Minecraft **saves** folder on the new computer.
3.  Windows: **%appdata%\\minecraft\saves**
4.  macOS: **~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves**
5.  Launch Java Edition.
6.  Select **Singleplayer**. Your world will now appear as a playable option.
