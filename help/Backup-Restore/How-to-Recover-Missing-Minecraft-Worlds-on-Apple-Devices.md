1.  Make sure your app is up to date by going to the App store and selecting **Update**.
2.  Launch the Minecraft app on your Apple device.
3.  Open the Minecraft Marketplace.
4.  Select the **Store**.
5.  Scroll down to purchases and select **Restore Purchases**.

If you made purchases through the App Store, you can also restore your purchases in the App Store. Doing so requires you to use the account associated with the Apple device.

To restore missing game data, you can either check if it has been stored through the iTunes backup or through Apple iCloud storage. Apple iCloud storage restoration will work only if you have the iCloud file sharing service enabled on your device.
