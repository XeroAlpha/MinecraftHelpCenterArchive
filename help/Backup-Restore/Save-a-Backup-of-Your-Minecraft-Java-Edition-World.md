Minecraft: Java Edition allows you to create a backup of any single-player world. It is always a good idea to save a backup copy of your Minecraft world to protect your progress.

1.  Launch **Minecraft: Java Edition**.
2.  Select **Singleplayer**.
3.  Select the world you want to back up, then select the **Edit** button.
4.  Select **Make Backup** on the Edit World screen.

A backup of your Java Edition world will appear as a .zip file with the date of the backup included in the title. You can view available backup files by returning to the Edit World screen and selecting **Open Backups Folder**.

For more information about locating existing backups of your Java Edition worlds, visit Find Your Minecraft: Java Edition Backup Files.
