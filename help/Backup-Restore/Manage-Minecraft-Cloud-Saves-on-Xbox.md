Xbox automatically saves your most recent Minecraft files in the cloud. Here's how to confirm you have automatic saves enabled and restore cloud saves to your device.

## Enable automatic cloud saves on Xbox

If your Xbox is online and your Microsoft account is signed in, your Minecraft save data will automatically be saved to the cloud. See [Manage your cloud gaming saves and storage](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/cloud-gaming/manage-storage) on the Xbox support website.

## Restore a cloud save on Xbox

Xbox automatically restores your most recent cloud save if files are missing on your device. If your device's save is old, here's how to delete it and restore from the cloud:

1.  Press the **Home** **button** on your Xbox controller and select **my games & apps**.
2.  Select **See all** and find **Minecraft** in your games list.
3.  Press the **Menu** button to open the **Manage** **game** menu.
4.  Find the **Saved** **data** option.
5.  Select your **profile** and **Delete** **from** **console**.
6.  Launch Minecraft.

Your Xbox will sync with the cloud and download the latest version of your save.
