If you play a Minecraft world on one device and want make a locally stored copy to play on another device, you can transfer a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition world from one device to another using [Minecraft Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms). Minecraft Realms allows you to upload worlds to the cloud and download them to local storage.

## Transfer a Bedrock world between devices with Minecraft Realms

Verify that you have an [active trial or paid Realms subscription](../Create-or-Join-Realms/Create-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md) and both the host device and destination device are updated to the most recent version of Minecraft before starting this process.

1.  Launch Minecraft on the world hosting device.
2.  Select **Play** on the launch screen.
3.  Select the Realms tab and select the Realm you want to use to transfer.
4.  Select **Settings** on the Realm.
5.  Select a world slot and select **Edit World**.
6.  Navigate to the bottom of the Game Settings tab.
    - Select **Upload World** if you’re using an empty Realm slot.
    - Select **Replace World** if you’re overwriting an existing world.
7.  Confirm you want to upload the world to the current Realms slot.
8.  Launch Minecraft on the destination device and sign in with your Microsoft account.
9.  Select **Play** from the launch screen.
10. Select the Realms tab and select the Realm with the world you want to transfer.
11. Select **Settings** on the Realm.
12. Select the slot with the world you want to transfer and select **Edit World**.
13. Navigate to the bottom of the Game Settings tab and select **Download World**.

The world will appear on the Worlds tab on the new device as “World name - Copy.” Select the pencil icon to rename it.
