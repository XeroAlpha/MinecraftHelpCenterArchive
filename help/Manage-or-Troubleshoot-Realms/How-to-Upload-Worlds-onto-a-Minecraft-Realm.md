If you donâ€™t want to start a Minecraft Realm from scratch, you can upload one of your already created worlds. Here is how to do it:

**How to upload a world onto a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm**

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the **Edit** icon next to the Realm you want to upload the world to.
4.  Select either an empty world slot or you can replace a currently occupied slot by selecting **Edit World**.
5.  In Game Settings, scroll to the bottom and select **Replace World**.
6.  Select the world you want to upload onto the Realm up to 4 GB in size.
    - **Note:** If the world you want to upload is on a different platform, you will need to [transfer your world](../Backup-Restore/How-to-Transfer-Your-World-to-Another-Device-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) or upload it on that platform.

**How to upload a world onto a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm**

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Select the Realm you want to change and press **Configure**.
4.  Select an empty world slot or select an existing one and press **Reset World**.
5.  Select **Upload World**.
6.  Select the world you want to upload onto the Realm up to 4 GB in size.
    - If transferring your world from a different device, see [Locating Minecraft: Java Edition Files For Backup Or Transfer](../Backup-Restore/Locating-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Files-for-Backup-or-Transfer.md).
