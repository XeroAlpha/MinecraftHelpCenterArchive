If you’re playing on a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm and are looking to protect you or your child from harsh language, the game now includes a profanity filter. If you are an adult, you can turn off the profanity filter. Child accounts cannot have the filter turned off.

## How to disable the Minecraft: Java Edition Realms profanity filter

1.  [Log in with your Microsoft Account](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login) on Minecraft.net.  
2.  Navigate to the **My Account** tab on the side bar. 
3.  Scroll down to find **Java Realms Profanity Filter**.
4.  The toggle is on by default, but you can click it to switch between on and off as you wish.

Note that the profanity filter will only affect you and your Minecraft account. It will not affect the experience of other players within the Minecraft: Java Edition Realm. 

## Profanity filter is grayed out with an adult Microsoft account

If the Java Edition profanity filter is grayed out, but you’re logged into an adult Microsoft account, it’s likely that your Minecraft: Java Edition entitlement isn’t detected. Make sure you are signed into the proper account that owns Minecraft or is subscribed to Xbox Game Pass for PC. If you own Bedrock Edition, see [I Own Minecraft: Java Or Bedrock Edition For PC. How Do I Get The Other?](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/I-Own-Minecraft-Java-or-Bedrock-Edition-for-PC-How-Do-I-Get-the-Other.md)
