As the owner of your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm, various administrative and management options are available to you. This article details everything you need to know about how to manage your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm.

## Administrative options

To view your Realm’s administrative options, open Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and navigate to the **Worlds** menu. From there, click on the **Slots** button next to the Realm you want to configure.

You’re provided with the following Realms management options:

- Realm management
  - By clicking on Manage Realm, you’ll see three Realm management options. Game Settings, Members, and Subscription.
    - **Note: You can also manage your Realms on Minecraft.net. Please refer to [How to Edit Your Realms on Minecraft.net](./How-To-Edit-Your-Realms-on-Minecraft-net.md) for more information.**
- Game Settings
  - Here, you can adjust your Realm Name, your Realm Description, and manage your Realm’s Feed.
  - You can also choose to unlock recipes for players within your Realm.
- Members
  - The Members tab allows you to view your Realm’s current members, adjust their permissions, invite new members, and adjust a player’s default permission status when accepting a Realms invite.
- Subscription
  - The subscription tab shows you your Realm’s size and the time remaining on your subscription Realm’s subscription. You can also choose to delete your Realm or manage your subscription.

## World management

Your Realm comes with three different world slots. You can only have one slot active at a time, but each slot consists of an entirely different world for you and your friends to play on. For example, you can have two survival worlds and one creative world.

Each world slot has its own world settings, which you can adjust by clicking on that world slot and selecting **Edit World**. The **Edit World** screen is similar to that of a single-player world, and allows you to adjust in-game settings, Resource Packs, and Behavior Packs. You can also require a player to accept your chosen Resource Pack before they can join your Realm. For more on adding Resource and Behavior Packs to your Realm, please refer to [What are Minecraft Add-Ons?](../Minecraft-Marketplace/What-are-Minecraft-Add-Ons.md)

To adjust which world is active, select the world slot containing your preferred world and click **Activate Realm**.

## Realm backups

Visit the [Realms Backup FAQ](./Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-Backup-FAQ.md) for more information.

## World management issues

If a world in your Realm is misbehaving, cannot be opened/closed, or seems broken in any way, try moving that world to a different world slot. Before changing world slots, make sure to [backup/save your world data](./Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-Backup-FAQ.md). If the slot remains broken, go into Edit World for that slot and click Reset World. This should fix the slot and you can upload your backed up save to use it again.

## Realm’s Feed

You can view your Realm’s Stories by clicking on the open book icon.

Here, you can view any posts players have made to your Realm’s feed as well as make your own via the **New Post** button. You can also interact with posts by liking or commenting.

You can delete Realm’s Feed posts by clicking on the **…** next to it and selecting **Delete.**
