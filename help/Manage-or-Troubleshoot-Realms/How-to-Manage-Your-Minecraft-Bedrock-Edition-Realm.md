As the owner of your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm, various administrative and management options are available to you. This article details everything you need to know about how to manage your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm.

## How to access the Manage Realm options

To view your Realmâ€™s administrative options, follow the below steps:

1.  Open Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the **Edit Realm** (box with a checkmark in it) button next to your Realm.
4.  Select **Manage Realm**.

From the Manage Realm area, you can do the following:

- Change the Realm name
- Manage members on the Realm
- Close Realm or manage your subscriptions

**Note:** You can also manage your Realms on Minecraft.net. Please refer to [How to Edit Your Realms on Minecraft.net](./How-To-Edit-Your-Realms-on-Minecraft-net.md) for more information.

## How to change or edit Realm worlds

To manage the world on your Realm, do the following:

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Click the **Edit Realm** button next to your Realm.
4.  Select the Realm slot you want to edit.
5.  Select **Edit World**.

Here is a list of things you can manage here:

- Change settings for the active world
- Download and restore backups
- Manage resource and behavior packs

For more on adding Resource and Behavior Packs to your Realm, please refer to [What are Minecraft Add-Ons?](../Minecraft-Marketplace/What-are-Minecraft-Add-Ons.md)

For backups, see [How to Find and Restore a Backup of a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](./Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-Backup-FAQ.md) or [How Mojang Saves Backups for Your Minecraft Realm](./How-Mojang-Saves-Backups-for-Your-Minecraft-Realm.md).

## How to troubleshoot Realm world errors

If a world in your Realm is misbehaving, cannot be opened/closed, or seems broken in any way, try moving that world to a different world slot. Before changing world slots, make sure to backup/save your world data. If the slot remains broken, go into Edit World for that slot and click Reset World. This should fix the slot and you can upload your backed up save to use it again.
