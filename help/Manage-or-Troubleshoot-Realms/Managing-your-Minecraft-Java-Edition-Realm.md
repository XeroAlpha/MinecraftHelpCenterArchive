This article is dedicated to managing an already made Minecraft: Java Edition Realm. For questions regarding creating a Java Realm, [see this article](../Create-or-Join-Realms/How-to-Create-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md).

## Realms Admin Options

Realms owners have various admin options available for further customization. From the Realms menu, selecting **Configure **on your Realm will enable you to implement the following options:

### Have Multiple Worlds

In your Realm, you have three different world slots and an additional slot that you can use for minigames. You can have three different worlds loaded in your Realm. This means you can hold two survival worlds and one creative world for example. Each slot has its own world settings. However, only one slot can be active at a time.

### Close the server

In the Settings menu, you can choose to close your server and take it offline. Closing the server will back up your world, but this action will not affect world data or your subscription in any way. While your server is closed, all Realm members will not be able to play on that Realm until it is opened again. You can open your server again anytime by going by to the Settings menu.

### Players

- Invite Player
  - Select the button to invite another player by entering their Minecraft username. The player will be added to your invited players list even if the invitation is not accepted.
- Remove a player
  - Select the red X to remove a player from your list of invited players. 
- Making a player an operator
  - Select the grayed-out crown icon to promote a player to an operator. Operators can use slash commands, send private messages, and set the world spawn point. Operators can't invite or remove players or delete your world, but you should still pick a player you trust to promote as you are giving that person the ability to mess with your world on a deeper level than normal.  Select the gold crown icon to make that player a normal user once again.
- Reporting a player
  - If a player on your Realm is being unruly, either the owner or any player can report them to Minecraft Support. Visit this page for more information.
- Settings
  - Lets you set the name and description of your Realm. 

## Subscription

Select Subscription to see your Minecraft Realms subscription status or to extend your subscription. 

- Options
  - For game options for the active world, see the [How to Create Your Realm article](../Create-or-Join-Realms/How-to-Create-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md).
- Backups
  - Enables you to see and switch between your backups as well as download the currently loaded backup. For more, see the How to Create a Backup of a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm article.
- Reset
  - This option lets you generate a new world, load a premade world template, or upload your own world. Note that resetting your world with any of these options will delete your current world and all backups.
