The Minecraft Launcher has a section that allows you to manage and jump directly into your Realms. To find it:

1.  Open the Minecraft Launcher.
2.  Make sure you are signed in with your Microsoft account.
3.  Select either **Minecraft: Java Edition** or **Minecraft for Windows**.
4.  Click the **Realms** tab.

When in this section, you can do the following:

- View any Realms you’re currently a part of.
- Accept or deny any pending Realms invites.
- View a Realm’s description.
- See how many players are in-game per Realm.
- View any expired Realms subscriptions.
- Begin a Realms trial.
- Access shortcuts to join a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm if the Realm subscription is active.
- Leave a Realm.

To cancel your Realm or manage it in other ways, click **Manage Realms** to be taken to the Minecraft.net site where you can sign in. Visit the below links for more info:
