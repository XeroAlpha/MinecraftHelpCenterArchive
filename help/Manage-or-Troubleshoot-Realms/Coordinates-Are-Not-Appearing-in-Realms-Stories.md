Realms Stories will keep a record of some of the biggest accomplishments that happen within your Realm. You may want to get all the information from these updates, which could include the coordinates for where that event happened.

With the **Realm Event coordinates** setting turned on in your Realm Stories, you will be able to see the location of certain Realm Events when they appear on your story feed. For coordinates to appear in a Realm Story, the world must display them with the **Show Coordinates** setting turned on. This allows the game to show your coordinates in the world at all times. If that and the Realm Event Coordinates setting is turned on, some Realms Stories will display a coordinate. Have the owner of the Realm do the following.

**How to turn on Show Coordinates**

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the **Edit Realm** icon.
4.  Click your world and select **Edit World**.
5.  Under World Options select Show Coordinates.

Additionally, you can also find them through the following when in the world:

1.  Bring up the menu.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Scroll down to find **Show Coordinates** under World Options.

**Note:** Not all Realm Events will include an accompanying set of coordinates. If you notice one story not showing where it happened, it may have just been because that event doesnâ€™t include the location.
