*This article applies only to *[older Minecraft accounts](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408867060621-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Account-Types)*. For Minecraft on a Mojang account (in which you log in with your email address), see *[*Change Your Email Address (Mojang Accounts)*](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035056531)*. *   

If you do not have access to or have forgotten the email address, Java profile name, or password you originally registered a Legacy account with, we may be able to change the email on the account for you to access it. You will then be able to migrate to a Microsoft account by following the steps in our [guide](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4411173197709-How-to-Migrate-a-Legacy-Minecraft-Account-to-a-Microsoft-Account-).

In order to verify account ownership and change the email, please [locate your transaction ID](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360029977371-What-is-a-Transaction-ID-) and then [contact Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). Remember to provide the email address, Java profile name and any other information that you have so that we are better able to assist you.
