If you own Minecraft on one Microsoft account and Minecraft Dungeons on a different account, you can link both accounts to the Minecraft Launcher. You will need to switch between those accounts to access the games following these steps:

1.  Start the Minecraft launcher.
2.  Select your profile in the top-left portion of the screen. If youâ€™re signed in, your account name will display.
3.  Select **View all accounts**.
4.  Select the **Switch Account** button or add a Microsoft account.
