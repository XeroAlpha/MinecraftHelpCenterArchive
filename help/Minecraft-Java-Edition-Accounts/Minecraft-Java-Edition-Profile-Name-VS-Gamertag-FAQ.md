## Gamertags

Gamertags are used for Microsoft accounts only. If you view your Microsoft account online, you will see your Gamertag as your account name, not Minecraft Username. Any purchase information and account settings tied to your Microsoft account will display your Gamertag. You can find your Gamertag by signing into <https://www.xbox.com/en-US/> and checking the top right.   

In this example the Gamertag is MCgtag1.

### Why Do I Need a Gamertag?  

If you have owned an Xbox before you are most likely familiar with Gamertags. If you haven’t, Gamertags are the names you will see in game above player’s heads in multiplayer when playing any Bedrock versions of Minecraft.  

Since Bedrock versions of Minecraft uses Xbox’s account system for multiplayer, you will have a Gamertag even if you do not play on Xbox or Windows 10. On some platforms you may also have a profile name that does not match your Gamertag. 

If you use a Microsoft account to login to Minecraft: Java Edition you will also have a Gamertag associated with your account, however it will not display in-game. Instead, you will see the Java profile name you set up on minecraft.net in-game.  

If you want to change your Gamertag you can do so by logging into your Microsoft account at: <https://www.xbox.com/en-US>  

If you play on a mobile device, you may not have a Gamertag as you do not need to sign into a Microsoft account in order to play. However, if you wish to play online you will need to link a Microsoft account and create a Gamertag. 

### Where can I Find my Java profile name?

When playing Minecraft: Java Edition you will see your Java profile name in-game and not your Gamertag. The only time you will see your Minecraft Java profile name is in-game and in your Minecraft account settings. You will still be able to view and change your Minecraft: Java Edition profile name as usual on [www.minecraft.net](http://www.minecraft.net/). Navigate to your profile by using the dropdown box on the top right of your screen. Select the Minecraft: Java Edition dropdown box and click **Profile Name** to view your in-game Java profile name.

Your profile name will appear in the box below.

## Java profile names

### What are the requirements for creating a Java profile name? 

- Must have 3-16 characters
- No Spaces are allowed between characters

Accepted characters: 

- **A-Z** (upper and lower case)
- **0-9**
- The only special character accepted is **\_** (underscore)

**Note: You can no longer create Java profile names with less than three characters. **

### Can I change my Java profile name? 

Users who have a Microsoft account can change their Java profile name for free at [www.minecraft.net/en-us/profile](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login?return_url=/en-us/profile). Navigate to **My Games** and select the Minecraft: Java Edition dropdown box. 

![blobid1.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6023801543949)

Click on **Profile Name** and you'll be taken to a name change page. Input the new Java profile name you'd like to use and click **Change Profile Name**.

![blobid2.jpg](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6023923635085)

If you have an older account and sign in with your Java profile name, you need to migrate to a Mojang account before changing your Java profile name. Minecraft support is unable to assist with changing Java profile names as the system is set up to be self-service.

### How often can I change my Java profile name? 

You can change your Java profile name once every 30 days. If you attempt to change your Java profile name within that 30-day period, you'll be informed when your last name change was and how many days are left until you can change it again.  

![blobid3.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/6023941382925)

When you change your Java profile name, your previous name is saved for 37 days. This gives you an additional week to change back if you change your mind before your previous Java profile name becomes available to anyone else.** **

### After I changed my Java profile name, I got the error message “not authenticated with Minecraft.net.” What should I do? 

You must log out completely and then log back in. This refreshes your profile's authentication and connection with our servers. 

## How to Log out and log back in 

1.  In the Minecraft game launcher, click your Java profile name or email address in the top right corner.
2.  Click **Log out.**
3.  Log back in with your account credentials.

## If I ban someone on my server and they change their Java profile name, do they remain banned? 

Yes, and the same is true when someone is whitelisted, or has Operator level permissions. Account-level features on an unmodified or “Vanilla” server stay the same because the system is using your profile's unique ID instead of the Java profile name.  

**Note**: This does not include the scoreboard system, which uses Java profile name, and is not meant to store long-term player data. 

## Is there Java profile name moderation? Can I report someone? 

Mojang Studios has always had a moderately relaxed stance on Java profile name. Someone who chooses an inappropriate Java profile name is often banned by the servers that they join. Even though Java profile name changes are now a feature, people have been able to register questionably appropriate Java profile names since 2009, and the community has self-regulated.  

**Note: If you need to report a player for other reasons, please refer to our [Player Reporting FAQ](../Manage-or-Troubleshoot-Realms/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Player-Reporting-FAQ.md).**

Do not report other players' Java profile names to Mojang Studios**; **if you encounter an inappropriate name while playing on a server, please report it to the server owner.**   
**

With that in mind, however, Mojang Studios reserves the right to change offensive names. To remain within our Community Standards, Java profile names may not contain:

- *Discrimination/Slurs against:*
  - A race, ethnicity, skin color
  - Sexual orientation & gender identity
  - Disability
- Any other form of hate speech
- Sexual content
- Hate symbols
- *Promotion of:*
  - Criminal activity/drug use
  - Self-harm/suicide
  - Extreme violence
