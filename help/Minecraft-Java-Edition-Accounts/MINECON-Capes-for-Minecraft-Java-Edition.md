MINECON is an annual fan festival celebrating Minecraft. In the past attendees have received an exclusive in-game cape for the Java Edition of Minecraft. Mojang cape redemption URLs are redeemed on the Mojang account that is currently logged in on your web browser. 

**Mojang does not sell MINECON capes. Minecraft Support does not transfer capes between accounts.**

## Previous Years\' Capes 

We no longer assist users in adding capes from previous years\' MINECONs to accounts. 

In **2011**, capes were automatically attached to ticket-holders\' registered usernames. 

In **2012**, we sent a message to the registered email address containing a link that enabled the addition of a cape to the user\'s profile. If an email was not registered, the message was sent to the email linked to the purchase of the tickets. 

In **2013**, capes were sent as a redemption URL to the email address registered when the ticket was purchased. If someone else purchased the ticket, please contact them for the cape redemption link. Minecraft Support cannot resend cape links or give them to another person. 

In **2015**, capes were sent as a redemption URL to the email address registered to each individual MINECON ticket. If the same email address was registered to all tickets all redemption URLs were sent in one email to that address. 

In **2016**, capes were sent out as redemption URLs to the email address registered to each purchased ticket that was scanned at the event. 

## Other Issues 

If you have more than one type of cape, you can switch which cape you are wearing at your [Minecraft profile](https://minecraft.net/profile).
