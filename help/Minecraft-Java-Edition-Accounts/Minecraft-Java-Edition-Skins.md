## Add an Outer or Second Skin Layer

Starting with Minecraft version 1.8, skins can have a second layer on each body part. Only the inner part of a dual-layer skin will be visible if you use it while playing a Minecraft edition older than version 1.8.

## How to Update Minecraft 

To play the newest content in Minecraft, your game needs to be updated to the most recent version. This should happen automatically while your device is in standby mode or in use while connected to an active Internet connection. However, if you need to manually update your game, you’ll find the instructions for your Minecraft: Java Edition listed below.  

## How do I find my current version number? 

Find the version number on the bottom right of the Minecraft home screen. 

### Minecraft: Java Edition (PC/Mac) 

Open the Minecraft launcher. The launcher should automatically show you the latest release. If not:

1.  Click the arrow to the right of the **Play **button
2.  Select **Latest Release**.
3.  Don’t see the launcher? [Download it](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download).

## Learn about Standard and Slim Skin Models

If you haven’t uploaded a custom skin, you'll have either the classic ["Steve" skin](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/steve.png) or the newer ["Alex" skin](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/alex.png), which features slimmer arms. Your default skin is randomly based on your account ID and cannot be changed, although you can apply custom skins. This skin is also used when you don't have a connection to the skin servers.

You can create your own skin based on either model using the reference templates below:

- [Standard](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/4px_reference.png)
- [Slim](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/3px_reference.png)

Slim-armed skins are only fully supported in version 1.8 and higher; if you have a slim-armed skin selected in a version prior, you will see black pixels on the arms.

To find your version number or instructions on how to update your version, see [How To Update Minecraft](#how-to-update-minecraft).

## Upload a Player Skin for Minecraft: Java Edition

To upload your own skin, download the classic or slim-armed reference skin from the templates linked in the section above and edit it to your liking. Then sign into your Minecraft profile at [minecraft.net/profile](https://minecraft.net/profile) and upload your skin.

## Troubleshooting Minecraft Skins

### Why does the website say that I have to pay to change my skin?

You’ll see this message if you are not currently logged into an account which contains a paid copy of Minecraft: Java Edition. If you can only play the demo, see [Minecraft: Java Edition Demo Mode](../Minecraft-Java-Edition-Technical/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Demo-Mode.md).

### Why don't I see my skin in multiplayer?

If you see the default skin in-game refresh by logging out and back in. If everyone's skins show as the default, the server may be running in offline mode.

### I uploaded a new skin, why didn’t my skin change?

Skin changes in Minecraft version 1.7.9 and later should happen immediately. If you are playing version 1.7.8 or an earlier version, skin changes may take up to an hour to be applied. If you are playing version 1.3 or earlier, skin changes will not be reflected in-game. 

To find your version number or instructions on how to update your version, see [How To Update Minecraft](#how-to-update-minecraft)

### Why are there black lines on my skin's arms?

You'll see black lines on your skin’s arms in versions 1.8 and later if your profile has a classic model selected, but you've uploaded a slim-armed skin. To fix this, visit [Minecraft.net/profile](https://minecraft.net/profile) and upload the correct skin type for the model you've selected.

You'll also see this issue if you've uploaded a slim-armed skin prior to them being implemented in the game (versions 1.7.9 or earlier). To fix this, visit [Minecraft.net/profile](https://minecraft.net/profile) and upload a classic skin.

To find your version number or instructions on how to update your version, see [How To Update Minecraft](#how-to-update-minecraft).
