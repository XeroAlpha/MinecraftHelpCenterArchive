As of December 18, 2023, the post-migration process for Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts for access to Minecraft has officially ended. If you successfully completed the post-migration process, you should now have access to both Java and Bedrock editions with your Microsoft account.

As the migration period has concluded, Minecraft Support will no longer assist with account-related questions. Please visit these pages for help with your Microsoft account:
