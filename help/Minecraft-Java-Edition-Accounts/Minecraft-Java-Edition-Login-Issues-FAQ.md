## Minecraft: Java Edition Account Types  

There are a few different account types associated with Minecraft: Java Edition, and it is important to know the differences when dealing with account issues. The following describes the differences between the [account types](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408867060621-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Account-Types).

Minecraft accounts were the first way to log into Minecraft on a computer, and Mojang accounts were later introduced as a single account to use across all Mojang games. Microsoft accounts became the new account type for all purchases of Minecraft: Java Edition after December 1, 2020.  

### Minecraft Account 

- This account type was the first way to log into Minecraft on a computer.  
- All Minecraft accounts created prior to November 2012 used this account type. 
- **Paid accounts of this type were migrated to Mojang accounts.** 
- Use your email address to log into Minecraft and Mojang Studios services. 
- This account type no longer logs into Minecraft and minecraft.net with a Java profile name. 

###  Mojang Account  

- This account type was introduced as a single account to use across all Mojang games. 
- All Minecraft: Java Edition purchases prior to December 1, 2020, are attached to a Mojang account.  
- If you have [registered a Mojang account](https://account.mojang.com/register), log into the [Minecraft site](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) with your email address.   

### Microsoft Account  

- This account type was introduced when Microsoft acquired Minecraft from Mojang Studios, and all new accounts created after December 2020 use this account type.  
- New purchases of Minecraft: Java Edition are linked to a Microsoft account instead of a Mojang account.  
- When logging into the game or the site, you use a Microsoft account login.  
- When you [make your purchase](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/get-minecraft), you will be prompted to link a Microsoft account. You can then [select a Java profile name](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408950195341-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Username-VS-Gamertag-FAQ) and log into the game using your Microsoft credentials.  

## Unlinking a Minecraft: Java Edition Account and a Microsoft Account   

After you link a Minecraft: Java Edition account to a Microsoft Secure Account (MSA), the accounts are permanently linked and cannot be unlinked. 

If you have purchased Minecraft: Java Edition on the wrong account or otherwise need to change which Microsoft account you made the purchase on, please contact Microsoft for refund support here: **[Request a refund for digital games \| Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders)**

## If you created a Minecraft account prior to November 2012 (legacy account), the following may apply to you:   

### You Had a Legacy or Premium Minecraft Account   

- You have purchased a copy of Minecraft from Minecraft.net.  
- You use your Minecraft Java profile name to log into Minecraft services and can access the full game.  

### You Had an Unpaid Minecraft Account   

- You previously registered a Minecraft Java profile name but did not purchase the game.  
- You use your Minecraft Java profile name to log into Minecraft services but are unable to use services other than Demo mode.  
- **These accounts were deleted in February 2015, and the Java profile names  became available for other players, except those accounts that had purchased a gift code.**  

## FAQs 

### Do I Login With my Email Address or my Java profile name?  

How you log in depends on your account type, either with a Minecraft account, a Mojang account, or a Microsoft account. 

- **Legacy Minecraft accounts** that have not yet been migrated – **login with a Java profile name**. 
- Any account **created after late 2012**, or one that has been migrated from the old account format, is a **Mojang account** - **login with an email address**. 
- **Purchased** Minecraft: Java Edition **after December 1, 2020** - **login with a Microsoft account.** 

### I Forgot my Password  

- To reset the password for a **legacy** **Minecraft account** (where you log in with your Java profile name) you need to select 'Forgot Password' from the Minecraft Launcher.
- To reset the password for a **Mojang account** (where you log in with your email address) visit the [Forgot Password](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/password/forgot/) page.  
- To reset the password for a **Microsoft account** visit the  [forgotten password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/reset-a-forgotten-microsoft-account-password-eff4f067-5042-c1a3-fe72-b04d60556c37) guide from Microsoft.  

### I Forgot the Email Address Used for my Account

- For a **Mojang account** and have forgotten the email that you log in with, [try resetting your password](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/password/forgot/). The reset process will send an email to the address that you have registered, letting you know which address you used. Alternatively, try other email addresses that you own. 
- If you forget or no longer have access to an email address you might have used, contact  [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). 
- If you cannot get Mojang system emails, visit the [Cannot Get Mojang System Emails](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034636412) page.  
- If you have a **Microsoft account** and forgot your email, contact [Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus).  

### I Need to Change the Email Address Used for my Account  

- For a **Minecraft account**, you will need to migrate it to change the email address. To learn how to do this, please visit [Changing Your Email Address](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034636992).  
- For a **Mojang account**, visit the [Mojang Studios Account](https://account.mojang.com/me/settings) login page. You can either have instructions sent to your current address or, if you don't have access to that email, you can have it changed by passing a [security challenge](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408866406541-Mojang-Account-Security-Questions-FAQ).  
- For a **Microsoft account**, please contact [Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus).  

### I Remember my Email Address, But Not my Java profile name

- For legacy **Minecraft accounts**, you log in with your Java profile name instead of an email. If you have a legacy account and forgot your username, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).  
- For a **Mojang account**, your Minecraft Java profile name will be shown in-game, on your Mojang account page or on the launcher itself.  
- For **Microsoft account**, your Minecraft Java profile name will be shown in-game, on your account page or on the launcher itself. [Microsoft account page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/profile) 

### I’m Getting an Error That Says “Login failed: Invalid Java profile name or password" 

If you're logging into the Minecraft game client and you see the error message "Login failed. Invalid Java profile name or password” 

Some options you can try:  

- This can be a temporary issue and waiting 30 minutes to 1 hour before attempting to log in again may solve the problem.    
- You may need to change your password to something you haven't previously used. If you need to reset your password, see: [I Forgot my Password](#iforgot-my-password). 

**Note: ** Changing your password multiple times will not resolve the issue.  

If your attempts to log in are unsuccessful multiple times, and you have already changed your password, you might have to wait 24 hours before the account can be authenticated again. If your problem is not resolved after 24 hours, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).  

**Note**: If you see a technical error message when you try to log in to the launcher, visit our [technical Help resources](../Minecraft-Java-Edition-Technical/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Troubleshooting.md).   

### I’m Having Trouble with my Security Questions 

You can reset your security questions from your [Mojang account settings](https://account.mojang.com/me/settings). Then follow the instructions sent to the email registered to your Mojang account.  

If you do not receive the email to reset your security questions, check our list of reasons why you  [Cannot Receive Mojang System Emails](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034636412-Cannot-Get-Mojang-System-Emails).  

If you continue to have problems with resetting your security questions, contact [Minecraft Support ](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support)with proof of account ownership. This can be your [transaction ID or gift code](../General-Billing/What-is-a-Transaction-ID.md).  

### I Need to Change or Recover my Registered Email Address  

To change or recover your email address, visit one of the following sites, depending on your account type:  

- [Mojang account](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035056531-Changing-Your-Email-Address-Mojang-Accounts-)  
- [Legacy Minecraft account](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034636992-Changing-Your-Email-Address-Legacy-Minecraft-Accounts-)  
- [Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus)  

If you're not sure which account type you have, see:  [Minecraft: Java Edition Account Types](#minecraft-java-edition-account-types) at the top of this article.  

### I’m not receiving emails from Mojang Studios  

If you have problems receiving emails, check the following:   

- Confirm that the email you are using is the same one you used to make your account.   
- Make sure there are no typos in your email address to confirm it is being sent to a valid address.   
- Check your junk email or spam folder for verification emails. If Mojang Studios emails have been marked as spam at any point, these emails may end up in your junk email or spam folder  
- Make sure your email address has been verified.  

#### Verify Your Email Address  

1.  Log in to your account and click on your email address in the top right corner of the page.   
2.  Click **VERIFY THIS ACCOUNT**.  
3.  On the verification page, click **Request a new code**.  
4.  Check your email for the notification message and follow the instructions to verify your email account.  

**Tip:** If you don’t see the email message, check your junk/spam email folder.    
  

If your account was compromised and the email used with this account was changed, or if you are still unable to access your account, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support) for assistance.   

### I Can’t Log In to My Mojang Account  

Make sure you are logging in with your correct Java profile name and password. If you have forgotten your password, see: [I Forgot my Password](#iforgot-my-password) above to reset it by entering your email.   

### My Java profile name and Password are Correct, But I Still Can’t Login   

- Check your Internet connection to verify internet access.   
- Check to see if Minecraft services are currently down. If this is the case, wait and try logging in again later.    
- Check for any service updates or outages. 
- Check [@MojangStatus](https://twitter.com/MojangStatus?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) on Twitter. 

If you still cannot log in, you may require further assistance. See: [Having trouble accessing your account?](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360029681732-Having-trouble-accessing-your-account-) for more suggestions.  

If you still cannot resolve the issue or you need assistance in changing account information,

contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).   

### Encountering an Error While Creating Your Account 

When signing up for an account and creating a Java profile name you may see this error: *IllegalArgumentException: Registration failed*.  

![blobid0.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409162286861)

This error occurs when a registered account already exists with the Java profile name you have selected. Normally the site will tell you the name is already taken, but in some instances, this

error will show instead. You will need to select a new Java profile name and try again.  

If you are still having issues selecting a unique name, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). 

### Forgot Password and Don’t Have Access to Your Original Account Email  

The Minecraft team can help! We will need an alternate form of verification to make sure that you own the account. The most helpful is the [transaction ID](../General-Billing/What-is-a-Transaction-ID.md) you received when you purchased the game.  

Please keep in mind that this process applies specifically to Mojang and Minecraft accounts. If you are having trouble with a Sony account, Microsoft account, Nintendo account, or another account you will need to contact the relevant support channel.  

Here are a few support sites:  

- [Apple](https://support.apple.com/)  
- [Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en#topic=3364260)  
- [Microsoft](https://beta.support.xbox.com/)  
- [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/assets/region_select.jsp)  
- [PlayStation®](https://support.playstation.com/s/?language=en_US)  

### Send us what you can : 

The **Java Account Email** box (highlighted in blue) is for the email currently on your Minecraft: Java Edition Account. Enter this information to the best of your knowledge.  

You must include a **Transaction ID** or we may be unable to proceed. If you are unsure of what a Transaction ID looks like or have forgotten it, see [What is a Transaction ID?](../General-Billing/What-is-a-Transaction-ID.md)  

If you have lost access to the account email address, in the* ***Your Email Address** box (highlighted in red) include a new email so that we may respond back to you.   

**IMPORTANT** Tell us in your email message that this is not the primary email associated with the account and that you need help locating it.    

![blobid1.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409154967309)

As always, we appreciate your continued support and enthusiasm for the games we create.   

### I Can Only Play the Demo  

We explain why in our article, [Minecraft: Java Edition Demo Mode.](../Minecraft-Java-Edition-Technical/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Demo-Mode.md)

### I Changed Computers, my Account Is Gone  

We often receive emails from players who believe that, after changing computers, they have lost their Minecraft Java profile name or game. However, you can access your Minecraft account from anywhere where you have a copy of the game, or an internet connection to play from minecraft.net, regardless of which computer you play on. You cannot have a Minecraft profile deleted by playing on a different computer.  

If your worlds are gone after changing computers, that is because world files are saved locally to the  computer where they are created rather than being saved on your account.

If you want to know how to move your worlds from one computer to another, please visit our help article, Transferring Minecraft: Java Edition to Another Computer.  

If you are having trouble logging in and are being asked to answer questions, visit our article on  [Account Security Questions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408866406541-Mojang-Account-Security-Questions-FAQ).  

If you think that your account has been compromised, visit [My Account was Stolen](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409227755661-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Account-Security-FAQ).  

If you cannot log in, make sure that you are typing your email or Java profile name exactly as you had it before. Note any underscores, letters replaced by numbers, or characters that look like other characters. If you are having trouble with your password, see: [I Forgot My Password](#iforgot-my-password) information in this article according to your account type.

After trying these options, if you are still unable to log in, you can contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support) for more help.  

### I've Tried the Above, but I Still Need Help
