Buying and selling Minecraft accounts goes against our Terms of Service and we are unable to provide support for accounts that were purchased from resellers or third-party sites. Ultimately, we consider the person who initially created an account to be the owner of that account, so purchasing from a 3rd party seller will not make you the legitimate owner. 

For more detail on the specifics, see our [Terms of Service](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula).
