Buying and selling Minecraft accounts goes against our Terms of Service and we are unable to provide support for licenses that were purchased from resellers or third-party sites. Ultimately, we consider the person who initially created an account to be the owner of that account, so purchasing from a third-party seller will not make you the legitimate owner. 

For more information about usage of Minecraft licenses, please refer to these pages:
