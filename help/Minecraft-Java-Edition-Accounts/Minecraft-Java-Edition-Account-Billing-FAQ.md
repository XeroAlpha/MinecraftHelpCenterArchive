## Account Billing Issues 

Mojang works with our payment partners to counteract reported fraudulent purchases. Once a suspicious purchase is confirmed, we refund the charges at the request of the partner; as a result, the game profile is flagged for deletion. 

### How do I check on my account?  

If you think that you have lost access to your game, you can check by visiting [My Account (microsoft.com)](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/).

### Who do I contact about this?  

If your game has been refunded, and you bought it through Mojang, contact your bank, credit card company, or PayPal, to see what may have triggered the refund. 

### Can I get a refund for a code from a reseller site? 

If you bought a code online through a re-seller website, we are unable to assist you as re-selling codes violates our [terms of service](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula). We provide refunds only when required to do so or at the request of the original buyer per our [refund policy](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030463592-Mojang-refunds-policy). 

### Can I restore my account?  

Yes! If you repurchase the game and select the same Java profile name, it will remove the deletion flag for your Java profile name and restore your access to it. If you have trouble with this process, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).  

## Saved Payment Information 

When purchasing games from the Microsoft Store, you have the option to save payment details to your account for future use. When you make a purchase, it is transmitted to our servers over a secure connection.

Because this information is encrypted, neither Mojang Studios nor Microsoft have direct access to your credit card details. This information can be sent to our payment partners to process a transaction but cannot be read by us. This means that if your Microsoft account were to be compromised, your card details would not be at risk.

### Remove Payment Details 

You can remove your payment details at any time from your [Microsoft account settings](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/).

### Change a Saved Payment Card 

A saved credit card is required for recurring purchases, such as monthly payments of Minecraft Realms. If you\'d like to switch the card that is set up for recurring payments, delete the currently saved card, then add a new card to your profile.

## I was charged but did not receive the game 

If you see a pending charge on your account and you did not receive an e-mail with a [transaction ID](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360029977371-What-is-a-Transaction-ID-) or the game, then your payment has failed. When this happens, a temporary hold is placed on the funds required for your purchase. In rare cases, you might also see more than one pending charge in your account. No need to worry. Any pending charges should drop from your account as soon as your bank or card provider processes the transaction. Any held funds will be returned to your account.  

If you still wish to purchase the game, you can try your purchase again or view other [purchasing options](http://www.minecraft.net/store). If you are using Internet Explorer, we suggest trying your purchase with Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or on a mobile device.  

If you continue to have issues with the online payment system, check with your bank or credit card company, as some banks do not allow international purchases. If you are unable to make a purchase online, you may want to visit your local retailer in person to purchase Minecraft prepaid cards.  

If you have more than one confirmed purchase, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support) within 15 days of purchase, and they will be more than happy to refund those extra charges. Be sure to include the transaction ID of any duplicate charges, or else we will not be able to refund the purchase.  

## I bought the wrong version of Minecraft 

There are two versions of Minecraft for PC. Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft for Windows. Both versions can be downloaded from the [Official Minecraft website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) and are now available through the Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC initiative. If you purchase one version of the game, you get the other for free! 

## Crossplay With Other Platforms or Consoles 

Although** **you will see both Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft for Windows offered for Windows PCs, the two editions are not compatible and have a few differences. To cross-play with any other consoles or platforms, you need Minecraft for Windows. Make sure you  investigate each version to determine which is right for your personal needs.  

## Change the Version Purchased 

If you buy Minecraft: Java Edition, you\'ve also purchased Minecraft: Bedrock Edition thanks to our Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition bundle. You can now download both versions of the game and switch between them at your leisure. 

## I still have questions about my Minecraft: Java Edition account; where can I get more help? 

Sure, we\'d love to help! Contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support) with your [transaction ID](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360029977371-What-is-a-Transaction-ID-), and we will be happy to assist.
