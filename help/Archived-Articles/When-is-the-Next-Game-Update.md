Game updates usually happen when the developers feel that they\'re playable, fun, and ready for release. 

For Minecraft: Java Edition there are snapshots listed on our [home page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) showcasing upcoming features before the final release. For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on certain devices you can try [Minecraft Preview](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4423653831821).  

**Note: If the information hasn\'t already been posted publicly, we cannot give you a release date. **

You can keep track of updates at [Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition).
