**Hello dear friends, the sun has set for the last time on Minecraft Earth. Minecraft Earth has shut down as of June 30, 2021. ** 

Due to the current global situation, we have made the difficult decision to sunset Minecraft Earth. By doing this we are freeing up resources that allow for more adventures, more fun, and more resources to be poured into the Minecraft community. 

Character creator items remain on players’ accounts and are usable in Bedrock versions of Minecraft.  

Thank you for your devotion to Minecraft Earth. We enjoyed seeing your creations and adventures. Enjoy your character creator items in Minecraft and show the rest of the Minecraft community your spoils. We hope to see you in Minecraft soon!

As the final curtain has come down and the game is no longer accessible, Minecraft Support is no longer able to assist with Minecraft Earth issues.
