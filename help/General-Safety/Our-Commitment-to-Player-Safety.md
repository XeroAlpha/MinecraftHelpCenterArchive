We hold ourselves accountable for making Minecraft as safe as possible for everyone.

Our games bring millions of players together from all over the world, all united by the goal of crafting, exploring, and having fun.  That’s why it’s so important that our games are a safe and welcoming place for all players.

## Player Safety

The goal of Player Safety is to enable players to enjoy an online game and express themselves while being safe from abuse and other harmful behaviors. Player Safety includes technical and human approaches, tools, and processes.

Versions of Minecraft earlier than 1.16.4 don’t include safety features. We recommended that you update to the latest version of the game to take advantage of the newest security fixes and player safety updates, gameplay optimizations, and other great stuff.

## Account Security

Since the migration of all Minecraft and Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts, both Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition game clients benefit from increased account security, including the ability to [activate two-factor authentication](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/how-to-use-two-step-verification-with-your-microsoft-account-c7910146-672f-01e9-50a0-93b4585e7eb4), which makes it much harder for intruders to access your account.

## Parental Controls

Microsoft accounts benefit from parental controls that empower parents to choose which community and purchasing features kids can access in Minecraft online experiences, including which online games they can access, who can they chat with, and what they can buy.

For information about configuring parental controls, visit [Managing Multiplayer Game Access For A Child Account In Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md).

## Community Guidelines

To ensure players have the same inclusive and welcoming game experience when playing any of our games under the Minecraft franchise, we leverage the Community Standards for[ Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards) and [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/legal/community-standards).

They set the tone and values of the expected experiences and interactions in our games.

## Proactive Moderation

For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition Realms as well as partnered and verified Bedrock servers, we leverage an automated proactive chat filtering system.

We use it to classify, filter, and escalate online harms for human review and moderation to promote safe and welcoming interactions on Minecraft games. That includes behaviors such as harassment, abuse, and hate speech.

## Player Abuse Reporting

The goal of having effective and intuitive Player Reporting mechanisms in our games is to empower the community to let us know when harmful behavior is taking place and getting in the way of the fun and intended experiences in Minecraft.

Visit the below articles to learn how to report players in either Bedrock or Java:

- [How to Report a Player in Minecraft: Java Edition](../Player-Reporting-Bans/How-to-Report-a-Player-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md)

If you are aware of a server that is violating our Community Guidelines, [you can report them here](http://aka.ms/mce-reportserver).

For Minecraft servers that are safe to join and fun for all ages, check out [our official Minecraft server listing site](https://findmcserver.com/).

## Human Moderation

To facilitate a safe and welcoming community for our players, we have a team of dedicated and passionate moderators and investigators that work in partnership with Xbox’s Gaming Safety Team. This team is empowered with specialized knowledge of the Minecraft community and gaming environment, to review user-generated content and act on verified instances of unwelcoming, harmful, or in some cases, dangerous content.

We understand that all of us can learn from our experiences and mistakes. That’s why we are focused on creating systems that guide players to better understand our community guidelines and the intended in-game experiences. We want our players to continue playing Minecraft in a safe way.

Of course, no system is a perfect system, which is why on this player safety journey, we will continue to learn and grow with our community.
