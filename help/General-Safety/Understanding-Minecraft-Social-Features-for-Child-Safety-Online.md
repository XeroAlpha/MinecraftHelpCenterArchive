Minecraft contains many ways players can communicate with each other. Some communication channels are monitored by automated software systems, and some are moderated by Minecraft to support our commitment to player safety. Setting up [Microsoft family groups](../Resources-for-Families/Set-Up-Microsoft-Family-Groups-for-Parental-Controls-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) enables controls for chat and social features allowed for a child account, and which groups can see a child account’s information.

## Communication Methods in Minecraft

- **Chat**: Players can activate the Chat screen and type messages to each other by hitting \[Return\] or \[T\] while playing Minecraft. Typed messages appear on the game screen after they are entered.
- **Signs and Banners**: Players can craft signs and banners and type up to four lines of text to be displayed. Signs are visible to anyone who plays in the same world.
- **Book and Quill**: Players can craft a book and quill that allows them to write down experiences, create narratives, or take notes. Books can be read by anyone who finds or creates one in-game.
- **Skins and Usernames**: Players can create their own username and custom skins with words and logos on them to decorate their in-game characters. Skins and user names must follow the [Community Standards for Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards) or they [can be banned](../Player-Reporting-Bans/Update-Banned-Skins-or-Usernames-in-Minecraft.md).

## Safety Features for Communication

- **Profanity Filter**: The Filter Profanity toggle in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition under Settings \> General is on by default and cannot be turned off when signed in using a child account. When a chat, sign, book, or other typed message with inappropriate content is posted, the profanity filter either replaces inappropriate words with hashtags (#) or completely hides the message from other players. The profanity filter in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is active on Realms, partner servers, and other multiplayer experiences. The profanity filter is only active on Realms if you’re playing Minecraft: Java Edition.
- **Moderation**: When playing in a Realm in either Minecraft: Java Edition or Minecraft: Bedrock edition, text communications are monitored for appropriate interaction. Moderation also applies to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Partner Servers available in-game. Inappropriate communications can lead to [player accounts being banned](../Player-Reporting-Bans/Banned-Minecraft-Accounts-and-the-Appeal-Process.md) from playing Minecraft. Moderation in private servers is controlled by the server owner.
- **Chat Access Controls**: You can manage child account access to chat using the [Xbox settings online](../Account-Settings/Managing-Child-Account-Social-Settings-Using-Xbox-Settings-Online.md) or the [Xbox Family app](../Account-Settings/Managing-Child-Account-Social-Settings-Using-the-Xbox-Family-App.md).
