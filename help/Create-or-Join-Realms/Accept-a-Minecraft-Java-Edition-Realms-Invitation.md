*For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, see [Accept a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms Invitation](./Accept-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-invitation.md).*

To join a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm, you’ll need an invitation—see [Invite Friends to Your Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](./Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md) for how to get one. Here’s how to accept the invitation through the Minecraft Realms menu.

## Accept a Minecraft: Java Edition Realms invitation in game

1.  Launch Minecraft: Java Edition.
2.  Select **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Select the **Letter** icon at the top of the screen to see your invites.
4.  Accept the invite by selecting **the green checkmark**.

Now that you’ve accepted the Realms invite, you can join it for any future play session by following the instructions to [Join a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](./Join-a-Friend-s-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md).
