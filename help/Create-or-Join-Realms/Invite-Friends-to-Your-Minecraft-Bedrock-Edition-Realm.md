Realms allow members to play multiplayer Worlds even if the host is not available. While you can invite as many players as you’d like to your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm, only a certain number can be online in your realm at one time based on your Realms subscription.

## Invite friends to a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm in Minecraft

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the **Realms** tab.
4.  Select a Realm and click the **Options** button.
5.  Click the **Manage Realm** button.
6.  Click the **Members** button.
7.  Find friends and invite them to your Realm.

## Invite friends to a Minecraft: Bedrock Realm on Minecraft.net

1.  Sign in with your [Microsoft account on Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login).
2.  Select **All Games**.
3.  Click the link for your Realm under the Realms heading for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
4.  Find friends and invite them to your Realm.

## Invite options for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms

You have several options for how you can invite friends to your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm:

- **Xbox Live friends list:** Click the **Invite** button next to names already on your Xbox friends list to give them access to your Realm.
- **Find friends:** Search for players by their gamertag associated with their Microsoft account and add them to your Friends list.
- **Invite Links:** Create a link unique to your Realm. When you share a link, your friends will see your Realm’s information and your gamertag in a browser. From there, they can open Minecraft or copy the Invite Code to use later.

## Manage Realms Visitors

Anyone who has access to the link can join your Realm. If you are seeing unwanted players in your Realm, here’s what you can do:

- **Generate a new Share Link:** Generating a new link will deactivate the old one so it can’t be used to join your Realm.
- **Remove or block players:** See [How to Moderate Your Minecraft Realm](../Manage-Realms-Settings-Worlds/Moderate-Your-Minecraft-Realm.md) for more information.
