*For Minecraft: Java Edition, see* [Invite Friends to Your Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](./Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md)*.*

After you [Create a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](./Create-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md), you can invite your friends to play from the Minecraft game menu.

**Note**: while you can invite as many players as you’d like to your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm, only a certain number can be online simultaneously based on your Realms subscription. See a comparison of plans at [Minecraft.net/realms](https://minecraft.net/realms).

## Invite friends to your Realm through the Minecraft game menu

1.  Select **Play** from the Minecraft launch screen.
2.  Select the **Realms** tab on the Play menu.
3.  Select the desired Realm and select the **Options** button.
4.  Select **Realm settings** from the Options menu.
5.  Select the **Manage Realm** button.
6.  Select **Members** or **Invite Links** from the Manage Realm menu.

On the Members tab, you can find friends using their gamertag and send invitations. On the Invite Links tab, you can generate and activate an [Invite Link](../Manage-Realms-Settings-Worlds/Manage-Invite-Links-for-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms.md) to share with multiple players via email or messaging.

You can also [sign into your profile on Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile) and invite members from the Realms tab.
