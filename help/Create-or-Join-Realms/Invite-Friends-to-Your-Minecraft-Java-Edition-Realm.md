*For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, see* *[Invite Friends to Your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](./Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).*

After you [create a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](./Create-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md), you can invite your friends through the Minecraft game menu.

**Note**: while you can invite as many players as you’d like to your Minecraft: Java Edition Realm, only 10 can be online simultaneously.

## Invite friends through the game menu

1.  Select **Minecraft Realms** from the Minecraft launch screen.
2.  Select your Realm and then select the **Configure **button.
3.  Select **Players** and then select **Invite Player**.
4.  Enter the player's [Java Profile Name](../Manage-Your-Minecraft-Profile/View-or-Change-Your-In-Game-Profile-Name-in-Minecraft.md) and select the **Invite Player** button.

You can also [sign into your profile on Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile) and invite members from the Realms tab.
