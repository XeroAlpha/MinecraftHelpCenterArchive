If you own a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm, you may see improved performance by setting a server region preference. Choosing a server region near you and friends can help reduce lag.

## **How to set your Minecraft: Java Edition Realm server region preference**

1.  Launch Minecraft: Java Edition and select **Minecraft Realms**.
2.  Select your Realm and select **Configure**.
3.  Select the **Settings** tab.
4.  Select **Select Region…**.
5.  Select a server region preference and select Done.

The following options are available:

- **Automatic, first to join session:** The server will be closest to the first player to join.
- **Automatic, Realm owner ping**: The server will be closest to the owner’s location.
- **Specific Region**: The server will be hosted in the selected location.

If you do not set a preference, the Realm server location is automatically chosen based on the first player to join.  All selections are preferences and various circumstances may result in your Realm being hosted in a different region than what you selected. In these cases, we will always attempt to put you in the next best region.
