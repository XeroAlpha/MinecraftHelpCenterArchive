Minecraft Realms is a multiplayer service that enables you to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition online with up to ten of your friends. Before your adventure can begin, you need to join the Realm. Here's how.

## Join a Realm in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play** on the launch screen.
3.  Select the **Realms** tab.
4.  Select a Realm from the list and select **Play**.

Realms only appear if you are the Realm owner or have been invited by the Realm owner. If you don't see any Realms in your list, you will need to have the Realm owner send you an invitation to join. See [Invite Friends to your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](./Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).

## How to find your pending Realm invites

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select** Settings**.
3.  Select **Account**.
4.  Select **Manage Realms membership invites**.
5.  Accept the invite to the Realm you want to join.

After you accept a Realm invite, it will be available for you to join in the Friends tab using the steps above. Make sure that you have the [latest public release of the game](../Download-Install/How-to-Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Mobile.md#h_01FFGQHMP7SE5T5JQHB3068226).

**Note:** If you’re playing on a child account and encountering an error when trying to join a Realm, refer to [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md).

For Realms troubleshooting, please refer to [Minecraft Realms Connection Troubleshooting](../Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Realms/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Realms-Connection-Errors.md).
