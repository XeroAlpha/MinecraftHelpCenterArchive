Minecraft Realms is a multiplayer service that enables you to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition online with up to ten of your friends. Before your adventure can begin, you need to join the Realm. Here is how.

## How to Join a Realm in Bedrock

From the Friends tab on the Play screen in Minecraft, you can view a list of Realms that are available to you. Joining a Realm requires an invitation through a direct invitation or via an invite link. For more on inviting someone to a Realm, please refer to [How to Invite Friends to Your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](./How-to-Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).

## How to find your pending Realm invites

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Under **General** select **Account**.
4.  Select **Manage Realms Membership Invites**.
5.  Accept the invite to the Realm you want to join.

After you accept a Realm invite, it will be available for you to join in the **Friends** tab. Make sure that you have the latest public release of the game.

**Note:** If you’re playing on a child account and encountering an error when trying to join a Realm, refer to [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md).

For Realms troubleshooting, please refer to [Minecraft Realms Connection Troubleshooting](../Manage-or-Troubleshoot-Realms/Minecraft-Realms-Connection-Troubleshooting.md).
