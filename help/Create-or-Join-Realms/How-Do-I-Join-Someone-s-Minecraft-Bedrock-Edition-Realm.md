Minecraft Realms is a multiplayer service that enables you to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition online with two or up to ten of your friends. For more information, check out [Minecraft.net/Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms).  

## How to Join a Realm in Bedrock

From the Friends tab on the Play screen in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, you can view a list of Realms that are available to you. Joining a Realm requires an invitation through a direct invitation or via an invite link. For more on inviting someone to a Realm, please refer to [this article](./How-to-Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).

**How to find your pending Realm invites**

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Under **General** select **Account**.
4.  Select **Manage Realms membership invites**.
5.  Accept the invite to the Realm you want to join.

After you accept a Realm invite, it will be available for you to join. Make sure that you have the [latest public release of the game](../Download-Install/How-to-Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Mobile.md#h_01FFGQHMP7SE5T5JQHB3068226).

## Trouble accepting invites or joining Realms

If you’re having trouble accepting a Realm invite or joining a Realm that you’ve already been invited to, ensure that you are not using a modded game client and are using a resource pack that contains textures for the Realm. 

To check which resource pack you’re using, switch to the standard Minecraft game client and follow these steps: 

1.  Select **Settings.**
2.  Select **Global Resources.**

**Note: If you’re playing on a child account and encountering an error when trying to join a Realm, refer to [this article](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md).**

## Leaving a Realm

If you'd like to leave a Realm, do the following steps:

1.  Go to the Friends tab of the Play screen.
2.  Click the **X** button next to the Realm you want to leave.
3.  Confirm you want to leave that Realm.
