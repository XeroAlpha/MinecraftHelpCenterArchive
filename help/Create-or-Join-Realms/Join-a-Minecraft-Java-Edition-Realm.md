*For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, see [Join a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](./Join-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).*

After you [Accept a Minecraft: Java Edition Realms Invitation](./Accept-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realms-Invitation.md), it will appear on your list of available Realms. You can join the Realms server even if the host isnâ€™t online, and a Realms subscription is not necessary for the player joining.

*For the best experience with Realms, make sure you meet the [Requirements to Play Minecraft Multiplayer Games](../Multiplayer-Support/Requirements-to-Play-Minecraft-Multiplayer-Games.md). We recommend not using any mods.*

## Join a Realm in Minecraft: Java Edition

1.  Launch Minecraft: Java Edition.
2.  Click **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Select an available Realm from the list.
4.  Click the **Play** button to enter the Realm.
