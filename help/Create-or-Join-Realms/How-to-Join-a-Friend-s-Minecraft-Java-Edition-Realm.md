The Minecraft Realms menu in Java Edition lets you view your Realm invitations and the Realms you can join. If you don’t own a Realm, you’ll need to get an invitation to join from the Realm owner. For the best experience with Realms, we recommend updating to the latest version of Minecraft and not using any mods.

## How to accept a Realm invitation in Minecraft: Java Edition

After you receive an invite to a Java Realm, you can accept it by doing the following:

1.  Start Minecraft: Java Edition.
2.  Click **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Select the **Letter** icon at the top of the screen.
4.  Accept the invite.

## How to join a Realm in Minecraft Java Edition

After you accept an invitation to join a Realm or start your own Realm, here’s how to enter and play:

1.  Start Minecraft: Java Edition.
2.  Click **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Select an available Realm from the list.
4.  Click the **Play** button to enter the Realm.
