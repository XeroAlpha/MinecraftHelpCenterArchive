Realms are a great way to play Minecraft with your friends. An active Realms subscription will allow your friends to join the world and play without you needing to be online. Here is how you can create your own Java Realm.

## Starting a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm

Before you go about starting a Realm, make sure you have a Microsoft account to manage your payments for the subscription. If you donâ€™t have one, you can [create a Microsoft account here](https://account.microsoft.com/account/CreateAccount).

1.  Sign in with your Microsoft account on [Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile).
2.  Select **My Realms**.
3.  Select **Buy Now** next to Java Realms subscription.
4.  Agree to the EULA and follow the steps to set up your payment.

After your subscription is active, you can manage it on your [Microsoft subscriptions page](https://account.microsoft.com/services?fref=home.drawers.subscriptions.view-all-subscriptions). For more Realms management, see the below articles:
