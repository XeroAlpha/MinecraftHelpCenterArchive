From the Minecraft Realms menu in Minecraft, you can view a list of Realms that are available to you. Each Realm that you join first requires an invitation, indicated by the flashing mail icon. After you accept it, that player's Realm will be available to you. Make sure that you have the latest public release of the game.

See [How To Invite Friends To Your Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](./How-to-Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md) to learn how to get your friends in your Realm.

## How to join a Realm in Java

After you receive an invite to a Java Realm, you can accept it by doing the following:

1.  Start Minecraft: Java Edition.
2.  Select **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Select the **Pending Invites** button (the letter icon).
4.  Accept the invite.

If you're having trouble accepting invites or joining Realms, please make sure that you are not using a modded game client and are using a resource pack that contains textures for the Realm buttons. If this is the case, switch to the standard Minecraft game client, select **Options**, and then **Resource Packs**, and then return to the default.

## How to leave a Java Realm

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Highlight the Realm and select **Leave Realm**.

If you own the Realm, you must cancel your subscription and wait for the time on it to run out. [See How Do I Cancel A Minecraft: Java Edition Realm Subscription?](../Manage-Realms-Subscriptions/How-Do-I-Cancel-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm-Subscription.md)
