From the Minecraft Realms menu in Minecraft, you can view a list of Realms that are available to you. Each Realm that you join first requires an invitation, indicated by the flashing mail icon. After you accept it, that player's Realm will be available to you. For the best experience with Realms, we recommend updating to the latest version of Minecraft and not using any mods.

## How to join a Realm in Java

After you receive an invite to a Java Realm, you can accept it by doing the following:

1.  Start Minecraft: Java Edition.
2.  Select **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Select the **Pending Invites** button (the letter icon).
4.  Accept the invite.

See [How to Invite Friends to Your Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](./How-to-Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md) to learn how to get your friends in your Realm.
