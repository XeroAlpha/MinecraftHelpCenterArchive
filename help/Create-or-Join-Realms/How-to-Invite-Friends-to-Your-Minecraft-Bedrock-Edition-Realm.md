Minecraft is better when played with friends! That's especially true for Realms, which allow members to play on the server even if the host is not available. Here is how to get your friends involved in your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm.

## Where to invite friends to a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the **Manage Realm** icon (box with a checkmark in it) next to your Realm.
4.  Select **Manage Realm**.
5.  Go to the **Members** section.

From here you have a few options to choose:

### Xbox Live friends list

You’ll see a list of your Xbox Live friends with an Invite button next to their names. Click **Invite** to give them access to your Realm. After you invite friends to join your Realm, they need to accept the invitation for your Realm to show up in their list.

### Find friends

The **Find Friends** button lets you search for players by their gamertag. A gamertag is the character name that appears within Minecraft and is associated with your Microsoft account. Using **Find Friends** adds the person to your Xbox Live friends list if they are not on there already. After finding and adding a friend, you can click **Invite** next to their name.

### Share link

The **Share Link** button generates a link you can send to others or post somewhere, like in a group chat, for players to join your Realm. When your friend clicks this link, it will open a page in a browser letting them see your Realm’s information and your gamertag. If they have Minecraft installed, they can launch the game directly from here and join the Realm.

#### Managing Realms Visitors

Be careful about where you post a share link to your Realm. Anyone who has access to the link can join your Realm. If you use social media to invite your friends, we recommend doing it through direct message. If you are seeing unwanted players in your Realm, here’s what you can do:

- Generate a new Share Link. Generating a new link will deactivate the old one so it can’t be used to join your Realm.
- Remove or block unwanted players from your Realm. See [How to Moderate Your Minecraft Realm](../Manage-Realms-Settings-Worlds/How-to-Moderate-Your-Minecraft-Realm.md) for more information.

## How to invite friends to a Bedrock Realm on Minecraft.net

1.  Sign in with your [Microsoft account on Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login).
2.  Select **All Games**.
3.  On the Minecraft Bedrock Edition card, select your Realm under the **Realms** heading.
4.  Under **Invite Members**, type your friend's Gamertag in the **Filter friends** field.
5.  Press the **Invite** button on the friend you'd like to invite.

**Note:** While you can invite as many players as you’d like to a Minecraft Realm, only a certain amount can be online in your realm at one time. That number is based on your Realms subscription.
