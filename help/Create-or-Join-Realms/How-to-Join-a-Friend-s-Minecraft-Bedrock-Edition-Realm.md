Minecraft Realms is a multiplayer service that enables you to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition online with up to ten of your friends. Before your adventure can begin, you need to join the Realm. Here is how.

## How to Join a Realm in Bedrock

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select Settings.
3.  Select the Friends tab.

From here, you can see any Realms you are currently apart of. If you see nothing in here, you will need to accept an invite from the host.

## How to find your pending Realm invites

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select** Settings**.
3.  Under** General** select **Account**.
4.  Select **Manage Realms membership invites**.
5.  Accept the invite to the Realm you want to join.

After you accept a Realm invite, it will be available for you to join in the Friends tab using the steps above. Make sure that you have the [latest public release of the game](../Download-Install/How-to-Manually-Update-Minecraft-on-Mobile.md#h_01FFGQHMP7SE5T5JQHB3068226).

**Note:** If you’re playing on a child account and encountering an error when trying to join a Realm, refer to [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md).

For Realms troubleshooting, please refer to [Minecraft Realms Connection Troubleshooting](../Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Realms/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Realms-Connection-Errors.md).
