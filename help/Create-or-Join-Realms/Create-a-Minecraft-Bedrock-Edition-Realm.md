Minecraft Realms are a great way to play with friends and share your favorite worlds. Realms worlds are always online, so the host doesn't need to be present for other people to play. Visit [Minecraft Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms) to learn more about subscription options and watch tutorials about managing Realms.

Here is how to subscribe and create a new Realm:

## Starting a Realm on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select the **Play** button.
3.  Select **Create New**.
4.  Choose **Create New World** (or select an existing template).
5.  Select **Create on Realms**.
6.  Select a Realm size.
7.  Select **Subscribe Now**.
8.  Name your Realm.
9.  Check **I Agree** under the Terms and Conditions tab.
10. Select **Subscribe Now \[Price\]/Month**.
11. You’ll be taken to the platform store to complete your purchase.

**Note:** If you are a Marketplace Pass subscriber, you can upgrade to a Realms Plus subscription. However, you’ll want to cancel your Marketplace Pass subscription after upgrading as both subscriptions include the same Marketplace content. See [Canceling a Minecraft Marketplace Pass Subscription](../Marketplace-Pass-Subscriptions/Cancel-a-Minecraft-Marketplace-Pass-Subscription.md).

After you get your Realm started, be sure to bring your friends in! See [Invite Friends to Your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](./Invite-Friends-to-Your-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).
