If you own a Minecraft Realm, you can improve Realm performance and reduce lag by setting a Realms Hosting Region Preference. Options allow you to host your Realm near you and friends who play in your Realm.

## Access Advanced settings for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms

1.  Launch Minecraft and click the **Play** button.
2.  Select the **Realms** tab.
3.  Select your Realm and click the **Options** button.
4.  Select **Realm** **Settings** from the Options menu.
5.  Click the **Manage** **Realm** button.
6.  Click the **Advanced** button.

## Select a server region preference

If you do not set a preference, the Realm server location is automatically chosen based on the first player to join and local server capacity. The following options are available:

- **Automatic, first to join:** The first player to join will choose the server’s closest connection.
- **Automatic, Realm owner**: The Realm always connects to the owner’s closest location.
- **Specific Region**: The Realm will always connect to this same location selected.
