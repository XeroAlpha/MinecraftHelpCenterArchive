Are you unsure about whether you should report a player acting unruly in Minecraft? Below are some, but not all, reasons that might constitute us taking action against their account.

- Harassment or bullying
- Threat of physical harm to you or others
- Hate speech
- Offensive player name or gamertag
- Offensive custom player skin
- Inappropriate signs or constructions
- Commercial spamming

## What happens if I abuse the player reporting system?

You are responsible for the reports you submit. Knowingly sending incorrect reports to try to get another player banned, excessively sending irrelevant reports, or otherwise abusing the player reporting system can lead to repercussions for your account. Do not incite others into using the player reporting system for your sake.
