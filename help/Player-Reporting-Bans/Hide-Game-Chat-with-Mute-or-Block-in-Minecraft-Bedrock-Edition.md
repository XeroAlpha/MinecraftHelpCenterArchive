*For Minecraft: Java Edition, see* [*Hide Game Chat with Mute or Block in Minecraft: Java Edition*](./Hide-Game-Chat-with-Mute-or-Block-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md)*.*

If you don’t want to see a player’s in-game chat messages, you can go to their profile in Minecraft and select **Mute** or **Block**. To learn more about the differences between these, see [Differences Between Mute and Block](./Differences-Between-Mute-and-Block.md).

## Mute or block a player in-game

You can mute or block a player in-game through the player list.

1.  Pause the game.
2.  Select the player to mute or block from the player list on the right. This will open their profile.
3.  Select the button with three dots to open the Account options menu.
4.  Select **Mute** or **Block**.

## Mute or block a player through the friends list

You can also mute or block a player from the main menu.

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the Friends tab in the top-right.
4.  Select **Search for players**.
5.  Search for the player you want to mute or block by gamertag. If you don’t know their gamertag, select the **Recently Played With** tab.
6.  Select the player to view their profile.
7.  Select the button with three dots to open the Account options menu and select **Mute** or **Block**.

## Unmuting or unblocking a player

Unmuting or unblocking a player can be done by repeating the steps above for the muted or blocked player; selecting **Mute** or **Block** will unmute or unblock them.

Unmuting or unblocking a player takes effect immediately: you will be able to see an unmuted player’s chat messages and an unblocked player will also be able to see your profile and send you invites again.
