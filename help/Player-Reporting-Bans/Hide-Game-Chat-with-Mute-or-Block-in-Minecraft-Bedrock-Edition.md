*For Minecraft: Java Edition, see* [*Hide Game Chat with Mute or Block in Minecraft: Java Edition*](./Hide-Game-Chat-with-Mute-or-Block-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md)*.*

If you don’t want to see a player’s in-game chat messages, you can go to their profile in Minecraft and select **Mute** or **Block**. To learn more about the differences between these, see [Differences Between Mute and Block](./Differences-Between-Mute-and-Block.md).

## Mute or block a player in-game

1.  Pause the game.
2.  Select the **Social** button in the top-right.
3.  Find the player in **Players in Your World** or your **Friends List**.
4.  Open the three-dots overflow menu next to their name.
5.  Select **Mute** or **Block**.

## Mute or block a player through the friends list

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the **Social** tab in the top-right.
4.  Select **Search for players**.
5.  Search for the player you want to mute or block by gamertag. If you don’t know their gamertag, they may show up under the **Recently Played With** tab.
6.  Select the player to view their profile.
7.  Select the button with three dots to open the account options menu and select **Mute** or **Block**.

## Unmuting or unblocking a player

Unmuting or unblocking a player can be done by repeating the steps above for the muted or blocked player; selecting **Mute** or **Block** will unmute or unblock them.

Unmuting or unblocking a player takes effect immediately: you will be able to see an unmuted player’s chat messages and an unblocked player will also be able to see your profile and send you invites again.
