*For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, see* [*Hide Game Chat with Mute or Block in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition*](./Hide-Game-Chat-with-Mute-or-Block-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md)*.*

If you don’t want to see a player’s in-game chat messages, you can select **Mute** from the in-game social menu or **Block** them through the Xbox app. To learn more about the differences between these, see [Differences Between Mute and Block](./Differences-Between-Mute-and-Block.md).

## Mute a player in-game

You can mute a player in-game through the **Social Interactions** menu.

1.  Select the **P** key on your keyboard to bring up the in-game Social Interactions menu.
2.  Select the text bubble icon next to the player you want to mute.

## Mute or block a player through the Xbox app

You can also mute or block a player from the Xbox app. Instructions are available at [How to mute or block other players on Xbox](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/friends-social-activity/friends-groups/block-or-mute-other-player) on the Xbox support site. Locate the **On the Xbox app** header, expand it, and expand **Block another player**.

## Unmuting or unblocking a player

Unmuting or unblocking a player can be done by repeating the steps above for the muted or blocked player; selecting **Mute** or **Block** will unmute or unblock them.

Unmuting or unblocking a player takes effect immediately: you will be able to see an unmuted player’s chat messages and an unblocked player will also be able to see your profile and send you invites again.
