We believe each player can help us keep Minecraft a safe and welcoming place for everyone. To help with that, you may receive a reminder about our Community Standards while playing Minecraft when potentially inappropriate or harmful behavior is detected.

Our goal is to remind everyone of the expected conduct in our games and create an opportunity to reflect and change how they communicate with others before an account suspension or ban is required. If you received a reminder message in-game, be sure to review the [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards) to understand how we can keep Minecraft safe and fun for everyone.
