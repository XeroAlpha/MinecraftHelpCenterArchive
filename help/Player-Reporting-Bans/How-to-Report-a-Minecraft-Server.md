Players aren’t the only ones who deserve to be reported. Sometimes, servers can go against the [Minecraft End(er) User License Agreement](https://aka.ms/mc-eula). If you suspect that a server is doing something out of line, consider the following.

Familiarize yourself with our [Minecraft Usage Guidelines](https://aka.ms/MCUsageGuidelines). These guidelines explain how we allow commercial use of the Minecraft name, brand, and assets, including Minecraft servers. Here is a quick summary of some, but not all, behaviors that go against them:

- Gambling
- Pornography
- Pretending to be associated with Mojang or Microsoft
- Abusive behavior like attacking a group of people
- Redistributing Mojang games or game files
- Illegal activity

**Note:** If you are not certain if a server violates these guidelines, don’t send a report.

After carefully reviewing the resources above, you can visit the [Report a Server page](https://aka.ms/MCE-ReportServer) to let us know about a server’s activity. Please give as much information as possible so we can properly act upon their actions.

## Finding a Safe Server

Community servers each offer their own brand of fun and uniqueness. Find your favorite with the [Official Minecraft Server List](http://aka.ms/OfficialMinecraftServerList), where the servers follow our [community standards](https://aka.ms/MCUGCommunityStandards) and guidelines. In addition to community servers, you can also browse Partner Servers directly within Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
