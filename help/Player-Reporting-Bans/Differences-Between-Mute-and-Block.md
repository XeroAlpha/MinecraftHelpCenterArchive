Muting or blocking a player will hide their chat messages in game or in servers—and blocking a player will also prevent them from seeing your activity or accepting/sending your invites. Muting or blocking a player will not prevent them from interacting with you in-game; you will still be able to see and interact with each other’s characters in any shared worlds or Realms.

If you are a Realm owner and want to remove a problematic player, see [Moderate Your Minecraft Realm](../Manage-Realms-Settings/Moderate-Your-Minecraft-Realm.md).

Here’s more about the differences between muting and blocking.

## Mute

Muting is useful if you don’t want to see chat messages from a player, but you still want to be friends, or you want to only temporarily ignore a player’s messages.

- The muted player will not be alerted that you’ve muted them.
- You will see a “Muted” banner in the upper-right corner of a muted player’s profile picture.
- You will not see a muted player’s in-game chat messages, but they will still see yours.
- You will still see Minecraft Stories comments from muted players.
- Both of you will still be able to see each other’s Minecraft profiles.
- You can still be friends with a muted player.

## Block

Blocking a player will clearly end interaction between you and the blocked player.

- A blocked player will not see any of your online activity or chat messages in Minecraft.
- You won’t see any Xbox Live messages or game invites from a blocked player.
- A blocked player can’t join your Realm, even with an invite.
- Both of you will still see each other’s Minecraft Stories comments in a shared Realm.
- A blocked player will not be able to view your profile and may notice that you’ve blocked them.
- If you block a player you’re friends with, you’ll be immediately removed from their friends list. Your friends list may not reflect this until you close and reopen the game. You will have to re-add each other later if you want to be friends again.
- You will see a “Blocked” banner in the upper-right corner of a blocked player’s profile picture.
