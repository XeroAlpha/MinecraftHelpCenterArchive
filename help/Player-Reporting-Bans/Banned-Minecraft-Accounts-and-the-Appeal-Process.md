We combine the best available tools with a highly trained and dedicated team of moderators that work every day to celebrate and protect our players. Violations of our [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards) may result in a temporary or permanent ban of your account.

Violations that may result in bans include:

- Hate speech
- Sexual content and soliciting improper contact
- Real life threats
- Exposing the personal information of others
- Posting links to malicious software
- Impersonating staff
- Cheating/exploits (this includes anything that would negatively affect another person’s gameplay experience)
- General commercial spamming

## Results of a Banned Account

Banned players are not allowed to play on servers, join Realms, or host or join multiplayer games. Bans are connected to the unique ID for your Microsoft account and not your gamertag or profile name.

Permanent bans will be issued to players found in the most severe or repeated violations of the [community standards](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards).

If your account has been banned and you have a Realms Plus subscription, you should cancel your subscription so you will not be charged for content you cannot access.

See our [How do I Cancel my Minecraft Realms Plus Subscription](../Manage-Realms-Subscriptions/Renew-an-Expired-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-Subscription.md#h_01FGCVE88JFXE24WPYJJHZGQ9W) article for instructions to cancel.

## Appealing an Account Ban

Our goal is to ensure you know what type of action was taken and why, as well as any other relevant details. Being clear with you is an important part of our ongoing work to make Minecraft a safe and welcoming place for everyone.

- **Case Review:** If you have been banned or suspended from Minecraft, you can appeal the ruling by filling out the [Case Review form](https://aka.ms/Case-Review-Minecraft).
- **Updating Banned Content:** If you need to change an inappropriate name or skin, see [How to Update Banned Skins or Usernames in Minecraft](./Update-Banned-Skins-or-Usernames-in-Minecraft.md).

## Player Bans on Private Servers

Each server is self-moderated and at the discretion of the server owner. If you were banned or suspended from a privately-owned server on Minecraft please reach out to the Administrator of the server to appeal your ban. We do not intervene in private servers aside from overt violations of the Minecraft EULA and our Terms of Service.
