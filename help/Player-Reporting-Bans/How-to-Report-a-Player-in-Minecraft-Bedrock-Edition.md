The Minecraft: Bedrock Edition experience is meant to be safe and inclusive for all players. If a player makes you feel unsafe, insults you, or detracts from your experience in any way, you can report them using our in-game reporting tools. For more information about what may be considered inappropriate behavior, see [Guidelines for Reporting Inappropriate Player Behavior in Minecraft](./Guidelines-for-Reporting-Inappropriate-Player-Behavior-in-Minecraft.md).

## How to report a player in Bedrock

1.  Pause the game.
2.  Navigate to the player list on the right side and select the player you want to report.
3.  Select **Report**.
4.  Select where the incident took place via the drop-down menu.
5.  Click **Continue**.
6.  Select the reason you’re reporting the player via the drop-down menu.
7.  While optional, we ask that you also include text describing the situation. The more detailed the information, the better we can identify the problem and come up with a proper and fair solution.
8.  Click **Report** to finish reporting the player.

Additionally, you can also report players on the main menu:

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Go to the **Friends** tab.
4.  Select **Add Friend**.
5.  Search for the players gamertag if known. If not, open the **Recently Played With** tab.
6.  Select the player.
7.  Select **Report**.

**Note:** As an alternative, you can always report a player using our [Report a Concern form](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4416074743565).
