If you have used skins or a player name that does not comply with the [Minecraft Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards), that content in particular may be banned and removed from use by you and all other users. Here is how to make updates if content is banned and removed:

## Change your username for Minecraft

If your username or gamertag violates the community standards, see these resources to make an update:

- **Java Edition User Name:** Sign into your Microsoft account at the [Change Profile Name page on Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/mygames/editprofile). You can change your name once every 30 days, so choose your new name wisely.
- **Bedrock Edition Gamertag:** See [How to Change Your Gamertag](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360058974711).

## Change character skins in Minecraft

If your account was banned because of your character's appearance, see these articles to make a change:Â 

- **Java Edition Skin:** See [How to Make a Custom Skin in Minecraft: Java Edition](../Minecraft-Game-Guides/How-to-Make-a-Custom-Skin-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md).
