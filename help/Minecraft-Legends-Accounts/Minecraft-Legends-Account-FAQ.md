### PlayStation® 4 and 5

-   PlayStation® Store

### Nintendo Switch

-   Nintendo eShop

### Steam

-   The Steam store

## How can I change my Minecraft Legends in-game name?

The in-game name you see in Minecraft Legends will be the name associated with the following accounts. If you want to change that name, you must contact the appropriate support team:

### PCs and Steam

Uses a player's Xbox Live Gamertag as the player\'s in-game name. To find out how to change your Gamertag go to [Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028117/xbox-change-your-gamertag).

### Xbox One

Uses a player's Xbox Live Gamertag as the player\'s in-game name. To find out how to change your Gamertag go to [Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028117/xbox-change-your-gamertag).

### PlayStation® 

Uses a player's PlayStation® Network Online ID as the player\'s in-game name. To find out how to change your PSN ID go to the [PlayStation Network page](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/onlineid/change/).

### Nintendo Switch

Uses a player's Nintendo nickname before players link their Microsoft account. After players link their Microsoft account, the player\'s in-game name will be their chosen Xbox Live Gamertag. To find out how to change your Nintendo nickname, [visit this page](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15987/~/how-to-adjust-nintendo-account-profile-settings-%28country%2C-email%2C-etc.%29#DT:t1-q1a1EP:t1-q1a1-c).

To find out how to change your online Gamertag go to [Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028117/xbox-change-your-gamertag).

## Game Save Data

Generally, game save data does not sync between different platforms. Campaign save data will only sync between Minecraft Legends on Xbox consoles and the Windows version when purchased through the Microsoft Store (not Steam) when using the same Microsoft account.

See the [Minecraft Legends Marketplace FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/14790575702925) about Marketplace purchases across Microsoft accounts and platforms.

## Achievements in Minecraft Legends

Minecraft Legends features achievements on Xbox Consoles and through gameplay on the Xbox App, as well as Steam. PlayStation players can earn trophies for their efforts. The Nintendo Switch does not have achievements, however.

## Signing into a Microsoft Account for Online Multiplayer on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation®

To play online multiplayer and cross-platform play in Minecraft Legends on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation® consoles, you need to log in to the game using a Microsoft Account.

If you do not have a Microsoft Account, you can create one for free by following the directions in our article on [Setting Up a Microsoft Account](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077-How-to-Manage-Parental-Consent-Family-Settings-and-Realms-Multiplayer-Access-for-a-Child-Account#h_01FF8W4Y7MWC8RH3R5BHZE6YDA). 

**Note: A valid [Nintendo Switch Online](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service) membership is also required to play online on Nintendo Switch, or a [PlayStation®Plus](https://www.playstation.com/ps-plus) membership for PlayStation® consoles.**

## Set up an Xbox Live or Microsoft Account (includes multiplayer access for Child Accounts)

Minecraft Legends requires an Xbox Live or Microsoft account to play with friends even if you\'re not playing on Xbox or another Microsoft platform. Parents can set up and manage these accounts for their kids too.  

**Note: Child accounts are all accounts for those under the age of 16 for the US & EU, 19 for South Korea. If there isn\'t an adult account associated with the child account, the adult must make a Microsoft account and associate the already-created child account with it. Only parent accounts can modify settings. **

## What is a Microsoft account?   

It's an account that's used to verify your access to computers and Microsoft services and applications. If you use any of these services, you have a Microsoft account: 

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| -   Skype                         | -   MSN                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
