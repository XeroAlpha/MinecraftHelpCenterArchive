While Minecraft: Bedrock Edition will run smoothly with most Add-Ons, there can be compatibility issues running them simultaneously. If you’re experiencing performance issues or game crashes, you may want to disable resources packs and/or behavior packs. Instructions are separated by world type below.

*Before beginning, we recommend backing up your Minecraft world. See our [Backup & Restore](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125) section.*

## Singleplayer worlds

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play.**
3.  Select the **pencil icon** next to the world you want to change.
4.  Select the **Resource packs** or **Behavior packs** tab**.**
5.  Select the **Active** tab.
6.  Select the resource pack you want to deactivate and select **Remove.**

##  Realm worlds

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play.**
3.  Select the Realms tab.
4.  Select the Realm with the world you want to change and select **Settings**.
5.  Select the world slot you want to change and select **Edit World**.
6.  Select the **Resource packs** or **Behavior packs** tab.
7.  Select the **Active** tab.
8.  Select the resource pack you wish to deactivate and select **Deactivate**.

## Additional Add-On Troubleshooting Notes

- You must be the world owner to deactivate resource packs.
- You may also be unable to deactivate resource acks for world templates and adventures maps.
- Deactivating a world’s resource pack does not remove it from your storage. See [Delete Unused Marketplace Content in Minecraft](./Delete-Unused-Marketplace-Content-in-Minecraft.md).
- After an Add-On is removed, any Add-On mobs will also be removed. Add-On blocks will be replaced with updated blocks.
