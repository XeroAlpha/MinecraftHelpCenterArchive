Minecraft Add-Ons are identified by the hammer icon ![HammerIcon.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/24129485188877) when viewing featured content rows or searching the Marketplace or PlayStation Store in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. 

 

## Minecraft Add-Ons can introduce:

- **New content for your new or existing world**: This can include blocks, items, mobs, creatures, structures, furniture, or even rideable mounts.
- **New gameplay mechanics**: A quality-of-life Add-On can place a gravestone where the player dies, safely storing items until it is broken. A portals Add-On allows players to craft portals that the player can control to fast-travel between specified locations.

  
Add-Ons work on any platform that runs Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, but are not supported on personal, non-Realms servers.
