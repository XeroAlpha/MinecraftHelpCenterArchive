Minecraft Add-Ons refer to a category of [Minecraft Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace) content for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition that contains a resource pack and/or behavior pack.

- **A resource pack** is a collection of files that can add or change the textures, sounds, and other aspects of Minecraft assets.
- **A behavior pack** alters how the game behaves and can change the rules of the game, modify how entities function, or even introduce new game mechanics.

Here are some other common answers to Add-On questions:

- **What can Add-Ons do?** See [Find Minecraft Add-Ons: Customize with Add-Ons](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/add-ons) for examples of what resource and behavior packs can do—and see featured Add-Ons from Minecraft creators.
- **How do I get Add-Ons?** You can buy content from the [Minecraft DLC Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace) online or [Buy Content from the Minecraft Marketplace](../Buying-Marketplace-Content/Buy-Content-from-the-Minecraft-Marketplace.md) after you launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
- **Where can I use Add-Ons?** Add-ons work in single-player, multi-player, and Minecraft Realms worlds. They are not supported on personal, non-Realms servers.
- **Can I use multiple Add-Ons simultaneously?** Yes, but we recommend you play with a maximum of three. More Add-Ons can cause decreased performance or other issues.
- **Why wouldn’t I use mods instead?** Minecraft mods are exclusive to Minecraft: Java Edition. Add-Ons are for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and are easy to download, install, and play without further setup.
