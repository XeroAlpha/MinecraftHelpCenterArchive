After purchasing lots of content from the Minecraft Marketplace, you may notice that your menus are a little too filled up and it might slow down your game experience. In cases like this, we recommend deleting unused content to free up some storage space and let your device focus on the content you actually want to use.

**Note:** after you finish deleting the Marketplace content from your device, you will be able to download them again whenever you want, provided that they are either included in your Marketplace Pass subscription or you purchased the content.

## Deleting stored Marketplace content in Minecraft

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  SelectÂ **Settings**.
3.  Select **Storage**.
4.  Select either **Resource Packs** or **World Templates** to open those drop-down menus.
5.  Click the content you want to delete from storage. Click **Multiselect** to delete multiple items.
6.  Select the **trash can icon**.
7.  Select **Delete**.
