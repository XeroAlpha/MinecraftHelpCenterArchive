Creating a backup of a world is simple and easy. Creating backups is a good habit and can help you make sure you always keep your world safe. 

## How to find your Realms backups and restore them

In Minecraft: Java Edition, your world is backed up whenever you join the Realm and leave it. To find those backups, select your Realm and press **Configure**. At the bottom of the next screen will be **World Backups**.

On this page you can select any backup and press **Restore** or the **red arrow** to revert the world back to that version. Select **Download Latest** to take the most recent backup of your world and save it on a local drive and make it accessible in Single Player.

## Uploading a Backup World to your Realm

After purchasing a new Realm subscription and creating a new world within that Realm, you can access the Realm configuration menu to upload a backup. 

1.  From the main menu select** Realms **
2.  Find the Realm you wish to modify and select **Configure**
3.  Under **Worlds**, select an empty world slot 
4.  Click** Upload world **
5.  Select the backup you would like to load

If you encounter an error that prevents you from downloading your world, or if you are having difficulty uploading your world, please contact [Minecraft support ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new)for further assistance. 

## How does Mojang backup your Realm?

A Realm world is downloadable within 18 months of your subscription expiring, but the world backups associated with that Realm will be deleted 30 days after your subscription expires. In general, we save your progress every 30 minutes and at the end of your play session. This protects your primary save file from losing too much progress in the case of a crash and makes sure all of progress is saved properly at the end of your session.

Beyond auto-saving the main save file, we also take a backup every time we save. These backups are full copies of your primary save file from the point in time the backup was taken.

We can’t keep all of your backups around forever, though, so the following retention policy is in place:

- The four most recent backups are retained, regardless of age
- In the last 24 hours: We retain one backup per hour, up to a maximum of 4.
- 1 day to 8 days ago: We retain one backup per day.
- 9 days to 36 days ago: We retain one backup a week.
- 37 days to 121 days ago: We retain one backup a month.
- 122+ days ago: No backups are retained.

**Note: If you’d like to save a copy of your world indefinitely, we suggest you download your work to your local storage. Also, we keep the most recent backup within each given window above, meaning that as backups age they may move into the next window, which could result in an older backup being removed. **

## Can I export my Minecraft map from my Realm?

You can export your maps from any versions of Realms at any time within an 18-month period after your subscription has expired. Once your subscription has been inactive for more than 18 months, your world will be permanently deleted from Minecraft’s servers.       

## Can I upload my Minecraft map onto a Realm?

Yes, you can upload your own maps to a Realm. We currently support worlds up to 4GB in size, a substantial amount for map size.
