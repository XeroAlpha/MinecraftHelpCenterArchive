If you're playing on a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm and are looking to protect you or your child from harsh language, Minecraft: Java Edition now includes a profanity filter. Please note that managing these features through Minecraft.net is only available for Minecraft: Java Edition accounts.

Online safety features for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (consoles, mobile, PC) are managed through your Microsoft account/Xbox Live settings.

## To toggle the Minecraft: Java Edition Realm profanity filter, follow the steps below: 

1.  Log in with your Microsoft Account (MSA) on Minecraft.net.  
2.  Navigate to the 'My Account' tab on the side bar. 
3.  Under the 'Personal Info, Password, and More' tab, you'll find the 'Java Realms Profanity Filter' tab with its relevant toggle.
4.  The toggle is on by default, but you can click it to switch between on and off as you wish.

**Note that the profanity filter will only affect you and your Minecraft account. It will not affect the experience of other players within the Minecraft: Java Edition Realm.** 

## Minecraft: Java Edition Realm Profanity Filter FAQ 

### What does the Profanity Filter do? 

When toggled to 'On,' the Minecraft: Java Edition profanity filter will block bad language in chat, on signs, and in books. 

### Can a child MSA account turn off the profanity filter? 

A child MSA account cannot turn off the profanity filter. If a child MSA account navigates to the Java Realms profanity filter toggle, it will be greyed out.

### Can an adult MSA turn off the profanity filter for a child MSA? 

An adult MSA cannot turn off the profanity filter for a child MSA. 

### I'm logged in with an adult MSA account, but the profanity filter is greyed out 

If the Java Edition profanity filter is greyed out, but you're logged into an adult MSA, it's likely that your Minecraft: Java Edition entitlement isn't detected. You might not own Minecraft: Java Edition for this MSA. If you do own Minecraft: Java Edition on your adult MSA, but the toggle is still greyed out, contact [Minecraft Support](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?msclkid=877b56abd13b11ecafb9140f8b9d94b6).
