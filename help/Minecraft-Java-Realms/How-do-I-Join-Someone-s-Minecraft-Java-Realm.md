From the Minecraft Realms menu in Minecraft, you can view a list of Realms that are available to you. Each Realm that you join first requires an invitation, indicated by the flashing mail icon. After you accept it, that player's Realm will be available to you. Make sure that you have the latest public release of the game.

## How to Manually Update Minecraft 

To play the newest content in Minecraft: Java Edition realms, your game needs to be updated to the most recent version. This should happen automatically while your device is in standby mode or in use while connected to an active Internet connection. However, if you need to manually update your game, you’ll find the instructions for your Minecraft: Java Edition listed below.  

## How do I find my current version number? 

Find the version number on the bottom right of the Minecraft home screen. 

### Minecraft: Java Edition (PC/Mac) 

Open the Minecraft launcher. The launcher should automatically show you the latest release. If not:

- Click the arrow to the right of the Play button
- Select Latest Release. 
- Don’t see the launcher? [Download it](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download). 

A Realm's current status is indicated by the colored dot next to it: **green** means that the Realm is open and available to join, **yellow** shows that it expires soon, and **red** indicates that the Realm has expired or has been closed by the owner. 

If you're having trouble accepting invites or joining Realms, please make sure that you are not using a modded game client and are using a resource pack that contains textures for the Realm buttons. If this is the case, switch to the standard Minecraft game client, select **Options**, and then **Resource Packs**, and then return to the default. 

If you'd like to leave a Realm (leave the Realm's player list and delete it from your available Realms), from the Realms selection screen, highlight the Realm, and then select **Leave Realm**.
