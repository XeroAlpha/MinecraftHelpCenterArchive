## General Questions 

### What are Realms? 

Realms are personal multiplayer servers, run by Minecraft, just for you and your friends. Your Minecraft world is online and always accessible, even when you log off.  Only people you invite can join your world, and what you do there is up to you: create, survive, or compete!   

### Why are there two versions of Realms servers?   

We've developed two separate versions of Minecraft to optimize game performance on different platforms. Minecraft (the version you find on mobile, console and Windows 10 and above) runs on one kind of code, and Minecraft: Java Edition (for PC, Mac and Linux) runs on another. These two versions are incompatible with each other and are developed separately with different features. Players on Minecraft: Java Edition can't play on console, mobile or Windows 10 (and above) Realms and vice versa.   

### I’m playing on Windows 10 (or above). Which version do I need?  

You’ll need your subscription purchase to match the version of the game you are playing. For example, if you bought Minecraft from the Windows store, you'll need to buy Realms Plus for Minecraft. However, if you bought Minecraft: Java Edition through the Minecraft.net website then you'll need Realms for Minecraft: Java Edition.   

### Can I play on a Realm with other players on different devices? 

Yes. Most versions of Minecraft now allow players to get together, regardless of which device they're on. Anyone playing on, Android, Amazon Fire tablets, Gear VR, iPhone, iPad, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation<sup>®</sup>4, PlayStation<sup>®</sup>5, Windows 10 (and above), Windows Phone, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\|S. or can play together.  Players of Minecraft:  Java Edition can only play with each other.   

### Does Realms for Minecraft: Java Edition work with older versions of Minecraft or the newest Snapshots? 

You must run the most recent release of Minecraft to use Realms. Snapshot releases are not supported.   

### Does the owner of a Realm have any special privileges? 

Realm owners of any version get to choose who to invite and may switch between game modes. Realm owners on mobile, consoles, and Windows 10 (and above) can also: 

- Generate links to invite new members
- Download a backup of the Realm
- Promote other members to operators, enabling them to use slash commands in game  
- Choose to make a Realm uninitialized

## About Subscriptions 

### How much does a Realms: Java Edition subscription cost?  

You can [purchase a Realms: Java Edition subscription](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/realms-for-java) for a recurring monthly charge of \$7.99 USD per month. You may also purchase a 30-day Realm for \$9.99 USD or a 90-day Realm for \$26.99 USD; however, these are one-time charges and are not available as part of a recurring subscription.

**Note: A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms subscription is separate from a Minecraft: Java Edition Realms subscription.** **Realms subscriptions do not carry over between game versions. If you would like a Realm in Bedrock Edition and one in Java Edition, you need to set up two separate subscriptions. **

### How long will my subscription last?  

Subscriptions are available as a recurring monthly payment or in packages for six months. There is also a three-month option with the Minecraft: Java Edition. Some platforms do not currently allow recurring subscriptions, however.    

### Do I need Xbox Game Pass Core or another subscription to play on a Realm? 

Minecraft Java: Edition does not require an Xbox Game Pass Core subscription.

### How do I cancel my recurring subscription?   

Visit the **[Minecraft: Java Edition Realms Billing Issues FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4410000696077-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realms-Billing-Issues-FAQ#h_01FGCST20673JYZ76PB9BN4BNK)** for information on canceling recurring Minecraft Realms subscriptions. 

## Technical Questions

### Can I export my Minecraft Map from my Realm? 

You can export your maps from any versions of Realms at any time within an 18-month period after your subscription has expired. Once your subscription has been inactive for more than 18 months, your world will be permanently deleted from Minecraft’s servers.       

### Can I upload my Minecraft Map onto a Realm?  

Yes, you can upload your own maps to a Realm. We currently support worlds up to 4GB in size. That’s a substantial amount of allotted space. In order to use a world template from the Minecraft Marketplace on mobile devices, Windows 10 (and above) or console, you should create a new world using the template, then upload the world to your Realm.   

### Do Realms servers support modding? 

The Realms: Java Edition has support for a growing number of minigames and custom maps made by the community. Realms servers on mobile, console, and Windows 10 (and above) support Add-Ons and Marketplace maps, textures, and skins, however, full modding support is not available.   

### Can I use admin commands? 

Yes. Owners of Realms on any platform have access to most commands. On Minecraft for mobile devices, Windows 10 and above, or console, Realm owners can also promote members to be operators, which allows them to use slash commands in-game as well but does not grant them any other admin rights.  

## How to Create Your Realm

Only the owner of a realm must pay for a subscription. The owner can invite any number of friends, but only 10 players plus the owner can play at the same time.

**Note: You must set up a new Java Edition Realm through the Minecraft Launcher. You cannot set up a new Java Edition Realm through [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us).**

You may initialize one Realm per subscription, but you can change the game modes and maps for that Realm. 

After you make a purchase, your Realms subscription starts. After your payment is complete, open Minecraft, select **Minecraft Realms**, and then choose the option to create and configure your Realm. You'll see an option to enter a world name or to start with a preexisting world or map. You can change any setup options. 

To continue with a standard survival world, you can double-click your Realm. Alternatively, you can select **Configure** to open an additional menu of options.  

To rename your Realm or to give it a description, select **Settings** and then enter the title you want.

Selecting **World Options** lets you further customize your world in the following ways: 

### PVP (on/off)

Turns player-versus-player combat on or off. When off, players will not be able to injure one another. 

### Difficulty (peaceful, easy, normal, hard)

Changes the difficulty of the server. Hardcore mode is not available in Minecraft Realms. 

### Spawn protection (Off, 1 to 16)

Spawn protection disallows standard players from placing or destroying blocks in a specified radius from the world's spawn area. 

### Force game mode (on/off)

When enabled, this option forces all players into the server's selected default game mode when they log into the server. It is disabled by default, which preserves the game mode that a player was in when they logged out. 

### Game mode (survival, creative, adventure)

Changes the default game mode for all players on the server. The server owner or operator can use commands to change individual players' game modes in-game.

### Spawn animals (on/off)

Enables or disables the spawning of the game's neutral animals. 

### Spawn monsters (on/off)

Enables or disables the spawning of the game's aggressive monsters. 

### Spawn NPCs (on/off)

Enables or disables the spawning of non-player characters (villagers), also known as NPCs. 

### Command blocks (on/off)

Enables or disables use of command blocks. You must be the owner or operator of the Realm, and in creative mode, to use a command block.

**Note: Render and simulation distance are locked and cannot be modified on a Realm. As such, these may be set to lower value.  
**

## Realms Admin Options

Realms owners have various admin options available for further customization. From the **Realms** menu, selecting **Configure** on your Realm will enable you to implement the following options: 

### Have Multiple Worlds 

In your Realm, you have three different world slots and an additional slot that you can use for minigames. You can have three different worlds loaded in your Realm (for such as two survival worlds and one creative world). Each slot has its own world settings. However, only one slot can be active at a time. 

### Adjust the Overall Settings for Your Realms Server: 

#### Turn the Server On or Off

Select the green slider next to the **on** setting or the gray slider next to the **off** setting to turn your Realm on or off. Turning the server off will back up your world, and then cause the server to go offline; this action will not affect world data or your subscription in any way. 

### Players:

#### Invite Player

Select the button to invite another player by entering their Minecraft username. The player will be added to your invited players list even if the invitation is not accepted. Invitations that are not accepted within seven days will expire and need to be sent again if you'd like to play with that person. 

#### Remove a Player

Select the red **X** to remove a player from your list of invited players. 

#### Making a Player an "Operator" (OP)

Select the grayed-out crown icon to promote a player to an operator. Operators can use slash commands, send private messages, and set the world spawn point. Operators can't invite or remove players, but you should still pick a player you trust to promote. Select the gold crown icon to make that player a normal user once again. 

**Note: Please be aware that Minecraft Support cannot assist with player behavior reports. If you need to report a player, please contact the Realm owner.**

#### Settings

Lets you set the name and description of your Realm. 

#### Subscription

Select **Subscription** to see your Minecraft Realms subscription status or to extend your subscription. 

### Adjust Settings for Individual Worlds: 

#### Options

For game options for the active world, see the [<u>How to Create Your Realm</u>](#howtocreateyour-realm) section of this article. 

#### Backups

Enables you to see and switch between your backups as well as download the currently loaded backup. To learn how to download a world from Realms see the [Download Your Realms World](#downloading-your-realms-world) section.

#### Reset

This option lets you generate a new world, load a premade world template, or upload your own world. Note that resetting your world with any of these options will delete your current world and all backups. 

## How does Mojang backup your Realm?

A Realm world is downloadable within 18 months, but the world backups associated with that Realm may have been removed depending on our retention policy. In general, we take a backup every 30 minutes while you are playing, and at the end of a play session. We can’t keep all of your backups around forever though. If a Realm world is used actively, the following retention policy is in effect:  

- In the last 24 hours: We retain all backups.
- 1 day to 8 days ago: We retain one backup per day.
- 9 days to 36 days ago: We retain one backup a week.
- 37 days to 121 days ago: We retain one backup a month.
- 122+ days ago: No backups are retained.*** ***

**Note: If you’d like to save a copy of your world indefinitely, we suggest you download your work to your local storage. Also, we keep the most recent backup within each given window above, meaning that as backups age they may move into the next window, which could result in an older backup being removed.**

## Downloading Your Realms World

Here's a quick guide to downloading a world from Realms on Minecraft: Java Edition. 

First, start the game and select **Minecraft Realms**. There you'll find a list of Realms that you own or have been invited to. You can only download a world from a Realm that you own, as follows: 

1.  Go to your Realms configuration by selecting the button with a tool symbol.
2.  From the Realms configuration screen, go to your **World backups**.
3.  Select the **Download Latest **button and follow the instructions on your screen. 

The world you download will be saved with your single-player worlds. You can access downloaded worlds in single-player mode and you can upload them to a different Realm.

If the world you want to upload was created in a version of Minecraft that is older than the current game version, it might not be compatible with Realms. To solve this problem, try starting the world in single-player mode, which should update it to the latest version if your device is compatible. 

Downloaded worlds are also available in your saves folder located with your Minecraft files.

#### Minecraft: Java Edition 

The file to run the launcher is wherever you saved it. This may or may not default to your desktop or **Downloads** folder.  

### Find additional launcher files 

1.  Launch Minecraft, then log in.
2.  Go to **Launch Options**, choose a launch configuration, and then click the green arrow next to **Game Directory**. 

**Tip:** **Latest Release** is the default launch configuration. 

#### Windows computers 

Press [Win](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key)+R \> type %appdata%\\minecraft \> press **Ok**. 

#### OS X 

Open Finder then paste: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft in the **Search** box. 

#### Linux 

~ is your home directory, usually /home/YOURNAME, so ~/.minecraft would be /home/YOURNAME/.minecraft/. 

## How to Load Content to Your Realm 

You can load content such as Minigames, Adventures, World templates, and Experiences. It’s also possible to upload your single player worlds. 

### Choosing a World Slot 

You can have up to three different worlds saved in slots to your Realm. Only one slot can be active at a time, but it is easy and quick to switch between them. This is useful when you want to switch between Minecraft Realms content. 

1.  Access your Realms configuration menu.
2.  Select the world slot you want to switch to and confirm. In the following image the switch is from World 1 to World 2.

### Minigame 

A Minecraft Minigame is free community-made content available to any Realm owner. Loading a Minigame temporarily replaces the content currently loaded on your Minigame slot. 

1.  Select **Minigame** to switch the loaded content on your current world slot to a Minigame. 
2.  Choose a Minigame in the list and load it by selecting the **Select**

### Adventures / World templates / Experiences 

By selecting the **Reset World** button, you can load content to your current world slot. Note that resetting a world slot deletes the current world unless you save a backup first. The following steps will show you different types of available content: 

1.  Select **Reset World**.
2.  Choose which content you want to load.
3.  Adventures, World templates, and Experiences will present you with a list of available worlds. Choose the world you want to load and click **Select**.

### Upload World 

You can upload any local (single player) world to one of the three first world slots by selecting the **Upload World** option. Please note that Realms works only with unmodded worlds using the latest release game version.
