2.  Select **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Highlight the Realm and select **Configure**.
4.  Select **Players**.
5.  Select **Invite Player**.
6.  Input the player's Profile Name.
7.  Select **Invite**.

To accept the invite, see [How Do I Join Someone's Minecraft: Java Edition Realm?](./How-do-I-Join-Someone-s-Minecraft-Java-Realm.md)
