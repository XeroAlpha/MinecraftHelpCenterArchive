# What is player abuse reporting? 

## Why has this feature been implemented? 

-   Ensuring the safety of Minecraft players is at the heart of why we are releasing Player Reporting in Java. Without human moderation, online communities can become unwelcoming, harmful, or in some cases, dangerous to the security of individual players. We need to provide safeguards that will help keep all our players safe and welcome in the online environments where they play Minecraft. Player Reporting will help to keep Minecraft communities free from hate speech, bullying, harassment, sexual solicitation, and personal threats. We believe that human moderation and community guidelines are critical to reducing harmful behavior and promoting healthy Minecraft online communities.

-   In an effort to be clearer and more transparent with you, we have updated the messages displayed when an account is suspended or banned. Our goal is to ensure you know what type of action was taken and why, as well as any other relevant details. Being clear with you is an important part of our ongoing work to make Minecraft a safe and welcoming place for everyone.

## How do I Report a Player?

-   We have described the Player Reporting process in Minecraft: Java Edition on this [How To Report A Player](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/13019118732429) page.

# What can I be banned for? 

## Can I get banned for cussing or swearing? 

-   No, we will not ban players just for swearing or profanity. The type of behavior that will get you banned is hate speech, bullying, harassment, sexual solicitation, or violent threats. Hate speech is content or conduct that insults, intimidates, or threatens an individual or group based on an individual's identity, such as sexual orientation, religion, race/ethnicity, gender, or disability. These behaviors will have the consequence of a temporary suspension or permanent ban depending on the severity and frequency.  

##  Can I get banned for what I say in singleplayer? 

-   No. Player chat reporting is only available in multiplayer sessions where players can send chat to each other.  

## Will you ban people for talking about suicide? 

-   No. We care deeply about our players and if we are informed about a threat of imminent harm, we attempt to provide players in crisis with support resources in times of need.  

## Why does Mojang need to be involved in third-party server player reporting? Why not just Realms? 

-   All Minecraft players should expect the Minecraft Community Guidelines to apply to their Minecraft experience. We strive to ensure that all online play is safe and inclusive, but not all servers provide players with a way to report or resolve violations of those guidelines. Player Reporting is an additional resource for players who experience abuse, which can happen on any multiplayer Minecraft session, including private servers.
-   Server owners are free to act if a player reports a concern through server-provided means, but the player report review process is complicated and time-consuming work.  Not all server owners have the resources to investigate reports, but we have a team of human moderators dedicated to reviewing all player-submitted issues.
-   We have worked closely with a group of community-run Java server operators to get their early feedback on this feature. Their testing has been invaluable in making sure player reporting will work for server owners.

# Banning/Suspending 

## If I don\'t find it offensive and my other friends don\'t find it offensive, why can I be banned for it?

-   Reports must be submitted by another player. If no one is offended and no one makes a report, then we will not receive a report that could be the basis for banning.

## Can I get banned for using a custom skin?

-   Skins will only be banned if our moderation team determines they are harmful in nature. Skins are an essential part of the Minecraft experience, and we encourage the artistic expression of our players, but we also work to ensure that all online play is safe and inclusive. Skins used to display objectionable content, propagate hate or other violations of our [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards#:~:text=Community%20Standards%20for%20Minecraft%201%20Minecraft%20is%20for,and%20inclusive%204%20Hate%20has%20no%20place%20here) may result in action.

## What does it mean if my account is "banned/suspended"? 

-   For the duration of your account ban, you will not be able to connect to multiplayer servers or Realms on past, current, and future versions of Minecraft. 
-   You will still be able to play in singleplayer.

## Will I know why my account has been banned? 

-   Yes. The reason and duration of a ban will be displayed on the ban screen when launching the game. 
-   For older versions, the ban reason will be stated when attempting to join a multiplayer session. 

## What does it mean if my skin is banned?

-   If your skin is banned, you will be notified when launching the game.
-   You will still be able to play multiplayer and singleplayer, but your skin will be replaced with a default one in all contexts.
-   You can change your skin at any time at [this link](https://www.minecraft.net/msaprofile/mygames/editprofile).
-   This banned skin cannot be selected by any player after being banned.

## I only play singleplayer, why do I have a default skin?

-   When a skin is banned, it is removed from every player with that skin.
-   Another player with your skin might have been reported by a player on another server and found to be in violation of our [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards).

## What does it mean if my name is banned?

-   If your name is banned, you will be notified when launching the game.
-   You will not be able to play online but can still play singleplayer.
-   You can change your name at any time at [this link](https://www.minecraft.net/msaprofile/mygames/editprofile).
    -   You can usually only change your name at most once every 30 days, but this limit does not apply if your name has been banned.
-   This banned name cannot be selected by any player after being banned.

## Can I appeal? 

-   Yes, you can submit an appeal at [this form](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360003469452) to have your case re-reviewed by a human investigator.  

## Are all bans permanent? 

-   Ban durations vary between temporary and permanent, depending on the severity of the case. 
-   Most bans are temporary and there are different durations of bans based on the severity and frequency of the abuse. 
-   Permanent bans are reserved for the most severe or recurring abuse. 

## Why is this an account ban and not an individual server ban? 

-   There are serious forms of abuse that require broad action, part of which includes preventing the abuser from continuing their abuse in other spaces. 

## Will I get banned without my case being reviewed by a human?  

-   No. Our team of human moderators handle player reports. This team is dedicated to Minecraft, and familiar with the community, platform, and lore. Our team reviews every report before any action is taken.

# False Bans & Abuse of the Feature 

## Are you spying on my Personal or Third-Party server? 

-   This system does not monitor chat -- no chat messages are sent to us until a player decides to send a report. 

## Is this a player-censoring chat filter? 

-   No. The player reporting system does not censor or prevent any chat messages from being sent. 

## Can someone create a chat report without evidence? 

-   Reporters must select offending chat messages as well as a report category to create a chat report.  

## Can my messages be taken out of context in a chat report? 

-   When a chat report is sent, surrounding chat lines are sent along with the reported messages to give our investigators more context of what was going on in the game.  

## What about the context of in-game actions beyond chat? 

-   Our investigators are trained specifically for Minecraft and are aware that the chat is made in the context of a game that involves combat-related chat. 

## What technical measures are there to prevent messages being forged? 

-   1.19 introduced cryptographically signed chat, which prevents the forging and/or rearranging of player messages. Any message that has been forged will be flagged for our investigators. Abuse of the reporting system with fake reports or reports using forged evidence can result in action taken against the reporter. 

## How will context be considered in a skin or name report?

-   Depending on the context of the report and history of the reported player, moderators may choose to:
    -   Suspended their account from online play.
    -   Ban the skin or name globally.
-   If you believe your account, name, or skin has been incorrectly banned, you can always [submit an appeal](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360003469452).

## Can\'t malicious players just change their skin?

-   Repeated violations of our community guidelines may result in account action in the form of player account suspension or ban. 

## Is the creator of a skin responsible if the skin has been banned?

-   No. Players are responsible for the skins they choose.
-   If a skin is banned by a moderator, no player will be able to use that skin.

## What if a custom server replaces or disguises my skin?

-   Only the skin you have set in your account settings in the Launcher or on minecraft.net will be associated with your account.
-   When a skin is reported, the specific skin seen by the reporting player is provided as evidence.
-   If the skin is violating our [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards), the skin may still be removed, but this will not result in suspension from online play.

## Will I be automatically banned if I am reported by a lot of players? What about creators or famous individuals getting targeted? 

-   The volume of reports does not correspond to an automated action being taken on a report. The reported evidence is always the basis of any action. The volume of reports does not constitute more evidence.
-   Players are responsible for the reports that they create, and abuse of the player reporting system can lead to temporary or permanent bans, depending on the severity and frequency of the abuse.

## What if someone creates a mod that spams/fakes reports? 

-   Abuse of the report system with multiple/fake reports will result in action taken against the reporter including temporary or permanent bans, depending on the severity and frequency of the abuse.
-   Reports cannot be anonymous, and they must contain valid evidence of an abusive chat message, skin, or name from within the game, and a category for that abuse.
-   Players are responsible for the reports that they create, and abuse of the player reporting system can lead to temporary or permanent bans, depending on the severity and frequency of the abuse.

## But what if somebody gains access to my account? 

-   Unfortunately, if an attacker has gained access to your account, we would not be able to distinguish between you and them. That's why it's important to enable 2FA, use a strong password for your account, and don't install untrusted mods or programs.
