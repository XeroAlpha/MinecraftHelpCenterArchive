World seeds are a string of numbers that Minecraft uses to recreate particular builds of a world when it generates. After you copy a world seed, you can share it with friends and use it to create new Worlds from the same base map. You can paste it into the world seed section of the **World** settings when creating a new world.

3.  Select the world with the seed you want to copy and select **Play Selected World**.
4.  Press the **T key** to open the chat.
5.  Type **/seed** into chat and press **Enter** to display the world seed.
