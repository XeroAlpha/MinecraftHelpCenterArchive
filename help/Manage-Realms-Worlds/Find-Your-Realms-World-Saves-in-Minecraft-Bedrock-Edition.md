Backup save files of your Realms world are stored in Realm storage, which keeps both automatic and manual saves. Realm storage helps you manage your worlds without losing progress.

## Access Realm Storage

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select the **Play** button.
3.  Select the **Realms** tab and select your Realm.
4.  Select **Settings**.
5.   Select **Manage Realm**.
6.  Select **Saves**.

You have the option to view and manage both Manual and Automatic saves in this menu. Realm storage provides a limited amount of space for your saves. If you need to free up space, you can back up your world to local storage before deleting data from Realm storage. For instructions, see [Download a Realms World in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./Download-a-Realms-World-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md).

Note that resource packs do not increase the space your world occupies in Realm storage. When you download a saved world, both the world and its associated packs are included.
