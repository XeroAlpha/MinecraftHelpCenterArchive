1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Play**.
2.  Select the **Realms** tab.
3.  Select the Realm with the world you want to download and select **Settings**.
4.  Select the world you want to download and select **Edit world**.
5.  Select the **Backups** tab.
6.  Select the **download icon** next to the version of the world you want to download.

The world will be downloaded and added to your Worlds tab and can also be copied from your file storage.
