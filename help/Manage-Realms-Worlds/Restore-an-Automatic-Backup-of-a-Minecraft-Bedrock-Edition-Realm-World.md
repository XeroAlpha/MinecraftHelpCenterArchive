Restoring a world from an automatic backup on your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm can undo unwanted changes or fix corrupted files. Restoring a world reverts all progress to what was captured in the save, including builds and items.

Here’s how to find Minecraft’s automatic backups and restore them on your Realm.

## How to restore your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Play**.
2.  Select the **Realms** tab on the Play screen.
3.  Select the Realm with the world you want to restore and select **Settings**.
4.  Select the slot with world you want to restore and select **Edit World**.
5.  Select the **Backups** tab, then select one of the available backups.
6.  Select **Replace Realm with Backup** to restore your world progress with the automatic backup.

To restore a manual backup, see [Upload a World to a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](./Upload-a-World-to-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).
