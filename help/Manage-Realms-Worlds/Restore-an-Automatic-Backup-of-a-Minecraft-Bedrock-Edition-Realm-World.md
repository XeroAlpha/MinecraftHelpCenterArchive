Restoring a cloud save of your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm world from an automatic or manual backup can undo unwanted changes or fix corrupted files. Restoring a world reverts all progress to what was captured in the save, including builds and items.

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Play**.
2.  Select the **Realms** tab on the Play screen.
3.  Select the Realm with the world you want to restore and select **Settings**.
4.  Select **Manage Realm**.
5.  Select **Saves**, then select the Manual or Automatic tab depending on where your backup is saved.
6.  Select the **kebob menu button **(three dots) to the right of the save file you wish to restore.
7.  Select **Restore save** from the Options menu.
