A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm invite link allows anyone with the link to join your Realm. This can be useful if you’re inviting multiple friends to your Realm via email or messaging. Here’s how to create and manage an invite link to your Realm.

## Create a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition invite link

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Play**.
2.  Select the **Realms** tab on the Play menu.
3.  Select the Realm you want to send invites to, then select **Settings**.
4.  Select **Manage Realm**.
5.  Select **Invite Links** from the Manage Realm menu.
6.  Select **Add new invite link**.
7.  Adjust settings, then copy and share the link. 

When you share the link, anyone who opens it will see your Realm name in a browser with an option to join.

## Manage Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm links

After you create a link, you can modify it in the following ways:

- **Disable the link**: Toggle Activate link off to temporarily close it to new players. It will be on by default.
- **Invalidate the link**: Select Remove link to prevent new players from joining with the current link.
- **Set an expiration date**: Go to the Advanced Settings tab to set an expiration date before sharing the link.
