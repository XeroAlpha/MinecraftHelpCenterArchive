*For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, see* [*Upload a World to a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm*](./Upload-a-World-to-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md)

If you don’t want to start a new world on your Minecraft Realm, here’s how to upload a single-player or saved Realm world. 

## How to upload a world to a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Minecraft Realms**.
2.  Select the Realm you want to change, then select **Configure**.
3.  Add a world to an empty slot or replace an existing world:
    - **Select a world to replace:** You can identify the active world by the green checkmark in the top-right corner of its portrait.
    - **Add world to an empty slot:** Select an empty world slot, then select **Continue**, if the active world is not the one you want to replace.
4.  Select **Reset World**, then **Upload World**.
5.  Select the world you want to upload onto the Realm, then **Upload**.
6.  Select **Done** after the upload is complete.

To move external files for upload, see [Sideloading Worlds into Minecraft: Java Edition](../Backup-Restore/Sideloading-Worlds-into-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md). The maximum world size is 4GB.
