*For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, see* [*Upload a World to a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm*](../Manage-Realms-Settings-Worlds/Upload-a-World-to-a-Minecraft-Realm.md)

If you don’t want to start a new world on your Minecraft Realm, here’s how to upload one you already created.

## How to upload a world to a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm

1.  Launch Minecraft and select **Minecraft Realms**.
2.  Select the Realm you want to change, then select **Configure**.
3.  Add a world to an empty slot or replace an existing world:
    - **Select a world to replace:** You can identify the active world by the green checkmark in the top-right corner of its portrait.
    - **Add world to an empty slot:** Select an empty world slot, then select **Continue**, if the active world is not the one you want to replace.
4.  Select **Reset World**, then **Upload World**.
5.  Select the world you want to upload onto the Realm, then **Upload**.
6.  Select **Done** after the upload is complete.

There is a 4GB maximum world size for uploads. To transfer your world from a different device, see [Locating Minecraft: Java Edition Files for Backup or Transfer](../Backup-Restore/Locating-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Files-for-Backup-or-Transfer.md).
