Minecraft Realms automatically creates a backup save of your world at regular intervals. This allows you to restore your world if something goes wrong.  

We automatically save your progress:

- Every 30 minutes
- When you select Save & Quit in the menu screen  
- Any time you disconnect from your Realm.

We can’t keep all of your saves around forever, so the following retention policy is in place:

- The four most recent saves are retained.
- In the last 24 hours: We retain one save every 4 hours.
- 1 day to 8 days ago: We retain one save per day.
- 9 days to 36 days ago: We retain one save per week.
- 37 days to 121 days ago: We retain one save per month.
- 122+ days ago: No saves are retained.

A Realm world is downloadable within 18 months of your subscription expiring, but the world backups associated with that Realm will be deleted 30 days after your subscription expires.

## Keep Your Own Backup

If you’d like to save a copy of your world indefinitely, we suggest you download your work to your local storage. To learn how to make your own backup or manage your manual or automated backups, see the articles below:
