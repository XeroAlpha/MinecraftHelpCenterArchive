Minecraft Java: Edition Realm worlds can be restored from an automatic backup to undo unwanted changes or fix corrupted files. Restoring a world reverts all progress to what was captured in the save, including builds and items.

## Restore a Realm world

1.  Launch Minecraft: Java Edition.
2.  Select **Minecraft Realms**.
3.  Select your Realm and select **Configure**.
4.  Select **World Backups** from the Worlds tab.
5.  Select **Restore** next to the version you want to load.
