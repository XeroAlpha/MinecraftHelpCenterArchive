Creating a backup of a world is simple and easy. Creating backups is a good habit and can help you make sure you always keep your world safe. 

To learn how we choose what versions of your Realm to backup, see [How Mojang Saves Backups for Your Minecraft Realm](./How-Mojang-Saves-Backups-for-Your-Minecraft-Realm.md).

## How to find your Realms backups and restore them

In Minecraft: Java Edition, your world is backed up whenever you join the Realm and leave it. To find those backups, select your Realm and press **Configure**. At the bottom of the next screen will be **World Backups**.

On this page you can select any backup and press **Restore** or the **red arrow** to revert the world back to that version. Select **Download Latest** to take the most recent backup of your world and save it on a local drive and make it accessible in Single Player.

## Uploading a Backup World to your Realm

After purchasing a new Realm subscription and creating a new world within that Realm, you can access the Realm configuration menu to upload a backup.  Any world that is up to 4 GB in size can be uploaded.

1.  From the main menu select** Realms **
2.  Find the Realm you wish to modify and select **Configure**
3.  Under **Worlds**, select an empty world slot 
4.  Click** Upload world **
5.  Select the backup you would like to load 

If you encounter an error that prevents you from downloading your world, or if you are having difficulty uploading your world, please contact [Minecraft support ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new)for further assistance.
