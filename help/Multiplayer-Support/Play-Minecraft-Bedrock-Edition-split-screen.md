Minecraft: Bedrock Edition allows players in the same location to share one console and play in split-screen mode. The number of supported players depends on the console:

- **Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S**: four players.
- **Sony PlayStation 4/5**: four players.
- **Nintendo Switch**: four players, two players recommended.

## How to Play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in split-screen mode

1.  Launch Minecraft and join your world as player one.
2.  Power on and connect the controller for player two.
3.  Select the console user profile for player two.
4.  Press the button as directed by the on-screen prompt to add another player.
5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 for additional players if needed.

Some consoles may require separate console accounts or an active online subscription, depending on your settings. See [Requirements to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Split-Screen](./Requirements-to-Play-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Split-Screen.md) for more information.
