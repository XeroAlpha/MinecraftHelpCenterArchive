Dedicated servers are hosted by individuals and are not partnered with Minecraft. By contrast, Partner Servers specifically work with Minecraft. Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition versions both have dedicated servers, but only Minecraft: Bedrock Edition has Partner servers. If you are looking to set up a server for your friends and community, you can explore the links below.

**How to download the software required to set up your dedicated Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server**

1.  Visit the [Download Server Software for Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock) page.
2.  Locate the live or preview version you want for either Windows or Linux.
    - **Note:** This software is not available for Mac.
3.  Check the **Minecraft End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy** box.
4.  Click **Download**.

Your download will include a “How to use the dedicated server” guide that will help you through the installation steps to get you up and running.
