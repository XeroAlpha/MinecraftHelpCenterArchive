If you'd like to play Minecraft: Java Edition with other people, this article can help with troubleshooting steps if you have difficulty connecting.

## Resolve Minecraft: Java Edition multiplayer connection issues

- **Restart Minecraft**: Close Minecraft: Java Edition and reopen it.
- **Restart Your Device**: Restarting can often clear errors in connections.
- **Sign Out and Back In**: [Sign out of your Microsoft account](../Account-Sign-In/Sign-Out-of-Minecraft.md), close the game, and then log in again.
- **Check Your Connection**: If you are using a wireless connection, ensure that you have a stable connection to your router. You may need to reset or restart your router. You can also conduct a speed test to verify your internet connection or move closer to your router.
- **Verify Network Bandwidth**: Check your currently running programs for anything that is using your Internet bandwidth and close those programs.
- **Check Your Firewall**: If you have a firewall, antivirus software, or are using a VPN, check the settings to be sure that it is not blocking or slowing your connection. Ports that need to be open are 80 without destructive proxies, 443 without destructive proxies, 3748, 19132, 19133.
- **Check Your Router Settings**: Configure your router to use moderate or open Network Address Translation (NAT).
- **Change to Ethernet Connection**: If you’re on a stationary device, try connecting using an Ethernet cable instead of using Wi-Fi.
- **Revert to a Previous Save**: Try reverting to a previous save of your world.
- **Change World Slots**: When troubleshooting Realms issues, move the world you're having trouble with to a different world slot. See [How to Upload Worlds onto a Minecraft Realm](../Manage-Realms-Settings-Worlds/Upload-Worlds-onto-a-Minecraft-Realm.md).
