Dedicated servers are hosted by individuals and are not partnered with Minecraft. By contrast, Partner Servers specifically work with Minecraft. Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition versions both have dedicated servers, but only Minecraft: Bedrock Edition has Partner servers. If you are looking to set up a server for your friends and community, you can explore the links below.

## Download software for a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server

1.  Visit the [Download Server Software for Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock) page.

    - **Note:** This software is not available for Mac.
3.  Check the **Minecraft End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy** box.
