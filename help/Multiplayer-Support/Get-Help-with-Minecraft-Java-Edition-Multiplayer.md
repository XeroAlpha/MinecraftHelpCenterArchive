If you'd like to play Minecraft: Java Edition with other people, this article can help with troubleshooting steps if you have difficulty connecting.

## Steps to resolve connection issues

- Close Minecraft: Java Edition and reopen it.
- Restart your computer or device and see if this fixes the issue. Restarting can often clear errors in connections.
- Log out of your Microsoft account, close the game, and then log in again.
- If you are using a wireless connection, ensure that you have a stable connection to your router. You may need to reset or restart your router.
- Check your currently running programs for anything that is using your Internet bandwidth and close those programs.
- If you have a firewall, antivirus software, or are using a VPN, check the settings to be sure that it is not blocking or slowing your connection.
- Configure your router to use moderate or open Network Address Translation (NAT).
- If youâ€™re on a stationary device, try connecting using an Ethernet cable instead of using Wi-Fi.
- Try reverting to a previous save of your world.
- Switch the world slot and open a new world.
