Minecraft is best played with friends, so let’s get you on your way to adding your friends to your world.

## Step 1: Link or sign in with your Microsoft account

Signing in with a Microsoft account on your gaming platform enables cross-platform play and allows all players to connect through their Friends list. Players not using a Microsoft account may not be able to connect to some multiplayer games. See these articles for information:

- [How to Link Microsoft and PlayStation Accounts in Minecraft ](../Linking-Microsoft-Accounts/How-to-Link-Microsoft-and-PlayStation-Accounts-in-Minecraft.md)
- [How to Link Your Microsoft Account to Minecraft on Nintendo Switch](../Linking-Microsoft-Accounts/How-to-Link-Your-Microsoft-Account-to-Minecraft-on-Nintendo-Switch.md)
- [How to Sign in to Minecraft with a Microsoft Account on Mobile](../Linking-Microsoft-Accounts/How-to-Link-a-Microsoft-Account-to-Minecraft-on-Mobile.md)

**Note:** If you are playing Minecraft on Xbox or a personal computer, you are already playing with a Microsoft account, so no need to worry about linking!

## Step 2: Add players to your friend list

Add all the other players to your Friends list from the Play screen in Minecraft to make sure all players are connected and can find your game. See [How to Add Friends to your Friend List in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./How-to-Add-Friends-to-Your-Friend-List-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md).

## Step 3: Invite them to your world

Now that you’re on each other’s friend list, follow these steps to invite other players to your world.

- Launch Minecraft and select **Play**.
- Click on the **Worlds** tab and click the **pencil** icon next to the world you want to play.
- Select **Multiplayer** from the menu and make sure **Multiplayer game** is on and adjust other access settings as needed.
- Return to the **Worlds** tab and click on your world to start the game.
- Pause the game to bring up the menu.
- Select **Invite to Game**.
- Click the gamertags that you want to invite in your friend list.
- Select **Send X Invites**.
- Wait for your friends to join in and have some fun!
