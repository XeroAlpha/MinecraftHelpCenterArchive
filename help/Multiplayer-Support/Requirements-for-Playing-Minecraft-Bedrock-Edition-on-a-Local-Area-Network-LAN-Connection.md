When trying to [play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition local multiplayer](./Play-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Local-Multiplayer.md), you may be unable to join or see the host’s world. If you’re having problems, check these requirements:

- **"Hide LAN worlds" disabled:** The “Hide LAN worlds” button in the upper-left of the Worlds window should be toggled off.
- **Microsoft account sign-in:** Players on consoles and mobile devices need to sign in with a Microsoft account.
- **Multiplayer subscription active**:  Console players need an active [Xbox Game Pass Core](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass), [Nintendo Switch Online](https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/), or [PlayStation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/) subscription.
- **World player limits apply**: Up to eight players can play on Windows PCs and consoles, and up to five can play on mobile platforms. For up to 10 players, consider a [Realms Plus subscription](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/bedrock).
- **Cross-play functionality:** Nintendo Switch players can only play with other Nintendo Switch players via Bluetooth over a local area network. See [Join a Friend’s Online World in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./Join-a-Friend-s-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-World-Online.md) or [Play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition split-screen](./Play-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-split-screen.md) for other cross-platform options.

If you’re still unable to join or see a LAN game, try [Troubleshooting Unable to Join Multiplayer Worlds in Minecraft](./Troubleshoot-Unable-to-Join-Multiplayer-Games-in-Minecraft.md).
