You can play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with friends online by joining their world, joining a Realm, or playing together on a server. In this article, we’ll focus on how to join a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server.

To learn about other ways to play with friends, see:

- [Join a Friend’s Online World in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./Join-a-Friend-s-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-World-Online.md)
- [Join a Friend's Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](../Create-or-Join-Realms/Join-a-Friend-s-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md)
- [Play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition local multiplayer](./Play-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Local-Multiplayer.md)

## Join a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition online server

1.  Launch Minecraft
2.  Select **Play** from the Minecraft title screen.
3.  Select the **Servers **tab.
4.  Select the server you would like to join. Details about the server will be shown in the window on the right, and you can read through a server’s description before joining.
5.  Select **Play**.

For additional Minecraft servers that are safe to join and fun for all ages, see [the Official Minecraft Server List](https://findmcserver.com/).

## Add a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server to your list

If the server you want to join is not in the partner/server list, you can add it manually if the server owner has provided you with the IP address. 

1.  Launch Minecraft
2.  Select **Play** from the Minecraft title screen.
3.  Select the **Servers **tab.
4.  Select **Add Server**.
5.  Enter a Server name and the Server address. The Server address will be either an IP address (1.0.0.1) or a URL (www.example.com).
6.  Enter the server’s port, if required. The default port for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is 19132.
7.  Select **Add and play** if you’d like to play immediately or **Add server** if you want to play later.
