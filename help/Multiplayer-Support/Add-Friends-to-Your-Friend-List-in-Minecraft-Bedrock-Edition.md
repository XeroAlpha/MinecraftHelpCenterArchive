If you and your friend play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on different platforms, you will need to add each other to your Microsoft account friend lists first. This is done through the game, and you can share your Microsoft account Gamertag from the same screen.

## Add friends to your friends list

1.  Join your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition single-player or Realm world.
2.  Pause the game.
3.  Select the **Social** button in the top-right.
4.  Select **Search** **for** **players**.
5.  Enter your friend’s Microsoft account gamertag into the **Find Players by gamertag** field.
6.  Select the **Add** button next to your friend’s gamertag.

## Add recommended friends from the search for players menu

Minecraft will display gamertags based on your existing friends list and people you follow.

To add a new friend from the Social list, select their gamertag under **Recommended friends** and then select **Add friend.**

## Find and share your Microsoft account gamertag

You can share your gamertag with friends from the Social list, too.

- **Scan QR Code**: Have your friend use their mobile device to scan your QR code. This will navigate them to your Xbox profile where they can add you as a friend.
- **Share**: The Share button will open a context menu for sending your gamertag.
- **Copy** **Gamertag**: Select Copy Gamertag to copy your gamertag to the clipboard for you to share with friends however you’d like.
