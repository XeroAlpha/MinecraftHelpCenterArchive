If you and your friend are planning to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on different platforms, you will need to add each other to your Microsoft account friend lists first. This is done through the game, and you can share your Microsoft account Gamertag from the same screen.

## Add friends in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

1.  Start Minecraft. 
2.  Select **Friends** from the launch screen.
3.  Select **Search for players.**
4.  Enter your friend’s Microsoft account gamertag into the **Search gamertag** field.
5.  Select the **Add** button next to the gamertag you want to add.

If you want to view the full profile before adding a friend, click on the gamertag in "Recommended friends" and then select the **Add** **friend** button from the Profile screen.

## Share your Microsoft account gamertag

If you’d like to share your gamertag with friends, the options below are available from the same **Friends** \> **Add Friend** section referenced above.

1.  - **Scan QR Code**: Have your friend use their mobile device to scan your QR code. This will navigate them to your Xbox profile where they can add you as a friend.
    - **Share**: The Share button will open a context menu for sending your gamertag.
    - **Copy** **Gamertag**: Select Copy Gamertag to copy your gamertag to the clipboard for you to share with friends however you’d like.
