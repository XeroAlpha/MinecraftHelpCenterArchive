Want to join a friend’s world in Minecraft and go on a great adventure together? Here are tips to help you join a friend’s online world.

## Check game settings before joining an online world

Minecraft uses Microsoft and Xbox services to allow you to connect with other players. Most settings are enabled by default, but it’s a good idea to verify your settings so you don’t miss any of the fun. Here’s what you need to check:

- **Microsoft account sign in**: If you’re playing on a console or mobile device, you may need to link your Microsoft account or sign in with a Microsoft account to make sure you are connected to the services that allow you play with players on other platforms and to join online games. See [Linking Microsoft Accounts](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/29296773863181) for information.
- **Account permissions**: If you are playing with a child account, have the family organizer check to make sure you have permissions to join multiplayer games. See [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md) for information.
- **Friends lists**: Yes, you need to declare your friendship by official adding each other to your Friends list within Minecraft. See [How to Add Friends to Your Friend List in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./How-to-Add-Friends-to-Your-Friend-List-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) for information.
- **Game version**: You may encounter problems connecting to multiplayer games if all players aren’t playing the most recent version of Minecraft. Check the settings on your game platform to make sure you’re receiving automatic updates. If you use the Launcher, select “Latest release” when you start the game. See our [Download & Install](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166490706957) help section for information about manually updating Minecraft.
- **Online subscriptions**: if you are playing Minecraft multiplayer on a console, you must be subscribed to either [Xbox Game Pass Core](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass), [Nintendo Switch Online](https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/), or [PlayStation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/) to be able to play with friends.

## Join a friend’s online world

After you’ve checked everything to make sure you are set up to connect with your friends, you’re ready to join online games. Your friend needs to start the game and be online for you to see the game in Minecraft. Refer your friend to How to Invite Friends to Your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition World and [Troubleshooting Unable to Join Multiplayer Worlds in Minecraft](../Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Realms/Troubleshooting-Unable-to-Join-Multiplayer-Worlds-in-Minecraft.md) if things don’t go as expected.

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Click the **Friends** tab. Only Friends who are online will appear.
4.  Click on your friend’s gamertag under **Joinable Friends** to enter their world.
