You can play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with friends online by joining their world, joining a Realm, or playing together on a server. In this article, we’ll focus on joining a friend’s world directly via an internet connection.

To learn about other ways to play with friends, see:

- - [Play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition online in a multiplayer server](./Play-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Online-in-a-Multiplayer-Server.md)
  - [Join a Friend's Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](../Create-or-Join-Realms/Join-a-Friend-s-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md)
  - [Play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition local multiplayer](./Play-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Local-Multiplayer.md)

You can join a friend’s Minecraft: Bedrock Edition world if you’re both friends in Minecraft and online at the same time.

## Join a friend’s world online

1.  Have your friend start a game online so you can see the game in Minecraft.
2.  Launch Minecraft.
3.  Select **Play**.
4.  Select the **Friends** tab. Only Friends who are online will appear.
5.  Select your friend’s gamertag under **Joinable Friends** to enter their world.

## Check your game settings and subscription status

If you encounter any problems joining a friend's world, here are some things to check:

- **Sign in with your Microsoft account (console, mobile players):** You need to link or sign in with your Microsoft account. See [Linking Microsoft Accounts](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/29296773863181).
- **Enable multiplayer permissions**: Make sure you have permissions to join multiplayer games, especially if you are playing with a child account. See [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md).
- **Add your friend to your Friends list**: If you’re not already Minecraft friends, see [Add Friends to Your Friend List in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./Add-Friends-to-Your-Friend-List-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md).
- **Update to the newest Minecraft version**: You may encounter problems connecting to multiplayer games if all players aren’t playing the most recent Minecraft version. See our [Download & Install](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166490706957) section for information about manually updating Minecraft.
- **Subscribe to your platform’s online service (console only)**:  An active [Xbox Game Pass Core](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass), [Nintendo Switch Online](https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/), or [PlayStation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/) subscription is required for online play.
