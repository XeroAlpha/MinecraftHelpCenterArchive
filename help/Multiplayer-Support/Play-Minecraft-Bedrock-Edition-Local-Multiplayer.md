You can play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with your friends using the same console in split-screen mode or on different devices by connecting over your Local Area Network (LAN) connection. To learn about other ways to play with friends, see:

- [Play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition online in a multiplayer server](./Play-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Online-in-a-Multiplayer-Server.md)
- [Join a Friend’s Online World in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./Join-a-Friend-s-Online-World-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md)
- [Join a Friend's Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](../Create-or-Join-Realms/Join-a-Friend-s-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md)

## Play Minecraft in split-screen mode on a game console

Split-screen mode allows up to four players to play on the same screen at the same time.

1.  Launch Minecraft and join a world as Player One.
2.  Power on and connect the additional controller for the next player.
3.  Select the console user profile for the next player.
4.  Add another player by pressing the button as directed by the on-screen prompt.
5.  Repeat if desired for additional players.

## Play Minecraft on a Local Area Network (LAN) connection

You can play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with friends on your network connection using different devices if both are on the same network.

### Start a Local Area Network (LAN) connection session

1.  Select **Play** on the Minecraft title screen.
2.  Select the **pencil** icon on the world you want to play or create a new one.
3.  Go to the **Multiplayer** tab and make sure that **Multiplayer game** and **Visible to LAN Players** are enabled.
4.  Select the **Play** button to start the game.

### Join a Local Area Network (LAN) connection session

1.  Select **Play** on the Minecraft title screen.
2.  Go to the **Worlds tab** and look for available LAN worlds.
3.  Select the World you want to play to join.

**Note:** LAN worlds will have a blue LAN tag in the world description, next to the Creative/Survival game mode tag. Check to make sure that the “Hide LAN worlds” button in the upper-left isn’t toggled on.

## Check your game settings and subscription status

If you encounter any problems starting a multiplayer game, here are some things to check:

- **Sign in with your Microsoft account (console, mobile players):** You need to link or sign in with your Microsoft account. See [Linking Microsoft Accounts](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/29296773863181).
- **Enable multiplayer permissions**: Make sure you have permissions to join multiplayer games, especially if you are playing with a child account. See [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md).
- **Add your friend to your Friends list**: If you’re not already Minecraft friends, see [Add Friends to Your Friend List in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./Add-Friends-to-Your-Friend-List-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md).
- **Update to the newest Minecraft version**: You may encounter problems connecting to multiplayer games if all players aren’t playing the most recent Minecraft version. See our [Download & Install](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166490706957) section for information about manually updating Minecraft.
- **Subscribe to your platform’s online service (console only)**:  An active [Xbox Game Pass Core](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass), [Nintendo Switch Online](https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/), or [PlayStation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/) subscription is required for online play.
