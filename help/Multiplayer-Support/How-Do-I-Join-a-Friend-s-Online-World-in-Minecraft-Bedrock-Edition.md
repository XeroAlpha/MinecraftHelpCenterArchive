If you and your friend are playing on the same console, you can add each other to your friend’s list and invite each other using those menus. If you are on different platforms, like one on Xbox and the other on Nintendo Switch, here is how to add each other.

## How to add friends and join online games

1.  From the Minecraft title screen, press **Play**.
2.  Go to the **Friends** tab.
3.  Click **Add Friend**.
4.  On this page you can add your friend in multiple ways:  
    - **Search Gamertag**: Enter their Microsoft account gamertag in the Search Gamertag field.
    - **Scan QR Code**: Have your friend use their mobile device to scan your QR code to navigate to your Xbox Profile where they can add you as a friend.
    - **Share**: Press Share button to send your friend your own gamertag via chat or email so your friend can add you.
    - **Copy**: Press Copy to copy your own gamertag to share via chat, text, or email so your friend can search for you.
5.  You can join their active game by pressing the **Join** button in your **Friends** tab.

## Troubleshooting worlds not showing up for you to join

1.  Have the world owner to go into their world **Settings**.
2.  In the **Multiplayer** tab, make sure that Multiplayer Game is turned **on** (toggled to the right).
3.  For more troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Unable to Join Multiplayer Worlds in Minecraft](./Troubleshooting-Unable-to-Join-Multiplayer-Worlds-in-Minecraft.md).

Note: if you are playing Minecraft multiplayer on a console, you must be subscribed to either Xbox Game Pass Core, Nintendo Switch Online, or PlayStation Plus to be able to play with friends.
