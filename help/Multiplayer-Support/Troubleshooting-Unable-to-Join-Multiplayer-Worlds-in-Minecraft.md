Here are some suggestions to help you fix issues joining multiplayer worlds in Minecraft.

- **Check child account permissions:** If using a child account, visit [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md) to make sure the child account's permissions are set up correctly.
- **Check world settings with the host:** In Bedrock Edition, make sure **Multiplayer Game **is toggled on in the settings for the world you are trying to join.
  1.  Have the Realm owner select the **Pencil **icon next to the world in the world list.
  2.  Select **Multiplayer** from the Settings menu.
  3.  Toggle **Multiplayer Game** to the right.
- **Check your game version and system:** Make sure that you and the host are using the most recent release of Minecraft and restart your device.
- **Check your internet connection:** See [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md) for various internet connection troubleshooting tips.
- **Check subscription status:** Game consoles require a multiplayer subscription for online gaming. Find out more here:
