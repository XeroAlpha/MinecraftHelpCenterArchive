A Minecraft: Java Edition online server allows two or more players to play together and does not require a Realms subscription. To learn about other ways to play Java Edition with friends, see:

- - [Play Minecraft: Java Edition Multiplayer on a network connection](./Play-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Multiplayer-on-a-network-connection.md)
  - [Join a Friend's Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](../Create-or-Join-Realms/Join-a-Friend-s-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md)

## Join a Minecraft: Java Edition online server

After you've added a server, you can join in the future without adding it again.

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Multiplayer** from the main menu.
3.  Select a method for joining a server. You have several options:
    - Select an existing server from the list.
    - Click the **Direct Connection** button and enter a server address.
    - Click the **Add Server** button and enter the server address. Click **Done** when finished.
4.  Select **Join Server**.

Server addresses will be either an IP address (1.0.0.1) or a URL (www.example.com). For Minecraft servers that are safe to join and fun for all ages, check out [our official Minecraft server listing site](https://findmcserver.com/).
