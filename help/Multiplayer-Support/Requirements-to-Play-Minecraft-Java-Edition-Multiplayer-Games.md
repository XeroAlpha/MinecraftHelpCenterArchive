If you want to play multiplayer games or Realms in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition or Minecraft: Java Edition, you’ll need to meet the following requirements for a successful connection:

- **Matching game versions required**: You must have Minecraft: Bedrock Edition installed to join a Bedrock Edition server, Bedrock Edition Realm, or a locally hosted multiplayer game.  Players using Minecraft: Java Edition can only join games hosted using Minecraft: Java Edition.
- **Latest release recommended**: If you're not playing the most recent Minecraft version, you can encounter errors. See our [Download & Install \| Minecraft Help](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166490706957) section for how to update your game.
- **Minimum system specifications required for computers:** Computers used to play the game or host servers must meet or exceed the [System Requirements for Minecraft](../Download-Install/System-Requirements-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md) to avoid connection and performance issues.
- **Internet or LAN connection required:** Your gaming device must have a strong and stable connection to the internet.
- **Active online subscription required for consoles**: If you’re playing Minecraft multiplayer on a console, you must be subscribed to [Xbox Game Pass Core](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass), [Nintendo Switch Online](https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/), or [PlayStation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/) to play with friends.
- **Invitation required for Realms**: If you’re joining a Minecraft Realm, you will need to contact the Realm host to get an invite. See our [Create or Join Realms \| Minecraft Help](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/26104084764557) section for information.
- **Microsoft Account required for console, mobile**: You need to link or sign in with your Microsoft account. See our [Linking Microsoft Accounts \| Minecraft Help](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/29296773863181) section for information.
- **Enable multiplayer permissions**: Make sure you have permissions to join multiplayer games, especially if you're playing with a child account. See [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account in Minecraft](../Account-Settings/Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md).
