Minecraft: Java Edition has several different options for playing with friends. 

- **Java Edition Required**: You must have Minecraft: Java Edition installed to join a Java Edition server, Java Edition Realm, or a locally hosted multiplayer game.  Minecraft: Bedrock Edition players cannot join Java Edition games.
- **Minimum system specifications required**: Computers used to play the game or host servers must meet or exceed the minimum system requirements to avoid connection and performance issues. Visit [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc), scroll down, and select Compare Features for system requirements.
- **Matching game versions required**: We always recommend you use the most recent version of Minecraft: Java Edition to avoid any issues with performance or server connections. You may experience connection issues if your game version is different from the server version.
  - **Locate game version:** Your game version number appears in the bottom-left of the Minecraft main menu.
  - **Change game version:** See [How to Change Game Version for Minecraft: Java Edition](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/How-to-Change-Game-Version-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md).
