You can play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with friends by connecting devices over a Local Area Network (LAN) that does not have a connection to the internet. All players must be playing the most recent version of Minecraft using devices that support LAN play and be connected to the same network without an active internet connection.

**Note:** If your device is connected to the internet, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition defaults to online play, and you will not see LAN worlds on the Worlds tab.

## Host a Local Area Network (LAN) multiplayer game

1.  Verify that your device is connected to a local area network without an internet connection.
2.  Launch Minecraft and select **Play** on the Minecraft title screen.
3.  Select the **pencil** icon on the world you want to play or create a new one.
4.  Select the **Multiplayer** tab and make sure that **Multiplayer game** and **Visible to LAN Players** are both enabled.
5.  Select the **Play** button to start the game.

## Join a Local Area Network (LAN) multiplayer game

1.  Verify that your device is connected to the same local area network as the host computer without an internet connection.
2.  Verify that the host device has started a LAN game.
3.  Launch Minecraft and select **Play** on the Minecraft title screen.
4.  Select the **Worlds tab** and look for worlds that display "LAN" next to the name.
5.  Select the World you want to play to join.

**Note:** If LAN worlds are not shown, click the network button at the top of the Worlds tab to toggle the LAN game display.
