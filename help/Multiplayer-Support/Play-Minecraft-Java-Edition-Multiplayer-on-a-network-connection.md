You can play Minecraft: Java Edition with friends on a Local Area Network (LAN) by joining a world hosted on the same network connection. All players must be playing the most recent version of Minecraft using devices that support LAN play and be connected to the same local network. LAN games will display on the Multiplayer screen for guests even if they're connected to the internet through the local network. To learn about other ways to play Java Edition with friends, see:
