A Minecraft: Java Edition online server allows two or more players to play together and does not require a Realms subscription. To learn about other ways to play Java Edition with friends, see:

- - [Play Minecraft: Java Edition Multiplayer on a network connection](./How-to-Play-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Multiplayer.md)
  - [How to Join a Friend's Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](../Create-or-Join-Realms/How-to-Join-a-Friend-s-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md)

## Add a Minecraft: Java Edition server to your server list

To join a Minecraft: Java Edition server, you'll need the server's owner to provide the website domain or IP address. After you have the server information, follow the instructions below to add the server to the list in Minecraft.

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Multiplayer** from the main menu.
3.  Select **Add Server**.
4.  Enter a Server Name and the Server Address. The Server Address will be either an IP address (1.0.0.1) or a URL (www.example.com).
5.  Select **Done**. The server should now be saved on your Play Multiplayer screen.

For Minecraft servers that are safe to join and fun for all ages, check out [our official Minecraft server listing site](https://findmcserver.com/).

## Join a Minecraft: Java Edition online server

After you've added a server, you can join in the future without adding it again.

1.  Launch Minecraft.
2.  Select **Multiplayer** from the main menu.
3.  Select the server you added.
4.  Select **Join Server**.

You can also select Direct Connection from the Multiplayer screen if you have the address and don't want to save the server in your list.

## Requirements to play Minecraft: Java Edition Multiplayer

- **Java Edition Required**: You must have Minecraft: Java Edition installed to join a Java Edition server.  Minecraft: Bedrock Edition players cannot join Java Edition servers.
- **Minimum system specifications required**: Computers used to play the game or host servers must meet or exceed the minimum system requirements to avoid connection and performance issues. Visit [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc), scroll down, and select Compare Features for system requirements.
- **Matching game versions required**: We always recommend you use the most recent version of Minecraft: Java Edition to avoid any issues with performance or server connections. You may experience connection issues if your game version is different from the server version.
  - You can locate your game version number in the bottom-left of the Minecraft main menu after you launch the game.
  - If you need to change your game version to match the server’s, see [How to Change Game Version for Minecraft: Java Edition](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/How-to-Change-Game-Version-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md).
