One of the best ways to experience Minecraft: Java Edition with friends is playing through servers. Whether you want to use a public server or have a private one your friend made, here is how you can join.

## How to join a server in Minecraft: Java Edition

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Multiplayer**.
3.  Select **Add Server**.
4.  Name the server whatever you want so you can tell it apart from others in your server list.
5.  Copy and paste the server address.
    - Public servers will look like a website domain (play.mojang.com).
    - Private servers will be a string of numbers and dots (IP address).
6.  Select **Done**.
7.  Click the server in your list.
8.  Select **Join Server**.
