Your character name that displays in-game is associated with the version of Minecraft you play or the game console you use.

### Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Gamertag

Your in-game name is the Gamertag associated with your Xbox account. Here’s how to update it:

1.  Go to the [Change Xbox Gamertag](https://social.xbox.com/changegamertag) page.
2.  Enter your new gamertag.
3.  Click on **Check Availability** and follow the on-screen instruction.

### Minecraft: Java Edition Java Profile Name

Your in-game name is your Java profile name and not your Gamertag. The only time you will see your Minecraft Java profile name is in-game and in your Minecraft account settings. You can update it by following these steps:

1.  Visit [My Minecraft Games](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login) on Minecraft.net and sign in with your Microsoft account.
2.  Under Minecraft: Java Edition, select **Change Profile Name**.
3.  Select your new name and click the **Change Your Profile Name** button.
4.  You must [sign out completely](../Account-Sign-In/How-to-Sign-Out-of-Minecraft.md) and then sign back in to refresh your profile's authentication and connection with our servers.

**Note:** You can change your Java profile name once every 30 days. If you change your mind after changing your Java profile name, you can go back to your old name after waiting 30 days.

### Minecraft for Nintendo Switch 

Your in-game name for Minecraft is displayed as your Nintendo account nickname. Visit [Nintendo Support](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63086/~/how-to-change-nintendo-account-nickname) to change your nickname, or follow these steps directly on your Switch:

1.  Start your Switch.
2.  Select your profile page in the top left corner.
3.  Go to **Profile** tab.
4.  Select the **pencil icon** next to the name to change it.
