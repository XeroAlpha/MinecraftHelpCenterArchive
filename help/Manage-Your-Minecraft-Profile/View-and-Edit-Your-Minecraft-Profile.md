Your Minecraft Profile is your hub for viewing game-play history and statistics, [screenshots](./Manage-Your-Screenshots-on-Your-Minecraft-Profile.md), [achievements](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Unlock-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Achievements.md), and your [friends list](../Multiplayer-Support/Add-Friends-to-Your-Friend-List-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md).

## View your Minecraft Profile

1.  Launch Minecraft: Bedrock edition.
2.  Click the **Profile** button on the launch screen.

## Change your profile image

Your Minecraft Profile Image reflects the active character you have in Minecraft and also displays on your Profile button. If you haven’t signed in recently, it may appear like a block or a grey square. To change your character’s skin, see [Equip Minecraft Character Creator Items and Skins in the Dressing Room](../Managing-Marketplace-Content/Equip-Minecraft-Character-Creator-Items-and-Skins-in-the-Dressing-Room.md).

## Manage the ability to invite friends and view profiles

Microsoft and Xbox family settings allow you to control who can view profiles and how players connect with friends online. See these articles for information:
