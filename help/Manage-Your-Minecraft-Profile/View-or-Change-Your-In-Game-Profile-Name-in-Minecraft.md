Your character name that displays in-game is associated with the version of Minecraft you play or the game console you use.

## Change your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition gamertag

When playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition using a Microsoft account, your in-game character name is the [gamertag](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/profile/change-xbox-live-gamertag) associated with your Xbox/Microsoft account.

### Change your Gamertag online

1.  Visit [Xbox.com](https://www.xbox.com/) and sign in with your Microsoft account.
2.  Select **My Account** to view your Xbox profile.
3.  Select the pencil icon next to your Gamertag to make changes.

### Change Gamertag on Xbox

1.  Press the **Xbox **button on your controller and select **Profile & system** from the guide.
2.  Select your Xbox profile (or select **Choose a profile** and sign in to your account).
3.  Select **My profile **\> **Customize profile**, and then select your current gamertag.

## Change your Minecraft: Java Edition profile name

When playing Minecraft: Java Edition, your in-game character name is your Java profile name and not your gamertag (although, they can be the same). 

1.  Visit [All Games](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile) on Minecraft.net and sign in with your Microsoft account. 
2.  Under Minecraft: Java Edition, select **Change Profile Name**.
3.  Enter your new profile name and select **Change Your Profile Name** to finalize the change. 

**Note:** You can change your Java profile name once every 30 days. If you change your mind after changing your Java profile name, you can go back to your old name after waiting 30 days.

## Change your Nintendo Switch nickname for Minecraft

Your in-game name for Minecraft is displayed as your Nintendo account nickname. Visit [Nintendo Support](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63086/~/how-to-change-nintendo-account-nickname) to change your nickname, or follow these steps directly on your Switch:

1.  Start your Switch.
2.  Select your profile page in the top left corner.
3.  Go to the **Profile** tab.
4.  Select the **pencil icon** next to your profile name to change it.
