Any in-game screenshots you take can be viewed and managed from the Minecraft screenshots folder. Here’s how to take screenshots, where to find them, and how to delete them.

## How to take a screenshot in Minecraft: Java Edition

- **Select F2 to take a screenshot from your point of view**: F2 is the default to take an in-game screenshot.
- **Select F1 to hide the heads-up display (HUD)**: Select F1 before you take a screenshot to hide Minecraft’s UI.
- **Select F5 to toggle perspectives**: Switch between first and third person views before you take a screenshot for different angles.
