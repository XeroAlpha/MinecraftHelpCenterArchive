If you are playing Minecraft signed in with a child account and receive the error “You cannot play online multiplayer because of how your Microsoft account is setup,” the adult Family Account owner will need to review and change your privacy settings to join multiplayer games or Realms.

See [Managing Multiplayer Game Access For A Child Account In Minecraft](./Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md) for more information.

### Required Online Subscriptions for Consoles
