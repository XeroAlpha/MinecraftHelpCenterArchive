If you are playing Minecraft signed in with a child account on a gaming console and receive the error “You cannot play online multiplayer because of how your Microsoft account is setup,” the adult Family Account owner should start by confirming your Online Subscription for your console is active.

### Required Online Subscriptions for Consoles

- [Xbox Game Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass)
- [Nintendo Switch Online](https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/)
- [PlayStation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/)

If you still receive this error or are not playing on a console, review and change your privacy settings to join multiplayer games or Realms by visiting [Managing Multiplayer Game Access For A Child Account In Minecraft](./Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md).
