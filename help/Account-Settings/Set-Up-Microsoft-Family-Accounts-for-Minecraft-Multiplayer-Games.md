Child accounts are all accounts for those under the age of 16 for the US & EU, or 19 for South Korea. If there isn't an adult account associated with the child account, the adult must make a Microsoft account and associate the already-created child account with it. Only parent accounts can modify settings.

## Follow these steps to set up your family accounts:

1.  1.  Go to the [Microsoft Family homepage](https://account.microsoft.com/family/home) and sign in with the parent’s account.
    2.  If there is no family group yet, select **Create a family group**.
    3.  Select **Add a family member**.
    4.  Create a new child account or enter the child’s existing email account.
    5.  Once signed in, your Family homepage will update with the child account.

Be sure to download the [Xbox Family app](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/family-settings-app) for easy account management.

See [Managing multiplayer game access for a child account in Minecraft](./Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md) to learn more on enabling multiplayer and communication settings.
