Follow these steps to update child account settings that control access to multiplayer games such as Minecraft Realms and Minecraft Dungeons and manage online communication permissions.  
1. Go to [Xbox Privacy & Online Safety Page](https://account.xbox.com/en-us/Settings?rtc=1&activetab=main%3aprivacytab) and sign in with the parent account.

2\. Select the child’s account among the family members at the top.

3\. Select **Xbox Series X\|S, Xbox One, and Windows 10 devices Online Safety**.

4\. Choose the following settings:

- Set **Join multiplayer games** to **allow**.

- Set **Play with players outside of Xbox Live** to **allow** if you want to be able to crossplay on other consoles.

- Set **Create and join clubs** to **allow** to access to Realms Stories.

- Set **You can upload captures to Xbox Live** to **allow** if you want to post screenshots on Realms Stories.

5\. Click **Submit** and wait for the page to reload. After you save these settings, restart Minecraft for them to take effect in your game.

**Note:** If the child account that was adjusted was playing Minecraft while the settings were being updated, you will need to close and restart Minecraft for the changes to take effect.

You can also manage child account settings on the [Xbox Family App](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/family-online-safety/family-settings-app/manage-child-content-in-the-Xbox-Family-Setting-app).
