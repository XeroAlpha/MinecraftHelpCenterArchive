When purchasing games from the Microsoft store, you have the option to save payment details to your account for future use. When you make a purchase, payment information is transmitted to our servers over a secure connection.

Because this information is encrypted, Microsoft does not have direct access to your credit card details. This information can be sent to our payment partners to process a transaction but cannot be read by us. This means that if your Microsoft account were to be compromised, your card details would not be at risk.

## VIEW OR REMOVE YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS

You can view your payment details at any time on your Microsoft Account Settings using these steps:

1.  Go to [Microsoft Account Payment Options](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/payments) page.
2.  Sign into your Microsoft account.
3.  From here you can Add a new payment method or Remove payment method.

## CHANGING PAYMENT FOR RECURRING SUBSCRIPTIONS

A saved credit card is required for recurring purchases, such as monthly payments of Minecraft Realms. If you'd like to switch the card that is set up for recurring payments, delete the currently saved card, then add a new card to your profile. You can view more information on your Minecraft subscriptions in [How to Update Your Payment Method for Minecraft Realms](../Manage-Realms-Subscriptions/How-to-Update-Your-Payment-Method-for-Minecraft-Realms.md).

If you still have questions, check out [Who to Contact with your Minecraft Questions](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Who-to-contact-with-your-Minecraft-support-questions.md).
