Minecraft: Bedrock edition allows you to manage who can view your child’s profile online, who they can talk to, and what they can share while playing the game. Minecraft uses Microsoft and Xbox family safety features to manage parental controls even if you do not play Minecraft on an Xbox. 

## Social settings options for a Child in Xbox Settings Online

The Xbox Settings "Privacy & online safety" page allows you to manage what your child can do and how others are allowed to interact with your child. Here are some of the key settings for managing chat, connecting with other players, and what can be shared:

### Your Child can

- **You can see and upload community creations:** Control if your child can participate in Realms Stories and share screen shots of in-game activity in their profile. 
- **See other people's Xbox profiles**: Adjust whether your child can view other people's Minecraft profiles and add them to their [Friends list](../Multiplayer-Support/Add-Friends-to-Your-Friend-List-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md). Profiles may include their game history and achievements, bio, and other personal information.
- **You can communicate outside of Xbox with voice & text:** Adjust if your child can communicate using chat with people in Minecraft games.

### Others can

- **Others can see your friends and following lists:** Allowed groups can see your child's Minecraft Friends list.
- **Others can send you friend requests:** Controls if others can see your child listed online and send requests to join a Minecraft Friends list.

### Privacy & Safety setting descriptions

- **Everyone**: No restrictions on who can contact the account owner, use a feature or access content.
- **Friends**: Only people on the account owner's [Friends list](../Multiplayer-Support/Add-Friends-to-Your-Friend-List-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) in Minecraft have access.
- **Only me:** Only the account owner can view the information online or access the feature.
- **Allow:** Enables the specific feature.
- **Block**: Prevents us of a feature or outside access by anyone.
