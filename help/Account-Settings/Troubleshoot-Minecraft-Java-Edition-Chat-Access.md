If you cannot access chat in Minecraft: Java Edition, you may need to adjust your [Xbox Settings for Privacy & online safety](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/user/settings/privacy-and-safety?rtc=1&activetab=main:privacytab). Any settings you change on your Xbox/Microsoft account will apply to all games that use the settings.

## Update Xbox Chat Settings Online

1.  Visit [Privacy & online safety on the Xbox Settings page](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/user/settings/privacy-and-safety?rtc=1&activetab=main:privacytab).
2.  Sign in using an Adult or Parent/Guardian account. 
3.  Select the tile for the account you want to manage.
4.  Select the **Privacy tab** on the account settings screen.
5.  Set the following settings to **Everyone** to allow full access to chat:
    - **"Gamertag" can:** You can communicate outside of Xbox with voice and text
    - **Others can:** Others can communicate with voice, text or invites
6.  Select **Submit** and wait for the page to reload.
7.  Sign out of Minecraft and restart the game to refresh your permissions.

**Note:** If you adjust these settings to “Friends,” chat access is “Blocked” in Minecraft: Java Edition.

Parents and guardians can manage the settings for child accounts that are part of a family group. See these pages for more information:

## UK Age Verification Requirements

Microsoft account holders within the United Kingdom are required to verify the account owner’s age. Access to chat in Minecraft: Java Edition may be restricted for unverified accounts. See [UK Age Verification Requirements for Microsoft accounts](https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/family-online-safety/online-safety/UK-age-verification) for information. You may need to follow the steps above to restore chat access after verifying an account.
