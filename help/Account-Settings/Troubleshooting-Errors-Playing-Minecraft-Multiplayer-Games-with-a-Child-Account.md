If you are playing Minecraft signed in with a child account and receive the error “You cannot play online multiplayer because of how your Microsoft account is setup,” the adult Family Account owner will need to review and change your privacy settings to join multiplayer games or Realms.

See [Managing Multiplayer Game Access for a Child Account In Minecraft](./Managing-Multiplayer-Game-Access-for-a-Child-Account-in-Minecraft.md) for more information on managing permissions for the child account.

- **Error codes**: If you are getting an error code, see [Error Code Troubleshooting for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Error-Code-Troubleshooting-for-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) to look into various fixes.
- **Internet connection**: If you may be encountering internet connection issues, see [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md).
- **Multiplayer troubleshooting**: You can also see [Troubleshooting Unable to Join Multiplayer Worlds in Minecraft](../Multiplayer-Support/Troubleshoot-Unable-to-Join-Multiplayer-Games-in-Minecraft.md) for more potential fixes.
