Your character name that displays in-game is associated with the version of Minecraft you play or the game console you use.

### Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Gamertag

Your in-game name is the Gamertag associated with your Xbox account. Here’s how to update it:

1.  Go to the [Change Xbox Gamertag](https://social.xbox.com/changegamertag) page.
2.  Enter your new gamertag.
3.  Click on **Check Availability** and follow the on-screen instruction.

### Minecraft: Java Edition Java Profile Name

Your in-game name is your Java profile name and not your Gamertag. The only time you will see your Minecraft Java profile name is in-game and in your Minecraft account settings. You can update it by following these steps:

1.  Go to the [My Minecraft Games](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login) Page.
2.  Under Minecraft: Java Edition, select the **Profile Name** option.
3.  Select your new name and press **Change Profile Name**.
4.  You must [sign out completely](../Account-Sign-In/How-to-Sign-Out-of-Minecraft.md) and then sign back in to refresh your profile's authentication and connection with our servers.

Note: If you change your mind after changing your name, you can go back to your old name within 30 days.

### Minecraft for Nintendo Switch 

Your in-game name for Minecraft is displayed as your Nintendo account nickname. Visit [Nintendo Support](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63086/~/how-to-change-nintendo-account-nickname) to change your nickname, or follow these steps directly on your Switch:

1.  Start your Switch.
2.  Select your profile page in the top left corner.
3.  Go to **Profile** tab.
4.  Select the **pencil icon** next to the name to change it.
