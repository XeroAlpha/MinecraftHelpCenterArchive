Minecraft: Bedrock edition allows you to manage who can view your child’s profile online, who they can talk to, and what they can share while playing the game. Minecraft uses Microsoft and Xbox family safety features to manage parental controls even if you do not play Minecraft on an Xbox. 

## Settings options for Privacy & Online Safety on a child account 

The Privacy settings page is divided into two sections. The top section allows you to manage what your child can do. The "Others can" section controls how your child’s profile appears to others. Here are some of the key settings for managing chat, connecting with other players, and what can be shared:

- **You can see and upload community creations:** Control whose community creations you want your child to see. Blocking this may affect whether your child can upload their own creations in some games.
- **See other people's Xbox profiles**: Adjust whether your child can view other people's Minecraft profiles, which might include their game history and achievements, bio, and other personal info.
- **You can communicate outside of Xbox with voice & text:** Adjust if your child can communicate using chat with people on Minecraft.

Each feature above can have the following restrictions:

- **Everyone**: No restrictions on who can use a feature or access content.
- **Friends**: Your account can receive all text chat and receive all invites from anyone on your Friends list in Minecraft.
- **Block**: Your account will not receive any text chat or receive any invites from anyone in Minecraft.
