While playing Minecraft with other players online, you may want to customize your online chat experience. Your in-game chat experience is managed through your Microsoft Xbox Live account settings.

## How to change your Minecraft online chat settings 

1.  Visit your Xbox Live account settings.
2.  Click on the **Privacy** tab on the top of the page.
3.  Scroll down to **Others can communicate with voice, text or invites** in the **Others can** section.

From here, you’ll find the following options.

- **Everyone**: Your account can receive all text chat and receive all invites from anyone in Minecraft.
- **Friends**: Your account can receive all text chat and receive all invites from anyone on your Friends list in Minecraft.
- **Block**: Your account will not receive any text chat or receive any invites from anyone in Minecraft: Java Edition.

After you adjust your settings, make sure to close and relaunch Minecraft to make sure your settings apply in-game. We also recommend signing out using the Minecraft Launcher and then signing back in when you relaunch Minecraft.
