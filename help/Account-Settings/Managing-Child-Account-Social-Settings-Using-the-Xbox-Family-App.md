Minecraft: Bedrock edition allows you to use the Xbox Family App to manage who can view your child’s profile online, who they can talk to, and what they can share while playing the game. Minecraft uses Microsoft and Xbox family safety features to manage parental controls even if you do not play Minecraft on an Xbox. 

## Social settings options for a Child account in the Xbox Family App

When you click on the Settings icon for a child account, you'll see the following setting options related to Minecraft chat and social features that you can control. Tap on the setting name to see the moderation options.

### Social

- **Add friends and follow others:** Decide if your child account can add people to their [Friends list](../Multiplayer-Support/How-to-Add-Friends-to-Your-Friend-List-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) and follow others in Minecraft.
- **Manage online communication:** Choose who your child can communicate with using the chat function in Minecraft.

### Content Restrictions

### Clubs
