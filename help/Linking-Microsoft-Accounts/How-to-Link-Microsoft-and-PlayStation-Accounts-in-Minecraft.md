If you want to play with friends on different platforms or join Realms on Minecraft for PlayStation, you will need to link a Microsoft account to your PlayStation Network (PSN) account. Here is how to do that.

### How to connect your Microsoft account to PlayStation in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

1.  Launch Minecraft on your PlayStation.
2.  Select **Sign in with a Microsoft account** on the title screen.
3.  Visit the [code redemption site on a browser](https://login.live.com/oauth20_remoteconnect.srf).
4.  Input the code that your game is displaying.
5.  Sign in to the Microsoft account you want associated with your PlayStation account.

**Note:** only one Microsoft account can be associated with any PlayStation account at any one time. If the account you are trying to sign into has already been linked, you will need to use a different one.

After your Microsoft account has been signed in, you will be able to access your Realms and non-exclusive Marketplace content from other Bedrock versions on your PlayStation. However, any Minecoins you purchased on another version of Bedrock will not be usable on PlayStation. Only Minecraft Tokens can be used in the Minecraft Store on PlayStation. See [What are Minecraft Tokens?](../Minecraft-Marketplace-Content/What-are-Minecraft-Tokens.md) for more info.
