If you are playing Minecraft on an Android or Apple device, you can crossplay with others who are on console or PC and carry over your Marketplace purchases between devices. To enable this, you will need to link a Microsoft account. Here is how to do that.

## Linking a Microsoft account to Android or Apple devices in Minecraft

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Sign In**.
3.  Select **Sign In** on the new window that opens.
4.  Enter your Microsoft account info or select a pre-saved account.
5.  Select **Letâ€™s Go**.

Once your account has been linked, give your game a few seconds to load your profile and you can find your previously purchased content in the Marketplace.
