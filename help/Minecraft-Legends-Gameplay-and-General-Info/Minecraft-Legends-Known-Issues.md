## Launch Day Issues - April 18, 2023

- When interacting or standing near a player-built structure, the number of resources being gathered disappears from the HUD. The resources are still being gathered and moving away from structures will once again display the resource amounts.
- Players may not see Marketplace skins of other players when playing multiplayer.
- The Horde of the Hunt boss may despawn if the player abandons a village attack.
- On PC, clicking on ‘View Profile’ won’t open a player’s gamercard.
- Rarely, the Night Beacon Base can generate in the middle of a lake, making it impossible to reach.
- Rarely, the final Horde of the Bastion base might not spawn during campaign.
- The ‘Wake the Firsts’ improvement cannot be unlocked towards the end of campaign if none of the Firsts have been interacted with.
- On Steam, accepting a multiplayer invite through Xbox Game Bar will open the Windows Store. Accept multiplayer invites through Steam instead to prevent this.
- On Steam, an incorrect “connection has timed out” error appears if the Xbox account has ‘join multiplayer games’ privileges disabled.
- When searching for a Versus Mode game in matchmaking on PC, clicking anywhere outside the matchmaking prompt will cancel the matchmaking attempt.
