Minecraft Legends features a vast array of units to command. Beating the piglins requires a deep understanding of each unit’s strengths and weaknesses. This article details the various unit types you can acquire and how they’re best used to win any encounter!

**Note: This article spoils units that you unlock later in the game. If you want the unit types to remain a surprise, we suggest you play through the game before reading onward.**

## Plank Golem

Plank golems are basic ranged units. They shoot endless bursts of arrows at enemies and structures.

## Cobblestone Golem

Cobblestone golems are basic melee units. Their strength lies in taking down enemy structures much faster than other golem types.

## Grindstone Golem

Grindstone golems bust through large groups of lower rank piglins, making them an ideal choice for taking down hordes.

## Mossy Golem

Mossy golems don’t attack enemies. Instead, they heal your units by spraying them with restorative water.

## Zombie

Zombies can take a ton of damage, making them great unit to lead the charge into any conflict.

## Skeleton

Skeletons are much more powerful ranged units than plank golems, though they don’t attack nearly as fast. These units stand at the edge of a fight and fire arrow volleys into enemy lines. 

## Creeper

Creepers are just as you’d expect – fantastic units for blowing up enemy structures in a hurry. However, they’re gone after one use, so make sure to command these special units effectively.
