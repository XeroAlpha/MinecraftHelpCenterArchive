**Note: This article spoils some of the Improvement Hub upgrades that you unlock later in the game. If you want the upgrades to remain a surprise, we suggest you play through the game before reading onward.**

## Resource Gathering

Resource gathering improvements, such as 'Gather Iron,' 'Gather Redstone,' or 'Gather Diamond,' increase how many resources of one type you can hold. Upgrading certain resource types is a vital step toward building new structures.

## Allay Storage

While specific resource-gathering improvements are required for rarer resources like iron and diamond, upgrading your Allay Storage provides more room for general resources such as wood, stone, and prismarine. Some upgrades will require additional resource storage to build.

## Cure Netherrack

Cure Netherrack provides allays with the ability to convert netherrack into a safe block for building structures on top of. It's a great way to push closer to an enemy base.

## Flames of Creation

Each Flames of Creation upgrade increases the total limit of *spawned* mobs you can have in the world at one time. Spawned mobs are mobs you create using a Spawner.

## Banner

Each Banner upgrade increases the number of *existing* mobs you can rally and lead around.

## Shared Village Chests

An essential early-game upgrade, the Shared Village Chests improvement ensures that village chests are now connected, so you can gather all villager resources from any chest in the Overworld.

## Abundant Allays

For each Abundant Allays improvement you build, you'll earn two additional build allays and two gather allays.

## Expert Carpentry

This one-time improvement doubles the speed of the Improvement Hut, and increases the construction speed of all structures by 50%.

## Expert Mason

This one-time improvement doubles the speed of building conversions from wood to stone via the Masonry. It also increases the aura range of defensive structures by 50%.
