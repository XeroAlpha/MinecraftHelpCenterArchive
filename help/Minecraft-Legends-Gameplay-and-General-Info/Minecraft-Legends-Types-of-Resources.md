Many of the resources from Minecraft have carried over into Minecraft Legends! This article will detail the resources available in Minecraft Legends and how they can benefit you.

Remember, you can always look at the in-game Songbook to review any resources you’ve already unlocked, as well as available structures and upgrades.

**Note: This article spoils resources that you unlock later in the game. If you want the in-game resources to remain a surprise, we suggest you play through it before reading onward.**

Resources are a very important part of Minecraft Legends. They’re required to build structures, spawn units, and upgrade your abilities. While many of them can be found while exploring the Overworld, you also earn resources for defeating enemies and protecting villages.

If you need a specific resource, check a village chest or consult the Map to see where to mine it.

## Wood

Wood is the Overworld’s most common resource. It’s used to build walls, defensive structures, and all sorts of useful designs.

## Stone

The Overworld’s other most common resource, stone, is great for building upgrades to enhance structures. It’s also necessary to build some more advanced designs, such as the redstone launcher.

## Iron

Just like in Minecraft, iron is a bit harder to find in Minecraft Legends than resources like wood and stone. However, the effort is worth the reward. Iron is required for building some of the game’s best structures.

## Coal

Coal is one of the rarer resources in Minecraft Legends, but it’s also one of the most valuable. You’ll find coal in most of the game’s more explosive recipes.

## Redstone

Redstone is one of the most required resources for offensive structures, like the battle drum. Always keep some handy when making a push on the enemy base.

## Diamond

Diamond is an incredibly rare resource, but one that’s invaluable to any defensive plan. Keep diamond in stock for ice traps and the spyglass tower, especially. 

## Prismarine

Allays can’t gather prismarine. Instead, this valuable resource comes from destroying piglin structures and bases. Use it to upgrade your capabilities at the Well of Fate.

## Lapis

Lapis is found in village chests or earned by defeating piglins. It’s most commonly used for spawning units.

## Gold

Gold cannot be gathered like most other resources but is obtained from destroying piglin bases. Gold is used to build some upgrades at the Well of Fate in campaign but is not present in Versus Mode.
