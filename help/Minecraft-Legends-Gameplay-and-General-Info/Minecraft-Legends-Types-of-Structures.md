Minecraft Legends features all types of structures for you to build, adding to your defensive and offensive capabilities. Read on for an extensive list of structures you can build.

**Note: This article spoils structures that you unlock later in the game. If you want the in-game structures to remain a surprise, we suggest you play through it before reading onward.**

## Extendable Wall

The extendable wall creates a barrier between enemies and whatever you’re trying to protect. Make sure you fortify these walls with other defenses by converting them to stone (see Masonry below), as these will often be the piglins’ first target.

## Ramp

The ramp is for building stairs or bridges to access new areas. This is a fantastic way to add some verticality to your base, or to create a back way into the enemy fortification. The ramp is the only structure that can be built on netherrack, so use that to your advantage!

## Gate

Build a gate in between your walls for easy access in and out. The gate will stay closed for enemy units, too!

## Arrow Tower

The most common defensive structure, the arrow tower unloads arrows against enemies in its vicinity.

## Carpenter Hut

The carpenter hut repairs structures within its area-of-effect zone. However, it can only repair standing structures. If a structure is destroyed, the carpenter hut will not repair it.

## Ice Trap 

Enemies who run over ice traps will be frozen in place for a short period. Pair these with the arrow tower for a devastating surprise.

## Masonry

Upgrades wooden structures to stone, making them much more resistant to enemy attacks.

## Scatter Tower

The scatter tower has a shorter range than the arrow tower, but it unleashes more arrows at a faster rate. Use these to defend your more valuable base structures.

## Protecter Tower

The protecter tower defends against large enemy projectiles – ideal for shielding walls from long-range attacks.

## Redstone Launcher

The redstone launcher hurls TNT at a targeted area. To use it, walk up to the launcher and interact with it, choose where to fire, and confirm. The launcher can hurl multiple TNT blocks before needing to reload.

## Kaboomery

The kaboomery adds explosive damage to any towers in its vicinity, making them more powerful.

## Spyglass Overlook

The spyglass overlook extends the range of nearby defensive structures, such as redstone launchers and arrow towers.

## Battle Drum

The battle drum increases the firing speed of nearby defensive structures, like arrow towers and scatter towers.

## Lapis Flag

The lapis flag is a multiplayer only structure. Building it provides a constant flow of Lapis to you and your team’s reserves.
