## Minecraft Legends PvP Tips and Tricks

- Coordinate with your team! If one of you is gathering a ton of wood and stone, ask another teammate to focus on other resources. This way, you’re better prepared to react to any situation.
- Pay attention to the piglin armies. If they’re attacking an enemy player, use that to your advantage and attack at the same time to overwhelm them.
- Always gather resources. While it’s easy to get distracted with so much going on, be sure you’re making the effort to gather resources as you roam around. 
- Counter enemy armies. If you see an enemy army made up of mostly melee units, spawn in some ranged ones to take them down from a distance. Outsmarting the enemy team is the best way to win.
- Building a forward base is a great way to keep some pressure on the enemy and see what they’re doing.
