## This article goes alongside a video tutorial for Minecraft Legends. For the best tutorial experience, please read the following text alongside **[this video](https://youtu.be/HNj44gXOCoU)**. 

## Using Banner View

Banner View allows you to tactfully order your units into battle. You can use it to send out units one at a time, select specifically ranged or melee units, or to choose one target for all your units to attack.

### Xbox Controller

- Hold Right Trigger to enter Banner View. 
- Drag the right stick to hover over a target.
- Use the d-pad to select a set of units.
- Once your units are chosen and you’re hovered over a target, hold the ‘B’ button to have your units charge into that direction, or hold down the ‘Y’ button to have them focus that specific target, ignoring any enemies or obstacles along the way.
- You can also single press the ‘Y’ or ‘B’ buttons to send one unit at a time.

### Mouse and Keyboard

- Hold ‘CTRL’ to enter Banner View. 
- Drag the mouse to hover over a target.
- Either scroll the mouse wheel or use the number keys 1-5 to select melee mobs, ranged mobs, or your entire set of units.
- Once your units are chosen and you’re hovered over a target, hold the left mouse button to have your units charge into that direction, or hold down the right mouse button to have them focus that specific target, ignoring any enemies or obstacles along the way.
- You can also single press the left or the right mouse button to send one unit at a time.

## Commanding Overworld Units

While other tutorials have focused on commanding units you’ve spawned so far, you can also command units that already exist in the Overworld. In this video, you’ll learn that you can command units like creepers, skeletons, and zombies that you find while roaming the Overworld. Simply rally them the same way you’d rally spawned units, and command them in the exact same ways.

## Destroying a Nether Portal

In previous tutorials, you took down various piglin settlements. Specifically, the gated outpost. Now, you’re up against a larger version of the gated outpost: a piglin base with a massive Nether portal inside. 

The Nether portal consistently spawns piglins and won’t stop until you destroy it. Along the way, you’re facing Nether spreaders, blaze rod towers, gates, and more. This is the ultimate tutorial challenge, and Minecraft Legends provides you with zombies, creepers, and skeletons to help out alongside your spawned golems.

If you’re struggling, make sure to look back at these tutorial videos and make sure you’re remembering all of the features and capabilities at your disposal. You can do it! And good luck out there.
