## Customizing Your Hotbar

You'll earn all sorts of melodies throughout Minecraft Legends, including new resources to gather, new spawners to create, and new structures to build. Eventually, you'll have so many that they won't all fit in your hotbar. This is where customizing your hotbar comes into play, allowing you to switch up which melodies are easily accessible to you.

### Xbox Controller

-   Open up your songbook by clicking the Right Stick in.
-   Use your left and right bumpers to navigate between the tabs on the top left of the songbook. Each tab represents a separate hotbar.
-   For this example, navigate to the far right tab representing the Improvements hotbar.
-   Hover over the 'Gather Iron' improvement and select it with 'A'.
-   Pick which section on the hotbar you'd like to place the 'Gather Iron' improvement.

### Mouse and Keyboard
