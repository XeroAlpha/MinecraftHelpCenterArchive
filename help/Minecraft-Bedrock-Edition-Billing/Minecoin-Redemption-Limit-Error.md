When redeeming two separate codes for the same value of Minecoins in a row, you might receive the ‘you already own this product’ error. If that’s the case, follow these steps to solve the issue:

1.  Once you’ve redeemed your first code, sign into the account you’re redeeming Minecoins with **before redeeming the second code** and head to the Marketplace.
2.  Select your Minecoin balance to move the Minecoins into your account.
3.  Redeem the second code.

These steps should solve any Minecoin redemption trouble you’ve been experiencing. If you’re still having Minecoin redemption problems, please get in [touch with Minecraft Support](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001225811).
