## What is Minecraft Marketplace?

Minecraft Marketplace is a way to find and purchase community-made content from within the game. You purchase content in the Marketplace using a currency called Minecoins (or Tokens, for PlayStation® users), which you can purchase in the game store.

For an introduction and an overview of Marketplace, please visit our [quick guide](https://minecraft.net/article/marketplace-quick-guide).

You can discover and purchase new avatar skins, textures, and worlds made by creators in the Minecraft community directly in-game. With Minecraft Marketplace, we\'ve made it safer and easier to purchase community-made content for Minecraft. Buy content once and enjoy it on any device running Minecraft [except for Minecraft: Java Edition]{.underline}.

Available for purchase in the game store, Minecoins let you buy content from creators in the Minecraft Marketplace, which is safer and more secure. Minecoins are kept in your virtual wallet and can be used across devices when you're signed into Xbox Live.

\*With your free Xbox Live player profile, each purchase you make is also tied to your account. Your purchased content does not expire, it's yours to keep. You can play with friends and show off your marketplace maps and skins!

## Which devices is Minecraft Marketplace available on?

Minecraft Marketplace is available on any device running the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft.

### Supported Systems and Devices

-   Amazon Fire TV
-   Amazon Kindle Fire
-   Android
-   Chromebook
-   iOS (iPhone and iPad)
-   Nintendo Switch
-   PlayStation 4
-   Windows 10 and above
-   Windows 10 Phone
-   Windows Mixed Reality
-   Xbox One

**Note: Minecraft Marketplace is not currently supported on Xbox 360, Windows Phone 8, PlayStation^TM^ Editions (Legacy version), Wii U, and Apple TV'.**

## Do I need an Xbox Live account to make purchases in Marketplace?

You don't need an Xbox Live account to make purchases in the Marketplace, however a free Xbox Live player profile will allow your Minecoins and your Marketplace content to be available to you on any supported platform (except for Minecraft: Java Edition).

That way, you can use coins and maps you buy across other devices, when you're logged in. If you don't have an account, you can create one by going to ‌<https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/minecraft/sign-up> and creating a new free account.

## How do I know what account to use for Minecraft?

When logged in to Minecraft you will see your Gamertag on the title screen and at the top of the Marketplace.

## How do I purchase Minecoins?

To purchase Minecoins, you must have a payment method set up in your device. The first time you try to purchase something, you'll be asked to add a payment method if you haven't already. Otherwise, when you sign in to make your purchase, you'll be reminded which payment method you have saved.

Your payment method may vary depending on which device you're using to make a purchase. In all cases, by signing in with your Xbox Live account, you can access your Minecoins on any Minecraft device.\*

For example, if you play on both a Windows 10 (and above) device and an iPhone and purchase Minecoins on your iPhone, you'll pay for the coins using your Apple Store account. Later, when you play on your Windows 10 (and above) device, your coins will be available along with any purchases that you made in the Minecraft Marketplace. Then if you decide to purchase more Minecoins on your Windows 10 (and above) device, you'll pay for them using your Microsoft account and your coins and purchases will be available the next time you play on your iPhone. If you later purchase a Fire TV, everything will also appear there when you sign in with your Xbox Live account.

**Note**: **\*If you're a parent with associated child accounts that share your Xbox subscription, make sure that you make purchases with your own account, as child accounts do not provide a payment method for this. If your child has their own Xbox account that you have provided consent for and you want to purchase marketplace content for them, it will need to be purchased through their Xbox/Minecraft account.**

Prepaid cards to redeem for Minecoins may also be available from local retail stores.

## What platforms do Minecoin and Marketplace content codes work on?

Minecoins and Marketplace content are available on the following platforms:

-   Android
-   Amazon Kindle Fire
-   Amazon Fire TV
-   Chromebook
-   iOS (iPhone and iPad)
-   Nintendo Switch
-   PlayStation™ 4
-   Windows 10 and above
-   Windows 10 Mobile
-   Xbox One and Series X\|S

## What can I spend Minecoins on?

You can purchase all in-game content and add-ons using Minecoins, including Skin Packs, Character Packs, and Minecraft Worlds created by the community.

**Note: You can't use Minecoins to purchase Minecraft Realms, but you can purchase a subscription for Realms using the default payment method on your account.**

### Can I save things to purchase later on a Wishlist?

Yes, each offer should have a Wishlist icon ![Image of the Wishlist Icon](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/15216596774541) that allows you to save it to purchase later. This is part of the Wishlist feature and more details could be [found here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360059025451).

### I purchased something and I want to give the creator feedback about it

Players can use the Submit Feedback feature to send a one-way message to Creators. This feedback could be used to improve future content and changes. This button is only available for items you have already purchased from the Minecraft Marketplace and located in the Ratings section of the offer Product Description Page (PDP).

![SubmitFeedback.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/18840301728141)

## I didn't receive the Minecoins that I purchased. What should I do?

If you purchased on your Windows 10 (and above) device:

-   Sign in at [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com/) and check your recent purchases.
-   If you see a completed purchase, restart your device as it may need to be updated.
-   If you have another device running Minecraft, sign in on that device to see if your purchase appears there.
    -   If the purchase appears, there may be a problem on your device. Make sure that you're signed in with the same account used to complete the purchase.
    -   If the purchase doesn't appear, contact [Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us).
    -   Additional Support:
        -   If you purchased from Apple Store (iPhone or iPad), go to the [iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143).
        -   If you purchased from Google Play Store (Android), go to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe).
        -   If you purchased from Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire TV, go to the [Amazon Store](https://www.amazon.com/Mojang-Minecraft-Pocket-Edition/dp/B00992CF6W/).

## Can Minecoins be refunded?

All Minecoin purchases are final. However, if an unauthorized purchase was made by someone else, contact store support for the device that made the purchase.

## Can I convert my Minecoins back to real currency?

No. Once you\'ve purchased Minecoins, they can't be converted back to real currency.

## Can I give Minecoins to someone as a Gift?

Minecoins are available only on the account where they were purchased. They cannot be given from one Xbox Live account to another. However, Minecoin gift cards are available at many retail outlets. You're always welcome to purchase one of these and give it to a friend.

## I tried to use Minecoins to make an in-game purchase, but something went wrong. What should I do?

The most common problem preventing an in-game purchase is that there aren't enough coins. Check the top-right corner of Microsoft Store to make sure you have enough coins to make the purchase. If not, you can click the + icon to purchase more.

If you tried to purchase more coins but you don't see them in your wallet, follow the steps in the previous section titled [I didn\'t receive the coins that I purchased. What do I do?](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408963926541-Minecraft-Marketplace-FAQ#h_01FF8TBWEZRCYSC42KE1TTX3X2)

If you're still having problems, visit the [Minecraft Feedback page](https://feedback.minecraft.net/) for the latest updates and known issues.

## I purchased the wrong Minecraft world by mistake. Can I get a refund?

You'll need to contact store support for the device that you made your purchase on. You may get a refund depending on the circumstances. Follow the steps in the previous section titled [Can Minecoins be refunded?](https://support.xbox.com/games/game-titles/minecraft-marketplace-faq#Refund) for support.

## Why is some content in the Marketplace grayed out? What does it mean when it says that this content is "not compatible with your device due to low memory"?

Some maps and textures require higher performance devices to play effectively. If your device has less than 512MB of internal memory (RAM), you may see some content grayed out (unavailable) in the Microsoft Store. You cannot buy any content that is not compatible with your device, and you cannot download content that is not compatible, even if you already purchased it on a device with higher memory.

## Where are my purchases stored?

If you have an Xbox Live account associated with your game and you were logged in at the time of purchase, your coins and content will be associated with your Xbox Live account. You can access these from any new device, provided you are logged in to the same account. For help with missing purchases, or any Xbox Live account support, please contact [Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/contact-us).

If you do not have an Xbox Live account associated with your game, then your Marketplace purchases will be tied to the device you used for the purchase. Please be aware, uninstalling the game will permanently delete any purchased coins and content purchased this way. For further billing and installation support, contact your device\'s app store.

**Note: To access your purchases from other devices, we recommend that you link them to an Xbox Live account by signing in from the device used for the purchase.**

## I redeemed a content code but can't find my content, where should I look?

Open the in-game Marketplace "Store" and click the button next to your account name to see your inventory. Your content will be listed. Click the icon for the content you want and download the piece of content onto your device.

## I can't redeem my code, what should I do?

See the troubleshooting section of [Redeem a gift card or code to your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/redeem-a-gift-card-or-code-to-your-microsoft-account-d6b2c675-9e31-f312-7ff4-21834ad22fa8).

## I have missing Marketplace items; where can I find them?

When you can't find a Marketplace pack, virtual currency, or game in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition after purchasing from Microsoft Store, Xbox Store, or through a Collection pack, start by making sure you are logged in to the correct account where you want these items to appear. 

In many cases, this happens when parents purchase these items or redeem a gift card on their own Microsoft account and don't realize that they cannot be transferred to a child's account later. 

If you find that you have redeemed a prepaid card or purchased on the wrong account, you must contact [Xbox support. ](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us) 

For other issues, try these steps to troubleshoot.

-   Make sure your game is completely up to date.  
-   Make sure you are signed in with the Microsoft account you used to make the purchases. 
-   Completely close Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. This means:  
    -   On mobile devices close (not minimize) the app running in the background.
    -   On Minecraft for Windows close the game completely by clicking the **X** in the upper right corner.  
    -   On Minecraft for Xbox or PlayStation® 4 access the menu option to close the application. 
    -   Switch on the Nintendo Switch home screen, highlight **Minecraft** and press **X** to close the application.  
-   Make sure you are connected to a reliable internet connection.  
-   Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and make sure you are signed in and you are the only user playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition at this time.  
-   Let the game load up to the home screen and wait for 15 -- 60 seconds (if on Nintendo Switch loading can take up to 120 seconds). This ensures the game has time to completely load. 
-   If this has not solved the issue, please try steps 2-6 again. 

If you are still unable to find your missing Marketplace items, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). 

## I noticed a problem with something I purchased in the Marketplace. How do I let you know?

If you find something broken or otherwise bothersome in an item you purchased in the Marketplace, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).

## How do I become a Minecraft partner and create content for the Marketplace?

If you\'re interested in becoming a partner, and to learn more about the criteria required, visit the [Minecraft Partner Program](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/partner) page for more info.
