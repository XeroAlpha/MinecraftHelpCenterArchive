## What are prepaid Minecraft codes and gift codes?

Minecraft prepaid cards can be used on a Microsoft account (that is not already associated with a copy of the game) and entitle the cardholder to one Minecraft license (in other words, one copy of Minecraft).  

## Where to get Minecraft gift codes?

You can purchase a Minecraft gift card from many retailers that sell digital code gift cards like Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart, and Target.

**Note: Minecraft gift cards are region locked, so if the person redeeming the code lives in another country, it will not work for them.**

## How to redeem a Minecraft gift card

See our [article dedicated to redeeming pre-paid cards](./Redeeming-a-Prepaid-Card-for-Minecraft-Java-Bedrock-Edition-for-PC.md) if you need help using your gift card.

## Minecraft Prepaid Minecoin Cards 

Prepaid gift cards are also available for in-game currency called Minecoins, for use in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition which features a Marketplace.** ** 

**Note: These prepaid cards are for in-game currency only and cannot be used to purchase a copy of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.** 

### Redeem a Minecoin Prepaid Card

1.  Navigate to [this link](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem).
2.  Make sure you're logged in via the top right navigation bar.
3.  Scroll until you see this box:          ![Redeem](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/16784122492685)
4.  Input your code and click '**Submit.**'

Once you have redeemed your Minecoins, they will be linked to your Xbox Live account so that you can access your coins and purchases from all your supported devices that run Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If you need to create an Xbox Live account, visit [www.xbox.com/live](http://www.xbox.com/live) and follow the instructions on the site.  

**Note: Gift codes for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition are redeemed in the Microsoft Store, not on the Minecraft site If you need help with your code for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, visit [Microsoft Support](http://support.microsoft.com/help/10604/microsoft-account-redeem-gift-card-or-code). **

## Prepaid Card and Gift Code Redemption Issues 

**Note: Gift codes can no longer be purchased from our site; today, gift codes can be digitally purchased through Amazon and physical cards can be purchased at various retail outlets.**

## Error Messages When Redeeming Your Card 

### “The card has already been redeemed.”

Contact Microsoft Support or the platform purchased from to see if it was redeemed on your own account. 

### “This PIN code is invalid.”

Contact the store or place that the card was purchased from for further information.

### “General error that code doesn’t work.”

1.  Check for typos to make sure you entered all information accurately and as it appears on your gift card. 
2.  Try again in an hour or two to rule out a temporary server outage. 
3.  Return it to the store that you purchased it from and ask their customer service to activate the card. 

### “We are currently unable to redeem prepaid cards”

1.  Try again in an hour or two to rule out a temporary server outage.
2.  Return it to the store that you purchased it from and ask their customer service to activate the card.
