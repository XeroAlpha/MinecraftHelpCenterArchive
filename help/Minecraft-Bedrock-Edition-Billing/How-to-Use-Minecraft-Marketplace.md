*The Minecraft Marketplace is an in-game store for community-made and official creations that include skin packs, texture packs, and worlds. You can purchase these creations using Minecoins, which can be bought in the game store. Not all community made content requires Minecoins; some packs and worlds can be downloaded for free. Marketplace is only available within Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.*

## Navigating the Marketplace 

Upon entering the Marketplace, you will see all the featured content available, along with different categories for creations. You are able to browse the given categories or select the type of creations you would like to view. To narrow down the creations even further, you can click the search button. Here you can apply filters and use the sorting feature. 

Filters can be used to specify the type of content you would like to browse. There are multiple filters that can be applied to help you determine what you would like to purchase or download. Below are the filters that can be used: 

-   Pack Types - Choose the type of packs you would like to view, whether it be skins, textures, worlds or mashups of all three.  
-   Minecoins - Sort the creations by price range. Here you can also add a filter to view only free content.  
-   Ratings - View creations that have ratings with a certain star level. Creations are rated from 1 to 5 stars.   
-   Creators - If you have a favorite creator, you can add a filter to view only their creations. 
-   Bundles - Multiple packs included into a single bundle.  
-   Realms Plus - Content that is accessible with a Realms Plus subscription.

The sorting feature is another useful tool when searching for creations on the Marketplace. Use this to have the content you view sorted by a certain criteria.

### Using the Wishlist feature

There are many offers available in the Marketplace and sometimes it is hard to remember what you were looking at. Players can add their \"favorite\" items to a wishlist to view later and purchase when ready. This is available as a heart icon in the product description pages for all offer types:\

## Downloading/Deleting content 

After a pack is bought, it is automatically downloaded. After the download is complete you have the option of equipping the skin/texture pack or creating the world you just bought. You can view the content you own by clicking on the "Gamertag's Packs" tab located at the top.  

To delete content, go to Settings, then under the General tab, click on Storage. Here you can click on the individual downloaded content and choose to delete it. You can always re-download purchased content in the Marketplace at any time.

## I purchased something and I want to give the creator feedback about it

Players can use the Submit Feedback feature to send a one-way message to Creators. This feedback could be used to improve future content and changes. This button is only available for items you have already purchased from the Minecraft Marketplace and located in the Ratings section of the offer Product Description Page (PDP).
