## How do I get a DLC code?

DLC codes come included with certain promotional items.

## How does the code work?

The unique code will unlock access to an in-game item! 

## Do I need a Microsoft account?

Yes, we use Xbox Live with your Microsoft Account to allow your DLC item to be available on any supported platform. 

## How do I redeem my DLC code?

1.  Go to [minecraft.net/redeem](https://minecraft.net/redeem) 
2.  Input your 25-digit code in the "Enter Code" box.
3.  Sign in with the Microsoft Account in which you would like to use the item.
4.  Follow the instructions to download the item.
5.  Go to My games and Apps, or My library on the device you play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on, to download the item. 
6.  Enjoy your item in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

## Where do I find my downloadable content in-game? 

Your new item will be found within the Character Creator! Once you are in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, select **Dressing Room**, and then **Edit **your character. 

Need additional guidance? Still having trouble finding your item? See detailed instructions below on how to equip in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. 

[Please review our terms and conditions here](https://account.mojang.com/terms)   

## How do I equip my in-game DLC item?

### To equip your item in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 

1.  Launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
2.  Sign in with the Microsoft Account used to redeem the code 
3.  Open the **Profile** menu 
4.  Choose the character you would like to equip the item on and select **Edit Character**
5.  From the **Style** menu, find the appropriate category of item you redeemed (outerwear, gloves, etc.) and equip your item! 

## Do I need a special version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition to redeem a DLC code?

You will need Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, found on Android, Apple iOS, Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 4 or 5, Chromebook, Windows, or Xbox One and X\|S to access your redeemed content. You need to redeem the code to the specific Microsoft Account you wish the content to be tied to. Then you will need to sign into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with that account on any device that has the game available.

You will need to ensure the game is listed as "Minecraft" for this content to work properly. For example, things that are not listed as "Minecraft" but instead listed as *"Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition", "Minecraft: PlayStation🄬4 Edition", "Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition", "Minecraft: Xbox One Edition", "Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition", "Minecraft: Wii U Edition"* will not sync with in-game items.  

## How to enable a child's account to redeem DLC codes:

Microsoft Child Accounts for children under 9 years of age are not allowed to enter codes to receive items or DLC by design as a safety feature. To enable your child's account so you can temporarily redeem a code for the DLC on the account, please follow these steps: 

-   On your phone, open the Xbox Family Settings app 
-   Click on your Child's account 
-   Click on Content Restrictions 
-   Change the Restriction to allow material up to Age 10 
    -   This will enable you to redeem 5x5 codes on your child's account 
-   Still in the Xbox Family Settings app, click on Ask to Buy to disable it 
    -   If a child account has Ask to Buy on, they cannot redeem some 5x5 codes 
-   On your computer, go to xbox.com and log in via your child's account 
-   Go to xbox.com/redeemcode 
-   Enter the 5x5 code as written and click on redeem. Follow all prompts to fully redeem the code. 

You have now redeemed the code on your child's account. 

**IMPORTANT: In order to reset your child's account settings to prevent any redemptions of codes in the future, please follow the following steps: **

-   On your phone, open the Xbox Family Settings app 
-   Click on your Child's account 
-   Click on **Content Restrictions** 
-   Change the Restriction to allow material up to Age 9 
    -   Accounts of Age 9 and below cannot redeem 5x5 codes 
-   Still in the Xbox Family Settings app, click on **Require Approval for Every Purchase** to enable it 
    -   If a child account has **Require Approval for Every Purchase** off, they cannot redeem some 5x5 codes 

If you wish to do this process through the [Microsoft Account](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/family-online-safety/online-safety/manage-online-safety-and-privacy-settings-xbox-one) manage webpage you can do so. However, in our experience, this process is done faster using the app.
