**Note: You can only play Minecraft: Java Edition on a non-Windows device. While you will own both Minecraft: Java Edition *and* Minecraft: Bedrock Edition after buying the game, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition will only be available on a Windows device.**

## I want to buy Minecraft from the Microsoft Store 

1.  Start by opening the Microsoft Store and search for Minecraft. ‘Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition’ will appear in the search results.
2.  Click ‘Buy’ and one of two things will happen. 
    1.  **If you’re not signed in, you will be prompted to sign into the MS Store using your MSA.   **
    2.  **If you are signed in, you must enter or select a payment method for purchasing the game.**
3.  Because you’re on a non-Win10 device, MS Store doesn’t have the Launcher you need to install. 
4.  Instead, you’ll see a page that channels you to Minecraft.com/download to get the Launcher version you need. 
5.  From Minecraft.net, download the Launcher for your specific operating system.
6.  Once downloaded, you can open the Launcher and log-in with the MSA you used to buy the game from the Store. 
7.  Within the launcher, you can see that you now own Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. However, you cannot play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition as you aren’t on a Windows 10/11 device.

4.  You can click ‘Buy Now’ on either version of the game and will be taken to an in-launcher buy page.

6.  From Minecraft.net, you must download the Launcher for your specific operating system.
