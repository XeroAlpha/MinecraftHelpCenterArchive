**Note: Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition are now sold as one bundle under the Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC label, meaning some information in this article is now outdated. For information on buying Minecraft, please [refer to this article](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Technical/Minecraft-Java-Bedrock-Edition-for-PC-FAQ.md).**

## Prepaid Minecraft Cards 

Minecraft prepaid cards can be used on a Microsoft account (that is not already associated with a copy of the game) and entitle the cardholder to one Minecraft license (in other words, one copy of Minecraft).    
   
If you have purchased a Minecraft: Java Edition prepaid card at a retail store, you can redeem your code by [visiting minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem#find-store) and clicking **REDEEM JAVA EDITION**. You will be prompted to log in or create a Microsoft account. Once this is complete you can redeem your code and finish setting up your Minecraft profile.

## Where can I buy a gift code? 

Gift codes can be purchased through Amazon. Mojang Studios no longer sells them directly. However, the Minecraft website currently links users only to the US version of Amazon. 

So how do you get a Minecraft gift code? Here are a few alternative links for other countries (please note that some Amazon pages include other countries as well):

## Where is my gift code? 

When you purchase a gift code, you can either have it sent to your email address or to a friend’s email address. After it's been purchased, you can view the code on your profile by [logging in to the Mojang account](http://account.mojang.com/) where the code was purchased.  

Once the code has been redeemed, the Java profile name of the person who redeemed it will appear under the header **Redeemed By.**

You should receive your gift code shortly after purchasing it, as well as a purchase confirmation email. If this didn't happen, see if any of the following scenarios applies. 

## Cannot Find Gift Code Email 

If you cannot locate your gift code in your email inbox or account profile, check your junk or spam email folders. 

## Bank Transfers and Other Payment Types 

Some slower payment types, such as bank transfers, can take 3-5 business days to complete. If you paid this way, make sure that the payment went through by checking your email for the confirmation.

## Failed Transaction  

There is occasionally an issue where a failed transaction sends a customer to the payment confirmation screen. If, after a few hours, you have only received a [32-character order number](../General-Billing/What-is-a-Transaction-ID.md) and not a [transaction ID](../General-Billing/What-is-a-Transaction-ID.md), it is unlikely that the transaction was successful. Please double-check your bank account to confirm that you were charged. 

## Request to Authorize Your Payment  

If you've received a call from your credit card company asking if you would like to authorize an international transaction (Mojang Studios is in Sweden), they may have derailed the payment process, even if they eventually approve the transaction. Confirm that your credit card was charged. If it was not, you can wait for a charge to process or try your purchase again. If you were charged, you must obtain the [transaction ID](../General-Billing/What-is-a-Transaction-ID.md) and contact us, as it is possible that the hold interrupted the payment process and we were not electronically notified of the purchase. 

**Note: If you cannot locate your gift code in your email inbox or account profile, check your junk or spam email folders. If you don’t find it, contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). Note that we must have the [transaction ID](../General-Billing/What-is-a-Transaction-ID.md) to view your purchase.  **

## I accidentally purchased a Minecraft: Java Edition gift code.

If you have accidentally purchased a Minecraft gift code instead of purchasing Minecraft, you can still get the game without having to be refunded. Simply go to our Redeem Minecraft: Java Edition site and redeem your code. 

Please be sure that you are redeeming a code that you purchased from an [authorized retailer](#where-can-i-buy-agift-code). Codes from other sites may not work or may cease to work after a time due to being refunded.

## Prepaid Card and Gift Code Redemption Issues 

Minecraft prepaid gift cards are now available through select “brick and mortar” retailers. [More information about purchasing a prepaid card](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem#find-store).  

**Note:** Gift codes can no longer be purchased from our site; today, all gift codes are purchased through Amazon. 

### Error Messages When Redeeming Your Card

#### “The card has already been redeemed.”

Visit [account.mojang.com/me](https://account.mojang.com/me) to see if it was redeemed on your own account. 

#### “This PIN code is invalid.”

Contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support) with: 

1.  an image of your gift card's PIN  
2.  the receipt from the card's purchase 

#### “Requiring that you open or save a file.”

Visit [www.enable-javascript.com](http://www.enable-javascript.com/) to ensure that you have Javascript enabled. 

#### “General error that code doesn’t work.”

1.  Check for typos to make sure you entered all information accurately and as it appears on your gift card. 
2.  Try again in an hour or two to rule out a temporary server outage. 
3.  Return it to the store that you purchased it from and ask their customer service to activate the card. 

####  “We are currently unable to redeem prepaid cards” 

1.  Try again in an hour or two to rule out a temporary server outage.
2.  Return it to the store that you purchased it from and ask their customer service to activate the card.
