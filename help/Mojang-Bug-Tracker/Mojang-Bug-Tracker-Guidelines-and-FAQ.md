## Guidelines

The [Mojang Bug Tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa) (also known by its nickname Mojira) is the place where all bugs in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and other games created by Mojang Studios are reported, documented, and tracked. Read the full guidelines carefully before you create a bug report or participate on the bug tracker.

If you need additional help with reporting a bug or have questions about the bug tracker, feel free to ask other players in the community by visiting our official Minecraft social channels, or visit one of the [community links](#i-have-more-questions-where-can-i-ask-them).

### What Can Be Reported on the Bug Tracker and What Cannot?

We will only accept your bug report if it is about a bug. A bug is something in the game not behaving the way it should, due to a problem in the game's code. As such, it should be reproducible and not be caused by circumstances outside of the game. Keeping the bug tracker focused on true bugs helps to get them addressed faster by Mojang Studios.

The following types of issues are not bugs and are not allowed on the bug tracker:

- **Minecraft account or payment issues**
  - If you have trouble accessing your Minecraft account, or if you have payment or purchase issues (including Realms and Marketplace), contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). We cannot help with this on the bug tracker.
- **Suggestions and feature requests**
  - To suggest a new feature for Minecraft, or to post a suggestion, do so on the official [Minecraft feedback site](https://feedback.minecraft.net/) or visit one of the [community links](#i-have-more-questions-where-can-i-ask-them).
- **Parity issues introduced prior to the Buzzy Bees update**
  - To report a parity issue (a difference between the different editions of the game), review the official [parity issue guidelines](../../feedback/Feedback-Website/Parity-Requests-and-You-A-Guide.md) before doing so. If your report does not fulfill all of the criteria, it belongs on the official [Minecraft feedback site](https://feedback.minecraft.net/).
- **Translation issues for Minecraft: Java Edition and the Minecraft Launcher**
  - These translation issues need to be raised in the [Minecraft](https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft) or [Minecraft Launcher](https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft-launcher) Crowdin projects, since the translation of the game is done there by members of the Minecraft community.  
    Issues with the original “English (US)” language are allowed on the bug tracker since they are not included in the community translation process.
- **General connection issues (Realms, Marketplace) and authentication issues**
  - These issues are typically outside the control of the game’s code and are usually due to server maintenance, downtime, or local network configuration. If the issues persist, consider asking the community (see [FAQs](#faqs)).

### How to Use the Bug Tracker’s Search Efficiently

Before reporting a bug, always search for an existing report. Here are a few tips on searching for existing bug reports:

- Use as few keywords as possible. The search engine will only find bug reports containing all the words in your query. For example, search for “squid suffocate” instead of “Squid will frequently suffocate for no reason when swimming around in a river”.
- Verify all words spelled correctly.
- Try multiple separate searches using synonyms. For example, “workstation”, “job site”, and “profession block”.
- Restrict your search to the project you want to report the bug to. A list of all current projects with their description is included in the [General Bug Guidelines](#h_01FF66ASEAVED34B6NDVWZMCYE) section.
- Sort your search results by date created, with the newest bug reports on top. Review them to see if they describe your issue.
- If there are too many bug reports to review easily, you can change the sort criteria (e.g., sort by votes), further refine your search query, or exclude already resolved bug reports. Keep in mind though, that the issue you’re searching for may have already been addressed in a resolved report.

If you find that your issue has already been reported, look at the [Resolution](#h_01FFNM44167TBFS73NJ9TZ06M3) of the report to determine what steps to take next.

## Resolution Statuses

- **Unresolved** – The bug has not been fixed yet. In this case, vote for the bug report. This helps us gauge how many players are affected by the bug. You can also add more information to the bug report if you think anything is missing.
- **Awaiting Response** – View the “Comments” section to see what is missing from the bug report. You can provide this missing information in a comment to reopen the report.
- **Duplicate** – Follow the link to its parent report in the “Issue Links” section. That parent report is where your issue is tracked.
- **Fixed** – Find the “Fix version”. This is the version in which the bug was fixed by Mojang Studios. If you’re using a newer version than the one specified, create a new bug report if you can’t find another, newer report about your issue. If the fix version is a “Future version”, the bug will be fixed in a version that has not yet been released to the public.
- **Other Resolutions** – Read the comments carefully, if there are any, to understand why it has been resolved.

## Contributing Guidelines

If you found an existing bug report about your issue, you can add more information by commenting or attaching a file (e.g., a screenshot or video). Follow the following guidelines when contributing to the bug tracker in any way:

### General

**IMPORTANT:** The bug tracker is a public place. **DO NOT** share your password, email address, transaction ID, or other personal information under any circumstances.

- Do not impersonate others, for example via your username or display name.

### Comments

- Do not leave a comment on a bug report if you don't have anything new to add.
- Do not add comments like “me too” or similar that simply state that you experienced the bug without any further information.
- Keep all comments related to information about the bug itself. Complaints and criticism of Mojang Studios, its employees, or anyone else are not acceptable on the bug tracker.
- Any kind of profanity and NSFW content is not allowed on the bug tracker.
- If you want to initiate a discussion about a bug or need to report someone, take the discussion outside of the bug tracker (see [FAQs](#faqs)), do not comment directly on the bug tracker.
- Do not imitate or use the preformatted responses used by helpers or moderators.  
  Attachments
- Do not attach new screenshots unless they show something significantly different than the ones that are already part of the bug report.
- When attaching a file to an existing bug report, post a supporting comment for context.
- When embedding an image in a comment (or in the description of a bug report), make sure that the image size is not too large.

To embed an image, use the following markup in text editing mode:

    !picture_name.png|thumbnail!

  
**IMPORTANT:** Remove any personal information (email address, gamer tag, realm links, etc.) from your attachments before posting them.

## General Bug Report Guidelines

When creating a bug report, keep the following guidelines in mind:

**IMPORTANT:** If your bug report contains sensitive information which you don’t want to be publicly visible, set the “Security Level” of the report to “Private” and explicitly mention that you don’t want it to be public.

- In case you have discovered an exploitive or security issue, set the bug report’s “Security Level” to “Private” so that only you, Mojang Studios employees, and bug tracker moderators are able to view your bug report.
- Before creating a bug report, spend time checking whether someone else has already reported it. See the tips above on using the search effectively.
- We only accept bug reports in English; do not create bug reports in other languages.
- Only put one issue into each bug report. We will not accept your bug report if you include multiple bugs.
- If you are using any mods or third-party tools at all, see if the issue persists in a completely unmodified Minecraft environment before reporting it. If it doesn't, report the bug to the mod creator, not Mojang Studios.
- This includes third-party server software, such as Spigot or Paper.
- OptiFine is considered a mod in all circumstances.
- Worlds that have been opened with a third-party tool are not supported.
- If you have an issue on a large multiplayer server (like Hypixel or The Hive), contact the server staff first before creating a bug report. These kinds of servers often run modified server software that is not supported by Mojang Studios.
- Only report a bug if you are sure that it is still active in the latest version of the game. We do not accept bug reports for any versions except for the latest release and the latest development version
- Report the issue to the correct project:
  - **MC**: [Minecraft: Java Edition](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC) – Windows, Mac, and Linux
  - **MCPE**: [Minecraft (Bedrock codebase)](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE) – Amazon Fire TV, Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation®, Windows 10 and above (from the Microsoft store), and Xbox.
  - **MCD**: T*he Minecraft Dungeons Bug Tracker is no longer accepting new bugs. For more information, check out our [latest announcement](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/dungeons--25-million-players) about Minecraft Dungeons.*
  - **MCLG**: *The Minecraft Legends bug tracker is no longer active for new bug reports and comments.*
  - **MCL**: [Minecraft Launcher](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCL) – Launcher for Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft Dungeons
  - **REALMS**: [Minecraft Realms](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/REALMS) – Issues with Realms management or that only occur on a Realm
  - **BDS**: [Bedrock Dedicated Server](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS) – Issues that only occur on Bedrock Dedicated Servers
  - **WEB**: [Mojang Web Services](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/WEB) – Issues with one of Mojang Studios’ websites
- The “Labels” field is for use by helpers or moderators to help organize bug reports. Only use existing labels and don’t create new labels. For more information on how labels work, see our [FAQ](#faqs).
- After creating a bug report, watch for related emails or regularly check the bug report for updates or potential further inquiries.
- Keep the project-specific guidelines in mind as well.

## How to Write Helpful Bug Reports

To help ensure that your bug report is effective, it is highly recommended that you follow these guidelines:

- Write a concise summary that clearly states the problem. Avoid generic statements like “Help!”, “It doesn't work”, “It’s broken”, or “There’s a bug”, and instead use a short phrase to accurately summarize your issue. You may find it helpful to think about what you would search on to find the issue.
- Include precise steps to reproduce the issue. Write down what exactly you did that caused the issue. If you are not sure, try to recreate the bug in a test world. Use a numbered list for the steps, so it is easy for someone else to follow.
- After listing the steps, clearly state what happens, and what you believe should happen.
- Include the exact text of any messages (e.g., error messages) that appeared at the time of your issue.
- Attach screenshots to the report to showcase the issue more clearly. If possible, you can attach a short video as well. In some cases, it might also make sense to provide a world save (as ZIP archive).
- If the attachment file size is too large, upload it somewhere else and link to it in the description of the bug report or attach a smaller compressed file.
- If your bug is linked to a specific world, such as a world generation, portal transport, biome, or structure issue, be sure to include the world seed and all relevant coordinates.
- Do not use excessive formatting (bold, all caps, large text, multiple blank lines, etc.).
- If you are aware of any situation in which the behavior you are reporting is used as a feature, mention it in the description of your bug report. This way the developers can decide if they want to keep the behavior or add a respective replacement for it.
- Take your time. Read over your bug report to make sure you didn’t leave out anything and that everything is clearly explained.

## Project-specific Guidelines

### Minecraft: Java Edition

- To report a crash, attach the crash report to the bug report. You can find crash reports in the “crash-reports” subfolder of the [.minecraft](../Backup-Restore/Locating-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Files-for-Backup-or-Transfer.md) data folder. If there is no related crash report, attach the launcher log.
- If you create a bug report about a server-side performance issue, include the debug profile and report to the bug report. You can create them by using the /debug command.
- If you create a bug report about a client-side performance issue, provide detailed information about your system specifications and the circumstances in which the performance issue occurs. Bug reports about general performance issues (for example “Minecraft always has low FPS”) are usually not accepted.

### Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

- Always specify exactly what device (platform) you are using.
- Crash logs are automatically collected and reported to Mojang Studios. Only report a crash if you can provide a list of steps to reproduce the crash.

### Minecraft Realms

- Make sure the Affected Version and Platform match.
- Specify the device you are using in the Environment field.
- Specify whether you are the realm owner.
- Search the corresponding main project (MC or MCPE) for existing bug reports also.
- If you are unable to connect to realms that were previously working, check the [Official Mojang Status](https://twitter.com/MojangStatus) to see if there are any scheduled maintenance or other connection issues.

### Example Template

Here’s an example of how you could format a new bug report; feel free to copy and paste this:

## FAQs

### What are “Labels” and how should I use them?

Bug reports are labeled with certain keywords to group them together to make them easier to find. A label can be any word or phrase if it doesn’t contain a space. There are no limits to how many labels a bug report can have.

Every user can create a new label by simply adding it to their own bug report, however, this is discouraged, and you should only add already existing labels to your bug report. In most cases there is no need to add labels to your own report.

The “Labels” field is for use by helpers or moderators to help organize bug reports. Don’t create new labels and only use presently existing labels. There are certain rules which labels should follow:

- If something has an ID in the game (like blocks, entities, and items), use that ID without the “minecraft:” prefix as the label (e.g., “glowstone_dust” or “zombie_villager”)
- Prefix the label with a slash (“/”) for commands only (e.g., “/gamerule”)
- Use the “ing” suffix for verbs (e.g., “breeding” or “fishing”)
- Don't use plurals unless it’s the actual name of the element (e.g., “statistics”)
- For everything else, connect words with a dash (e.g., “stronghold-portal”)

### Why can’t I log in to the Mojang bug tracker?

This is most likely to be a result of one of the following scenarios:

- **You have not created a JIRA account**  
  You will need to create a separate JIRA account to use the Mojang bug tracker – you cannot log in with your Microsoft or Mojang account.
- **Your username may have changed**  
  You need to log in with your current JIRA username, not your email address. Please make sure usernames do not contain any personal or contact information. If you have forgotten your login details or think they have been changed by an administrator, you may wish to use the “Can’t access your account?” link on the login page for help accessing your account.
- **Your account may have been restricted**  
  User accounts may be restricted from accessing the bug tracker if they do not adhere to the [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards), or if users do not follow the bug tracker guidelines and direction from Mojang staff, moderators, and helpers.

### What account do I need to log in with to use the bug tracker?

The bug tracker uses a separate account system than Minecraft. You need to create a separate account that is used only for the bug tracker. You can do that here: [Sign up for a bug tracker account](https://bugs.mojang.com/).

### Why do I need to specify my “Full name” when I sign up for an account?

You do not need to sign up with your real name. The Full name field can be your “Display name”. You can use anything you want, as long as you don’t use inappropriate language or try to impersonate a moderator, helper, or someone else.

### Now that I have reported my bug, what should I do?

Thank you! You should watch for related emails or regularly check the bug report for updates or potential further inquiries. If there are any questions by a helper or moderator in a comment, please answer them.  
Also, it’s best to check regularly whether the bug is still in the game and update the bug report accordingly. It is not necessary to check every single version that is released, though.

### What happens to my bug report after it is submitted?

A helper or moderator will review the report to make sure it follows the bug tracker guidelines. The majority of new bug reports are duplicates of issues that have already been reported, while others do not contain enough information to identify or reproduce the issue.

If the report does not follow the guidelines, it will be marked as resolved. If the report is accepted, the helper or moderator may attempt to reproduce the bug using the information provided and if they are able to do so, it will be marked as confirmed. Then, Mojang Studios will look at the bug report and decide when and how they want to fix it.

### How long will it take for my bug to be fixed?

This depends on how severe the issue is, how large the risk of fixing it is, and how much effort is involved in fixing it. In some cases, Mojang may decide that a bug will not be fixed. These bug reports are resolved as “Won’t Fix”.

There is no general rule for how long it will take for your bug to get fixed. Some issues get fixed within a couple of days others may take a long time.

On some projects, bug reports are assigned to certain developers, which can be seen in the **Assignee** field. This means that the developer is working on the issue, but it does not necessarily imply that the bug will be fixed soon.

For Minecraft: Java Edition, you might also see that a “Mojang Priority” is assigned to the bug report, which indicates how important the bug is to Mojang Studios (more details below).

### Why was my bug report resolved, but the problem still happens?

There are multiple ways in which a bug report can be resolved. On each bug report, you can find its resolution at the top of the page below the status. You can find the meanings of the different resolutions below.

Only the resolution **Fixed** implies that the bug has been fixed by the developers. If your bug report has a different resolution, read its comments for an explanation for how and why it has been resolved.

### Do you have some more tips on how to use the search function?

Some advanced search tips to try:

- Search terms are reduced to word stems, so for instance if you search for “breeding”, JIRA will also return bug reports which only contain “breed”. To avoid that, surround a word or phrase in double-quotes.
- You can use wildcards such as “enderm?n” (which will catch both “enderman” and “endermen”) or “connect\*” (which will match everything starting with “connect”, so “connection”, “connectivity”, etc).
- When using the **Quick Search** bar in the top right, you can use some shortcuts for searching.
- If the search query contains a project key (e.g., “mcpe”), it only returns bug reports for that project.
- You can also filter by resolutions (e.g., “fixed”) or reporter (e.g., “r:me” returns bug reports reported by you).
- See more information in the [JIRA documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver088/quick-searching-1004938376.html)**.**
- The “Advanced” search looks complicated, but it is very handy if you invest a little time understanding it. Read more about how it works in the [JIRA documentation](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/jcore-docs-088/Advanced+searching)**.**

### I believe my bug report was resolved incorrectly! Where can I appeal?

You can leave a comment on the resolved bug report. For extra visibility, you can also ask other players and moderators. (See [Community Links](#i-have-more-questions-where-can-i-ask-them).)

### I want to discuss this issue; can I comment on it?

If you have any suggestions or extra information to improve a bug report, we encourage commenting on it. The bug tracker is for gathering and organizing information that is helpful to the developers in replicating and fixing bugs.

However, if you want to discuss an issue, for instance, whether you think it should count as a valid bug, or whether it should be fixed or not, take the discussion outside of the bug tracker. (See [Community Links](#i-have-more-questions-where-can-i-ask-them).)

### What Does Voting for an Issue do?

By voting for an issue, you show that you are affected by the issue described by the bug report. This way we can estimate roughly how many players in total are affected. Mojang Studios uses this metric among others to decide how urgent a bug is to fix. However, this is not the only relevant criteria.

### What does “Confirmation Status” mean?

“Confirmation Status” is used to document if the bug has been reproduced by someone else. There are four different confirmation statuses:

- **Unconfirmed** – No one except the reporter has experienced the issue so far.
- **Plausible** – A helper or moderator has reviewed the bug report but has not yet reproduced the issue.
- **Community Consensus** – Someone other than the reporter has experienced the issue.
- **Confirmed** – A helper or moderator has successfully reproduced the issue. Usually, this also requires that a list of steps to replicate the bug is included in the description and that a screenshot or video showcasing the issue is attached.

### My attachment’s file size is too large, what should I do?

You can always upload your attachment somewhere else and simply link to it in your comment or your bug report description.

For videos, often reducing the resolution of your video makes a significant difference in terms of the video’s file size. Also, some file formats produce smaller file sizes than others, for instance, .mp4 files are almost always smaller than .avi files. For most video formats, you can reduce the bitrate as well for extra savings (for reference, YouTube videos at 1080p usually use 10000).

### What do the different link types mean?

- **duplicates** – It is a duplicate of the linked bug report.
- **is duplicated by** – The linked bug report is a duplicate of this bug report.
- **relates to** – This and the linked bug report are related in some way, e.g., they are very similar to each other or are about the same mechanic or feature of the game.
- **clones** – This about the same bug as the linked bug report, which has been resolved as fixed before.
- **is cloned by** – The linked bug report is a newer report about the same bug.
- **blocks** – The bug in the linked bug report cannot be tested or fixed before this bug report is resolved.
- **is blocked by** – The linked bug report needs to be resolved before this bug report can be tested or resolved.
- **discovered while testing** – This bug was discovered while testing the linked bug report.
- **testing discovered** – While testing this bug, the bug in the linked bug report was discovered.

### What does “Mojang Priority” mean?

“Mojang Priority” is set by Mojang Studios on Minecraft: Java Edition bug reports to document how important it is to them to fix the bug. This also considers how much effort is involved in fixing the bug.

If a bug report has “Mojang Priority” set, it is considered a valid bug by Mojang Studios.

### What is the “CHK” field used for?

In the past, CHK was set whenever a moderator checked a bug report. Today it is set to the date and time when the confirmation status of the bug report was initially changed by a helper or moderator. It is not particularly significant.

### I found more than one unresolved bug report that seems to describe the same issue. Which one is the main report?

If one of the bug reports already has duplicates linked to it (i.e., if there are bug reports listed in the [is duplicated by](#what-do-the-different-link-types-mean) issue links section), that is the one that has been designated as the main report for the issue. Otherwise, the oldest (first reported) bug report is usually preferred unless a later one has more useful detail or has already been confirmed. Remember to only comment if you have new information to add, but still vote for the bug report.

Finally, thank you for taking the time to search, as this helps the moderators to have more time to replicate and confirm bug reports instead of resolving them as duplicates.

### What else can I do to help?

You can look at other people’s bug reports, test them, or try to help improve their bug reports by leaving comments with extra information about the bug at hand. Often the most useful information is a list of steps to reproduce the bug, and a screenshot or clear video if there isn’t one already.

In case a bug report has not been updated by the reporter for a long time, you may also request ownership so you can take over updating the report.

You can also get in touch with other players who frequent the bug tracker through our [Community Links](#i-have-more-questions-where-can-i-ask-them), where you can communicate with others who want to help.

### Who are the helpers and moderators, what do they do, and how did they become helpers/moderators?

Helpers and moderators are volunteers. They are not Mojang Studio employees and are normal players of the game, just like you. However, they have helped with organizing bug reports on the bug tracker for a long time, and as such have been chosen by Mojang Studios and the existing moderators.

Helpers can edit any bug report as if it was their own, in order to add additional information about the bug or to clarify wording or an unclear description. They can also update the [Confirmation Status](#what-does-confirmation-status-mean).  
Moderators can also resolve, link, move, and delete bug reports. They can also remove comments and see private bug reports.

### What does “Mojira” mean?

“Mojira” is the nickname of the Mojang bug tracker. The software that the bug tracker uses is called “JIRA” and is made by Atlassian. “Mojira” is a portmanteau of “Mojang” and “JIRA”.

### I have more questions, where can I ask them?

If you still have a question that’s left unanswered, try asking other players directly on our official Minecraft social channels. There are other sites that you might find useful, too, but remember these are external links and are not owned or moderated by the Minecraft team:
