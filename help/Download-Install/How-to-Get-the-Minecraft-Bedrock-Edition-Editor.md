The Minecraft Editor is an in-engine, multiblock experience that exists to improve the workflows of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition creators and make it possible for creators of all skillsets to easily craft high-quality experiences. The Editor is in early development for Windows PC and there is a lot of work ahead of us. We are sharing early because we want your help creating the experience.

**Note: Editor is not a new game mode. It is a tool to assist creators in their world-building workflows.**

### How do I install Minecraft Editor?

Read our [documentation in the Learning Portal](https://aka.ms/LearnEditor) or the quick start README in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor). Currently, the Editor is not available in the Minecraft Launcher, so you will need to access it via a desktop shortcut that will launch in Minecraft Preview.

Please give feedback and report bugs in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor). You can also find our manuals and tutorials in [Microsoft Learn](https://aka.ms/LearnEditor).
