Minecraft is sold and licensed separately on each platform. Your Minecraft version can only be played on the platforms specified in the system requirements and transferring licenses across different platforms is not possible. Hereâ€™s more information about supported platforms and transferring files between devices:

- **Supported Platforms:** For more information on different editions of Minecraft and what version your device supports, check out our article on [Different Minecraft Editions](../Get-Minecraft/Different-Minecraft-Editions.md).
- **Reinstalling Minecraft:** If you are playing on a PC, Mac, or Linux, view our article on How to [Download and Install the Minecraft Launcher](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/How-to-Download-and-Install-the-Minecraft-Launcher.md).
- **Transferring Minecraft to a New Device:** If you bought a new device and need to copy saved files, see [How to Transfer Your World to Another Device in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](../Backup-Restore/How-to-Transfer-Your-World-to-Another-Device-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) to identify file storage locations for worlds and other files.
