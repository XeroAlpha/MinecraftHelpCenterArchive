Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshots allow you to try out in-development versions of Minecraft before they are fully released. They contain various features that are in the testing phase, though they may not contain everything planned for the next update.

It is important to remember that Minecraft Snapshot releases are not fully finished, and you will probably notice bugs or glitches when playing these versions. With that in mind, you can let us know about issues you find in [our bug tracker](https://minecraft.net/en-us/bugs/pc/).

To leave other feedback that is not related to bugs, please visit the [Minecraft Feedback page](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us).
