Minecraft Beta and Minecraft Preview allow you to play an in-development version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and test features before they’re fully released on Android and iOS devices. [Learn About Minecraft Beta and Preview](./Learn-About-Minecraft-Beta-and-Preview.md).

## How to join Minecraft Beta on Android

Minecraft Beta on Android will replace your normal Minecraft client, so we highly recommend you follow instructions in our [Backup & Restore](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125) section to save your worlds before installing. To play Minecraft Beta on Android, you will need to opt in to the Beta on Google Play first**.**

1.  Open the Google Play Store app on your device.
2.  Search for Minecraft and open the app listing.
3.  Go to the bottom of the app description.
4.  Select **Join Beta** and select **Join** to confirm your choice.

You can leave the Minecraft Beta by repeating these steps and selecting **Leave** instead.

## How to sign up for Minecraft Preview on iOS

Minecraft Preview on iOS is managed through TestFlight and has limited capacity. See the Apple TestFlight page to [Join the Minecraft Preview beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/qC1ZnReJ).

If you see a message that the beta is full, check back on or around the first of the month for spots to open.
