When you get a new device, you can install and play Minecraft if you previously bought Minecraft for that platform and use the same account to sign in. For example, if you get a new Windows PC, simply download and install Minecraft and then sign in using the Microsoft account that owns Minecraft.

As part of your new device set up, you can also continue playing the same world by moving your world files.

Here’s a checklist to set up your new device for Minecraft:

- **Verify you saved your credentials**: Purchases made to your Microsoft or platform-specific account can be lost if you don’t remember your sign-in information or can’t recover it. Make sure you’ve saved your credentials from your old device and can sign in on your new device.
- **Download Minecraft and sign in**: If you play Minecraft on a computer, go to [Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC Deluxe Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc?tabs=%7B%22details%22%3A0%7D) and select the link for your platform. If you play Minecraft on a console or mobile device, download and install Minecraft from the store you bought it from originally.
- **Transfer your Minecraft worlds**: Depending on your device and platform, you can transfer files through the cloud, with physical storage, or by using Minecraft Realms. Go to our [Backup & Restore Help section](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/27166561402125) for guides on how to transfer, restore, and import your world files.
