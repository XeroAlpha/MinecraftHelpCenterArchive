If you’d like to try Minecraft: Java Edition and haven’t played before, you can play the Demo for free. This is also a great way to see if your device hardware can run Minecraft. Visit [Start a Free Trial](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/free-trial) and scroll down to Minecraft: Java Edition.

Here’s what you can expect from the Minecraft: Java Edition Demo:

- **You need a Microsoft account**: The Demo is available after you log in to the launcher if you do not own Minecraft.
- **You can play the Demo for five in-game days**: This is about 100 minutes in real-time.
- **You can play in single-player, Survival mode**: Commands are disabled and multiplayer servers cannot be joined.
- **You can play over LAN**: Only one demo account is allowed in the LAN game.

If you enjoy the demo, you can purchase [Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC Deluxe Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc?tabs=%7B%22details%22%3A0%7D).
