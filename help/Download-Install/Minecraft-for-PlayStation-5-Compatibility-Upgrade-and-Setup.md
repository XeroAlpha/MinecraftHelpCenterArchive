Minecraft is now natively playable on PlayStation® 5 (PS5). While you can always download and play the PlayStation 4 (PS4) version via backwards compatibility, the PS5 version gives you access to 4K visuals and 60 frames per second. Here are some things you need to know about getting set up with this new version of the game.

## Upgrading to Minecraft for PS5 from the PS4 version via download

If you own the PS4 license for Minecraft on your PlayStation Network (PSN) account and are playing on PS5, you can find and download the PS5 version as long as you have access to an internet connection. Here is how to find it:

1.  Start your PlayStation 5 and sign in to the PSN account that owns a license to Minecraft.
2.  Select **Game Library**.
3.  Go to the **Your Collection** tab.
4.  Find and select **Minecraft**.
5.  Select the PS5 version to go to the store page.
6.  Select **Download**.

## Upgrading to Minecraft for PS5 from a PS4 version disc

1.  Sign in to your existing PSN account on your PS5 console or create an account.
2.  Insert the eligible Minecraft for PS4 game disc.
3.  Go to the game hub for Minecraft for PS4.
4.  Select the **upgrade offer** on the game hub and review the upgrade offer.
5.  Select **Download** to download content.
6.  After the download is complete, you can play the PS5 digital game by inserting the PS4 game disc. You will need to keep the disc inserted each time to play the game.

## Migrating Minecraft worlds from PS4 to PS5

Migrating your worlds from the PS4 version of Minecraft into PS5 is very simple. You can find instructions for making a cloud save of your Minecraft for PlayStation worlds here:

- [How to Back Up Your Minecraft Save to the Cloud on PlayStation](../Backup-Restore/How-to-Back-Up-Your-Minecraft-Save-to-the-Cloud-on-PlayStation.md)

After you save your Minecraft worlds to the cloud, follow these instructions to convert your PS4 worlds to the PS5 version:

**Note:** If you want to delete any old worlds from your PS4 saves, you will need to access them via the PS4 version of Minecraft and delete them there.

1.  Start the Minecraft PS5 version.
2.  Select **Play**.
3.  Select the **Worlds** tab.
4.  Select **Old Worlds**.
5.  Find the world you want to use on PS5 and select the **Download World** icon.
6.  Wait for the world to download.

**Note**: When downloading or transferring Minecraft worlds to your PS5 for the first time, you may encounter longer-than-expected wait times. We recommend waiting for the requested operation to complete and not cancelling operations unless prompted. If you do cancel when prompted, you can begin the operation again at anytime, but it may not reduce the initial wait time. You can download and convert your world on PS5 as many times as you want.

## Linking a Microsoft account to your PSN Account

Linking your Microsoft account to the PS5 version of Minecraft allows you to access crossplay and carry over your Minecraft Marketplace purchases from other devices. See [How to Link Microsoft and PlayStation Accounts in Minecraft](../Use-or-Link-Microsoft-Accounts/Link-Your-Microsoft-Account-to-Minecraft-on-PlayStation.md).

## Authorizing Minecraft Subscription Services on PS5

If you have a Minecraft Realms or Marketplace Pass subscription on the PlayStation® 5 (PS5) version of Minecraft, you need to complete a one-time authorization of Minecraft as a trusted app to enable automatic renewal of your subscriptions. 

If you do not provide authorization and do not sign into Minecraft on your PS5 after each monthly billing, your Realms and Marketplace Pass subscriptions will appear as expired. This means you won't have access to your Realms when playing on other platforms and other Realm members won't be able to join. You'll also lose access to your Marketplace Pass catalog items on other platforms.

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Select **Account** underneath General.
4.  Select **Manage PlayStation Network Authorization**.
5.  Select **Accept and Continue**. 

## Playing Minecraft for PS5 Preview and accessing the Minecraft Store

If you wish to make purchases from the Minecraft Store, you need to use the live version for PS5. The Minecraft Store is not supported on the PS5 version of Minecraft Preview. However, all of your resource and behavior pack purchases made in the live version can be imported into PS5 Preview at any time from the Worlds tab. To learn more about Minecraft Preview, see these articles:

- [What to Know About Minecraft Preview](./What-to-Know-About-Minecraft-Preview.md)
- [How to Start a Minecraft Preview/Beta Realm](../Create-or-Join-Realms/Start-a-Minecraft-Preview-Beta-Realm.md)

## Playing Minecraft in PlayStation VR

The PS5 version of Minecraft does not have compatibility with PlayStation VR or PlayStation VR2. You will need to download the PS4 version to play with a VR headset. See [How to play Minecraft in PlayStation VR](./Play-Minecraft-in-PlayStation-VR.md). However, as of March, 2025, PlayStation VR will no longer be supported in updated Minecraft PS4 versions.
