If your Windows Minecraft installation isn’t working, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the game or even the Launcher. If that doesn’t work, we recommend resetting the Microsoft Store using the following steps:

## How to reset the Microsoft Store on Windows

Press the **Windows key** + **R** simultaneously.

Type **WSReset** into the Run window

Press **Enter**.

## How to reset the Minecraft Launcher

1.  Go to the Windows Search bar.
2.  Search for and right-click on the **Minecraft Launcher**.
3.  Select **More**.
4.  Open **App Settings**.
5.  Within these settings, click on **Repair** and **Reset**.
