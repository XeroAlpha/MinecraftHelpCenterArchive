Minecraft Beta and Preview allow you to playtest in-development features of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition before they are included in a game release. Learn how to download and install them from these articles:

- [Install & Play Minecraft Beta or Preview on Mobile Devices](./Install-Play-Minecraft-Beta-or-Preview-on-Mobile-Devices.md)
- [Install & Play Minecraft Preview on Windows PC](./Install-Play-Minecraft-Preview-on-Windows-PC.md)

## Minecraft Beta & Preview Differences and Information

- **Difference between Beta and Preview**: Minecraft Beta is only available on Android devices. Minecraft Preview is available on all other platforms that run Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Other than the platform-specific features, Beta and Preview have the same content.
- **Multiplayer games**: All players must be using the same version of Beta or Preview to join a multiplayer game. Players hosting a Realm must have an active subscription for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms. See [Play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on a Local Area Network (LAN)](../Multiplayer-Support/Play-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-on-a-Local-Area-Network-LAN.md) or [Join a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realm](../Create-or-Join-Realms/Join-a-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realm.md).
- **Customer support**: Minecraft Beta and Preview include features that are still in development, so you may encounter unexpected behavior or bugs that are outside the scope of customer support. You can help improve Minecraft by sharing [Minecraft Feedback](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us) or [Submitting a Bug Report](../../feedback/Gameplay-and-Support-Resources/Submitting-a-Bug-Report.md).
- **New feature lists**: To learn what’s new in each version, see [Beta and Preview Information and Changelogs](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/360001185332-Beta-and-Preview-Information-and-Changelogs).

To playtest Java features in-development, see [Install & Play Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshots](./Install-Play-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Snapshots.md).
