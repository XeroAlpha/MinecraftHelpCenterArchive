In most cases, Minecraft should automatically update to the latest version if you are connected to the internet. If, for whatever reason, you start up your game on a console and notice that it is running an older version, the below steps can walk you through how to manually update Minecraft.

## Nintendo Switch

1.  Find the Minecraft tile on your Switch dashboard.
2.  Press the **+** button.
3.  Open the **Software Update** tab.
4.  Select **Via the Internet** if connected to the internet.
    - If another Switch is nearby with the latest update, you can also choose **Match Version with Local Users**.

## PlayStation

1.  Find the Minecraft tile on your PlayStation dashboard or in your library.
2.  Press the **Options** button.
3.  Select **Check for Update**.
4.  The game will automatically be added to your Downloads and Installations if an update is found.

## Xbox

1.  Open **My games & apps.**
2.  Open the **Manage** tab.
3.  Select **Updates**.
4.  After a quick scan, all games in your library that need an update will be displayed.
5.  Select Minecraft or press **Update All**.
