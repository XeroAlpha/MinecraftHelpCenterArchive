When new content is released for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, you'll need to update your game to play. Updates normally happen automatically through the Launcher while your device is in standby mode or in use with an active internet connection. You may need to select **Update** on the Launcher to start the download and install process if the Launcher has not been opened.

If you do not see the option to select Update and know there is a newer version of Minecraft available, here’s how to manually download the newest version.

## How to manually update Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on PC

1.  Open the Minecraft Launcher.
2.  Select **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition** from the left tabs.
3.  Select **Installation** from the top tabs.
4.  Select **Check for Updates** for your Minecraft installation.
