Minecraft Preview is played through a separate game client from the normal Minecraft: Bedrock Edition so you can test out the latest and greatest features before they’re released in the standard version. See the information below to learn more about supported platforms and how to install the game client.

## Platforms that Support Minecraft Preview/Beta
