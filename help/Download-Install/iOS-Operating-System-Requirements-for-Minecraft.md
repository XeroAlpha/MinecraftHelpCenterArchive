As Minecraft grows, so must the operating system that supports it. If you are using the most current version of iOS already, your device will be compatible with the latest version of Minecraft.

## Minimum IOS Requirements for Minecraft

The minimum system requirements for Minecraft are listed on the [Apple App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minecraft/id479516143). These are the minimum requirements for running the game, but you may not have access to all available features and game play modes.

## Recommended IOS Requirements for Minecraft

You need to update to iOS 13 or above by February 2024 to continue receiving updates for Minecraft or to access online play.  You can refer to [Apple’s list of devices currently compatible with iOS 13/iPadOS 13](https://support.apple.com/en-us/103825).

For optimal game play performance and access to all features and gameplay modes, we recommend updating to the most recent version of IOS. Please follow [Apple’s guide on how to update your device](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204).

## Compatibility with Multiplayer and Realms

As of February 2024 updates, devices running iOS 12 or older will no longer be compatible with Minecraft Realms. Your Realm will continue to work for up to six months post-sunset. Within that timeframe, you can access the Realm on a device running iOS 13 or later, [backup the world](../Manage-or-Troubleshoot-Realms/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Realms-Backup-FAQ.md), or cancel your subscription through the Settings menu in Subscriptions on the device the Realm was created.

If you need more assistance in updating your version of iOS, [contact Apple’s support team](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210327).
