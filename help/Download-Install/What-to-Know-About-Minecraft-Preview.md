## Essential Information Before Participating in Minecraft Preview

- **Different Game Clients:** Minecraft: Bedrock Edition also includes a version called Minecraft Preview for testing features ahead of time. On Android, this version is called Beta. You must launch Preview to get access to features in development.
- **Bedrock Version Only:** Preview is exclusive to Bedrock. To learn about testing pre-release Java features, see [How to Install Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshots](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/20364354829709).
- **Realms in Preview:** If you have an active Realms subscription for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, you can start a Realm when playing Preview. However, Realms are specific to the game version. You can only access your Preview Realm when playing the Preview version of Minecraft and cannot access your Bedrock Realms when playing Preview. 
- **Multiplayer with Preview:** Your friends can join you in Preview multiplayer games, but all players must be using the Preview version of Minecraft.
- **Playing in a Test Environment:** Preview builds will likely be unstable and are not representative of the final version quality. Please back up your Worlds before joining Minecraft Preview. 
- **Preview and Verson Releases:** Finished releases may not include all changes and fixes you experience while playing Preview. Some features may not make it to production or may slip to a later release. 
- **No Preview Support:** Because Preview is a test environment, we can't provide technical support if you encounter issues. Please report bugs to the [Mojang Bug Tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa) and all feedback to[ Minecraft Feedback](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us).
