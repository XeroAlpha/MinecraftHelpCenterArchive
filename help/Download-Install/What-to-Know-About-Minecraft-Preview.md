## Essential Information Before Participating in Minecraft Preview

- Bedrock Editions of the game have a version called Minecraft Preview for testing features ahead of time. On Android, this version is called Beta.
- Preview is exclusive to Bedrock. To learn about testing pre-release Java features, see [How to Install Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshots](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/20364354829709).
- You will only have access to Preview Realms if you have an active Realms subscription. Normal Minecraft Realms are not available when playing in Minecraft Preview.
- To play with friends in Preview, everyone must be enrolled in Preview.
- Preview builds will likely be unstable and are not representative of the final version quality. Please back up your Worlds before joining Minecraft Preview. 
- Finished releases may not include all changes and fixes from Preview to preserve stability and may slip to a later release. 
- Report bugs to the [Mojang Bug Tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa) and all feedback to[ Minecraft Feedback](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us).
