Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshots allow you to play in-development versions and features of Minecraft before they are fully released if you own the full version of Minecraft: Java Edition. See [Learn about Minecraft Snapshots](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/41754960989581) for details. Here’s how to install and play the latest Snapshot in singleplayer or multiplayer.

## How to install and play the newest Snapshot

1.  Open the Minecraft Launcher.
2.  Select the **Minecraft: Java Edition** section.
3.  Select **Latest Release** to the left of the Play button to expand the version menu.
4.  Select **Latest Snapshot**.
5.  Select **Play**.

To play the latest Snapshot again later, select **Latest snapshot** from the version menu before you select Play.

## How to play multiplayer Snapshots

Players joining a multiplayer game using Snapshots must all have the same version of Snapshots installed. Players hosting a Snapshot game on a Realm must have an active Java Edition Realms subscription.

- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Launch the latest Snapshot and [Play Minecraft: Java Edition on a Local Area Network (LAN)](../Multiplayer-Support/Play-Minecraft-Java-Edition-on-a-Local-Area-Network-LAN.md).
- **Snapshots on a Realm**: Launch the latest Snapshot and [Join a Minecraft: Java Edition Realm](../Create-or-Join-Realms/Join-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realm.md).
