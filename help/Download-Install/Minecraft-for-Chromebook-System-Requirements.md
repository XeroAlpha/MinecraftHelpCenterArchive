To get the best possible experience out of Minecraft on your Chromebook, you will want to have either the minimum or recommended system requirements listed below:

## Minimum requirements

- Operating System: ChromeOS 111
- System Architecture: 64-bit (x86_64, arm64-v8a)
- Processor: AMD A4-9120C, Intel Celeron N4000, Intel 3865U, Intel i3-7130U, Intel m3-8100Y, Mediatek Kompanio 500 (MT8183), Qualcomm SC7180 or better
- Memory: 4 GB RAM
- Storage: Minimum of 1 GB game installation, maps, and other filesâ€¯

## Recommended processors

In addition to the processors listed in the minimum requirements, the following are recommended processors for better Minecraft performance:

- AMD Ryzen 3 3250C
- Intel Celeron N4500

If you meet these requirements and are looking to optimize your game further, see [Optimizing Performance in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Optimizing-Video-Settings-and-Performance-in-Minecraft.md).

## External monitors with Chromebook

When switching the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition app from a Chromebook device to an external monitor, a crash may occur depending on the graphic settings of the two devices.

- Avoid this issue by not moving the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition application between display devices and not changing "display scaling" settings on your device while the game is running. If this has happened, please relaunch your game.
