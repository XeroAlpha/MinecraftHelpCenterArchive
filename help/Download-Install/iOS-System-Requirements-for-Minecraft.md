To view the minimum iOS system requirements for Minecraft, go to the **Information** section of the [Minecraft App Store listing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minecraft/id479516143). You can view compatibility details, including OS and storage requirements.

For optimal gameplay performance and access to all features and gameplay modes, [Update your iPhone or iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118575) to the most recent iOS version or use a device with the most recent iOS version. Devices that only meet the minimum requirements may not have access to some features and gameplay modes or run as smoothly as newer devices.

## Support for older devices

As of March 2025, you must update to iOS 14 to access online play and continue receiving updates for Minecraft. See [Operating System Sunset Announcements for Minecraft](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Operating-System-Sunset-Announcements-for-Minecraft.md) for details. [iOS 14 and iPadOS are compatible with these devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/103202).
