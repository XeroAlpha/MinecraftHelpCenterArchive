Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition were released as a bundle for personal computers on June 7, 2022. If your Microsoft account owns this bundle, you can download and play both versions using the Minecraft launcher.

If you own an individual PC license for Minecraft: Java Edition or Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Windows, your license only gives you access to the edition you purchased prior to the release of the bundle. You must purchase the [Deluxe PC Collection or the Standard PC Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc?tabs=%7B%22details%22%3A0%7D) to have access to both Minecraft editions for PC.

## Identify your Minecraft game version using the Minecraft Launcher

1.  Open the Minecraft Launcher on your Windows PC. If you do not already have the Launcher, visit [Download and Install the Minecraft Launcher](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/Download-and-Install-the-Minecraft-Launcher.md).
2.  Sign in with your Microsoft account.
3.  On the sidebar, select either **Minecraft: Java Edition** or **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition**.
4.  You will either see the word **Play** if you own that version of Minecraft or the words **Buy** **Now** if you don’t own that version of Minecraft.

## Identify your Minecraft game version in the Microsoft Store

1.  Visit the [Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-for-pc/9NXP44L49SHJ/0010) page in the Microsoft store.
2.  Sign in with your Microsoft account.
3.  If you own the bundle, you will see **You Own This** and the option to **Install**. If you do not own it, you will instead see the option to **Buy**.
