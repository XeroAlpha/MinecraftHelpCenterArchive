*As of March 2025, PlayStation VR will no longer be supported in Minecraft. After the latest update at this time, you will still have full access to your Minecraft worlds and Tokens and be able to play the game without PlayStation VR.*

To play Minecraft in virtual reality on your PlayStation®, you need the following:

- Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PlayStation 4
- A PlayStation VR kit 
- A DualShock 4 controller

We also recommend you update your game to the most recent version for the best virtual reality experience. You also can play multiplayer games with others playing Bedrock Edition even if they are not in VR.

**Note:** Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PlayStation 4 is not compatible with PSVR2 headsets or PlayStation Move controllers.
