Minecraft Snapshots are available if you own Minecraft: Java Edition and allow you to playtest and preview an in-development version of Minecraft. [Install & Play Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshots](./Install-Play-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Snapshots.md) singleplayer or with friends on a Local Area Network (LAN) connection or a Realm.

To learn what’s new in each Snapshot version, go to the Patch Notes tab in the Minecraft Launcher and select the **Snapshots** checkbox to filter for the latest articles.

Minecraft Snapshots are still in development, so you may encounter unexpected behavior or bugs.
