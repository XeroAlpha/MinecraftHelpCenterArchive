If you would like to try Minecraft: Java Edition before deciding to purchase the game, [download the Minecraft launcher](https://minecraft.net/download). Demo mode lasts five in-game days or about 100 minutes in real-time. 

The demo mode is available to any Microsoft account that is logged into the launcher but does not own a purchased copy of Minecraft.

## If you are Stuck on the Demo of Minecraft

Ensure you have logged into the correct Microsoft Account that purchased Minecraft.  You can locate your Microsoft Account on the [Microsoft Help Page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/you-forgot-your-microsoft-account-username-b2049472-3b8f-27d3-61c6-67a668453f4c).**​​

Other possible issues could be:

- Your launcher is out of date. Update via Settings \> About or re-download the [Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download).
- You purchased Minecraft under a different email address, or the email address has been changed. Be sure to check your [account page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/profile) to verify your purchase of Minecraft.
- Your purchase was refunded. In this case, you will have received an email from Minecraft and will need to re-purchase the game from the [Minecraft Store](https://www.minecraft.net/de-de/store/min...).
- You just purchased Minecraft while the account was logged into the launcher, or you have not yet chosen a Java profile name. Be sure to restart your launcher and re-try.
- Make sure your system meets the [system requirements](./System-Requirements-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md#h_01FFJMSQWJH31CH16H63GX4YKE).
