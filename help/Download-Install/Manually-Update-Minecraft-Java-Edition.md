When new content is released for Minecraft: Java Edition, you'll need to update Minecraft to play. Updates normally happen automatically through the Launcher while your device is in standby mode or in use with an active internet connection. You may need to select **Update** on the Launcher to start the download and install process.

If you do not see the option to update and know there is a newer version of Minecraft available, try these troubleshooting steps.

- **Sign out and sign in to the Minecraft Launcher**: Follow steps to [Reset Your Microsoft Account Sign-in in Minecraft](../Account-Sign-in/Reset-Your-Microsoft-Account-Sign-in-in-Minecraft.md) to refresh your Minecraft connection.
- **Check your internet connection**: If you can’t connect to Minecraft servers, the Launcher won’t update. [Troubleshoot Minecraft Network Connection Errors](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot-Minecraft-Network-Connection-Errors.md) to see if it fixes the issue.
- **Repair and reset the Minecraft Launcher**: Launcher issues can prevent updates, so try to [Fix Issues with Minecraft Launcher Not Updating on a Windows PC](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/Fix-Issues-with-Minecraft-Launcher-Not-Updating-on-a-Windows-PC.md).
- **Restart your device**: Close Minecraft, restart your device, and then relaunch Minecraft.
- **Wait for the update to be distributed**: Minecraft updates are released gradually and may not be immediately available. If the update was just published, you may need to check back later.
