To play the newest content in Minecraft: Java Edition, your game needs to be updated to the most recent version. This should happen automatically while your device is in standby mode or in use while connected to an active Internet connection. However, if you need to manually update your game on Windows, you can follow the steps below.

1.  Go to the Start Menu.
2.  Right click on the Minecraft Launcher.
3.  Select **More.**
4.  Open **App Settings.**
5.  Within these settings, click on **Repair and Reset.**

If your launcher update stalls, you can reset the Microsoft Store using these steps:

1.  Press the **Windows key** + **R** simultaneously.
2.  A window will appear. Type in **WSReset** and hit enter.
