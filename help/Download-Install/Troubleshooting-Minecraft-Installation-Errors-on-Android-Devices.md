Minecraft installation errors on Android devices can be caused by previously installed files if you had Minecraft or Minecraft: Beta installed or if your download only partially completed. Here’s how to fix these errors by removing old Minecraft files.

## How to Locate and Remove Minecraft Files on Android

We recommend you [Save a Backup of your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Worlds on Android](../Backup-Restore/Save-a-Backup-of-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Worlds-on-Android.md) before you start this process to avoid losing any worlds or saved data.

1.  Connect your Android device to your computer with a USB cable.
2.  Select the **Charging this device via USB notification**.
3.  Select **File Transfer** or **MTP mode**.
4.  Open a file browser on your computer and locate the **Android** \> **data** \> **com.mojang.minecraftpe** folder. This folder may be in Internal Storage or on an External SD card.
5.  Delete **com.mojang.minecraftpe**.
6.  Disconnect your phone from your computer.
7.  Open the Google Play store and install Minecraft.

## Additional Installation Troubleshooting

- **Locating install files**: If you can’t find the com.mojang.minecraftpe folder, or this issue still happens when you try to install Minecraft, you may have Minecraft files located at **/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds**. Follow the steps above for that folder.
- **Accessing Android Scoped Storage**: If you can't access the Minecraft folder because of Android Scoped Storage, permissions, or another security feature, contact [Google Play Help](https://support.google.com/googleplay?sjid=17990395897789867044-NC#topic=3364260).
