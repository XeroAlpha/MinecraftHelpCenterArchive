Most of the time, your device should automatically update Minecraft. However, some settings and other situations can prevent automatic updates. Here is how to manually update Minecraft to the most recent version on your mobile device if necessary.

**Note:** if you are unsure if you are running the latest version of Minecraft, start the game and the version number will be displayed in the bottom right corner of the title screen.

1.  Open the App Store.
2.  Tap on your account profile in the top right.
3.  Scroll down to automatic updates and find your pending Minecraft update.
4.  Press **Update**.

## Manually update Minecraft on the Google Play Store
