Your iPhone, iPad, or Android mobile device will normally update Minecraft automatically. If you need to manually update to the most recent version, follow the instructions from your mobile OS manufacturer:

- **Android**: [How to update apps on Android](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/113412?hl=en)
- **iOS**: [How to manually update apps from the App Store](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102629)

To determine if you are running the latest version of Minecraft, start the game and note the version number displayed in the bottom-right corner of the launch screen. This should match the version number in Minecraft’s store listing:

- **Google Play Store**: Look in the about this game section of [Minecraft: Dream it, Build it! - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe)
- **iOS App Store**: Look in the version history section of [Minecraft: Dream it, Build it! on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minecraft-dream-it-build-it/id479516143)
