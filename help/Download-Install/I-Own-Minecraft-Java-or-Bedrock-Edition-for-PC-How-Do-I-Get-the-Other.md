Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Windows are now being sold as a single product. If you’ve never bought Minecraft before, you can now get both Java and Bedrock for one low price, also called Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC.

If you have bought Minecraft before, you’re now getting the other edition for free. Follow these steps to redeem it:

1.  Visit the Microsoft Store listing for [Minecraft: Java & Bedrock for PC](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-for-pc/9nxp44l49shj?ocid=storeforweb).
2.  Sign-in to the Microsoft Store with your Microsoft account.
3.  Select the **Get** button to download. 

Note: You need to be signed in and have a license for Minecraft to see the **Get** option. Otherwise, you will be prompted to buy the game.

After you download both editions, you can visit [Download and Install the Minecraft Launcher](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/Download-and-Install-the-Minecraft-Launcher.md) to access your games.
