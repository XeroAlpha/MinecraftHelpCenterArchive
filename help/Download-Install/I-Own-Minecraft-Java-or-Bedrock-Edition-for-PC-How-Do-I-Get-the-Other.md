Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Windows are now being sold as a single product. If you’ve never bought Minecraft before, you can now get both Java and Bedrock for one low price, also called Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC.

If you have bought Minecraft before, you’re now getting the other edition for free. Follow these steps to redeem it:

1.  [Click here](https://aka.ms/JavaBedrockEdition) to go to the Microsoft Store listing for Minecraft: Java & Bedrock for PC.
2.  Sign-in to the Microsoft Store with your Microsoft account.
3.  Once you’re signed in, instead of a “Buy” button you should see a button that says “Get.” Click this button – and now you own both editions!

After you have gotten both editions, you can [download and install the Minecraft Launcher](../Minecraft-Launcher-Support/How-to-Download-and-Install-the-Minecraft-Launcher.md) to access your games.
