The [Minecraft Free Trial](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/free-trial) is a limited version of Minecraft you can demo and has a few differences from the full version.

The Minecraft free trial allows:

- 90 minutes of play.
- Singleplayer access. No online multiplayer, LAN, or Realms.
- Access to Survival mode. No Creative mode.
- Limited menu options. Cannot change World Seed or World Options.

If you enjoy playing the Minecraft trial, you can [purchase Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc) to access these features.
