## What are achievements?

Achievements are optional goals laid out for players who want a bit of direction while playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. These can be as simple as crafting a wooden pickaxe and range to something as creative as flying a pig off of a cliff.

## Where can I earn achievements?

Xbox achievements can be earned in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on Xbox, PC, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch when connected to the internet. On mobile and Nintendo Switch devices, you must have a Microsoft account linked to the profile playing Minecraft for Xbox achievements to attach to that Microsoft account.

PlayStation users can earn trophies attached to their PSN accounts. While you can connect a Microsoft account to your PlayStation profile to crossplay with friends, Xbox achievements cannot be earned on the PlayStation version of Minecraft. For more information on this topic, please visit the [Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PlayStation FAQ](../Performance-Troubleshooting/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-for-PlayStation-FAQ.md).

## Can I turn achievements on or off in Realms?

If your Realm is set to **Creative mode**, achievements will be disabled for your world. Unfortunately, re-activating achievements is only possible if you have a backup from before **Cheats **or **Creative mode** was enabled. If no backups are available, then that world will remain without achievements enabled.

## My achievements are not unlocking

Players may occasionally find that when they reach an objective, the achievement is not immediately unlocked. Please allow up to 24 hours for the achievement to display. After that, if achievements are still not displaying in-game for you, follow these steps to troubleshoot the problem:

- Make sure you are connected to the internet and that your game is up to date.
  - For more help, see [Troubleshoot your Xbox network connection](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/connect-network/xbox-one-network-connection).
- Restart your device and boot-up Minecraft again.
- If possible, reattempt the feat that gained you the achievement.
- Back up your save data and uninstall Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and reinstall it on your system.

If you still need assistance, please contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).
