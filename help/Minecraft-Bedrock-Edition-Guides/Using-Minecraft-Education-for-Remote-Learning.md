COVID-19 concerns prompted school closures around the world and many parents turned to remote learning to keep students engaged.  Features like classroom [multiplayer ](https://minecrafteducation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001429408-How-To-Set-Up-A-Multiplayer-Game-)allow students to collaborate on projects in their Minecraft worlds, building, planning, learning and even chatting as they work together. When they are ready to document their work and submit their projects, students can use tools like the [Camera and Book & Quill](https://aka.ms/MEEBookAndQuill) to take screenshots, write about their work and export their in-game portfolios in PDF format.
