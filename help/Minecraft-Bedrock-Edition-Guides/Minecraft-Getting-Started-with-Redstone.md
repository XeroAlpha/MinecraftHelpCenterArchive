Redstone is one of the more advanced elements in Minecraft. You can obtain it either by mining a block of redstone ore or by acquiring it from mob/dungeon loot. Redstone occurs across certain biomes in lower levels of the terrain. You are more likely to see redstone ore in caverns in cube-shaped veins. 

To mine redstone dust from a block of redstone ore, you must be wielding a pickaxe of iron or higher quality material. 

After you mine enough redstone ore, it has multiple uses and applications. You can use redstone in nearly limitless ways, but some of the most common uses are as follows: 

- Traps 
- Lighting 
- Crafting 
- Automatic farms 
- Automatic doors 
- Defending your home 
- Moving and storing items

While redstone is a block and item in the game, the term can refer to all items that can interact with or be controlled by redstone. Some items in the redstone family may not be immediately obvious, such as the following: 

- Observer blocks 
- Hoppers 
- Pistons 
- Doors 
- Pressure plates 
- and more 

Redstone unlocks nearly limitless capabilities in Minecraft. While we can't teach you everything there is to know about redstone, the redstone community has grown so large that a guide to building that TNT cannon you’ve always wanted is just an online search away. 

With redstone, the sky is the limit—up to 319 blocks, of course!
