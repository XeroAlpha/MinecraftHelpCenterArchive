*This article applies to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition only. See our [Mods for Minecraft: Java Edition](../Minecraft-Java-Edition-Guides/Mods-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition.md)* *article for customization for Minecraft: Java Edition.*

## What are add-ons? What do they add to the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition experience?

Add-ons give you the ability to change the way things in your game look and behave; add-ons help you bring new gameplay ideas to life. They are the first step in your journey towards a fully customizable Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

Add-ons is a first step towards customizing the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Head over to [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/addons/) to learn more about add-ons. 

We are releasing two sample add-ons available for free download: one was created by our devs here at Team Minecraft, and one was created by community members SethBling, BlockWorks and the Mindcrack crew.

To download the add-ons see the [Minecraft add-ons](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/addons) page and follow the installation instructions.

Here is a fun video that provides a quick introduction to add-ons, along with playthroughs and tutorials. To give you an idea of how add-ons work and what you can make with them, see [Minecraft add-ons videos](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/addons)!

### Will add-ons run on my version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition?

Add-ons will work on any platform that runs Minecraft: Bedrock Edition; you can even experience them in VR with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for Windows. They’ll also work in multiplayer and on Realms, so you can play with friends.

### Do you have any examples of what add-ons can enable?

- They can change the rules of the game.
- Transform the look of your world.
- Change the appearances and mechanics of things in the game.
- Change the way mobs look and behave.
- Change a chicken to behave like a creeper (attack and explode).
- Change the blast radius of a creeper, or the texture it’s wearing.

## How do I use add-ons?

You can download add-ons from the internet or create your own:

1.  To install new add-ons, follow the instructions at [minecraft.net/addons](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/addons). Once you’ve installed them, you can apply them to different worlds by navigating to the Behavior Pack or Resource Pack tabs in the World Settings.
2.  To create your own add-ons, Minecraft's unmodified files are a good place to start. Download these zips of the [resource packs](https://aka.ms/resourcepacktemplate) and [behavior packs](https://aka.ms/behaviorpacktemplate) and get creative.

## Can you tell me more about how add-ons work?

All mobs are made up of components that define their appearance and behavior. For instance, a chicken has behaviors that make it attracted to seeds, and a model that makes it look like a chicken. With add-ons, you can take any existing component of a mob and remix them across other mobs. For example, you could add a ridable component to the chicken to ride it.

### How do I use add-ons on Realms?

To use add-ons on Realms, first read the instructions above in “How do I use add-ons?” Then if you want to add your add-on to a Realm, navigate to the Behavior Pack or Resource Pack tab in your Realm settings. From there you can manage all the add-ons active on your Realm.  

You can also upload a new world to your Realm which already has the add-ons added to it. Remember that you will be replacing both the world and all the add-ons currently active by doing this. 

If you want to add an add-on from Marketplace, purchase the content, and use the “Create on Realms” button to upload the content directly to your Realm. You can also use the above methods to add the add-ons to your Realm for Marketplace content. 

If you connect to a Realm from any Minecraft: Bedrock Edition device, you will automatically get any add-ons applied to that Realm. 

## Why doesn’t my add-on work on my Realm when it works in my local world?

There are several differences in how add-ons work in a Realm, compared to applying to a local world. In fact, your own created add-ons on Realms need to follow the same rules as any Marketplace add-on. This means that add-ons you develop yourself or download from the Internet needs to have a unique ID, UUID. If the UUID already exists, your add-on will not be applied. Also, whenever you update the add-on you need to change the version number, for example increasing from 1.0 to 1.1.  

If you find your add-on does not work as intended on Realms, make sure to check the following: 

1.  Did you re-use a UUID from another add-on? Re-using UUIDs is not allowed, so be sure to create a new unique UUID for your add-on. 
2.  After making changes to your add-on, did you change the version number? If not, Realms might re-use the old content already uploaded to Realms and you might not get the version applied that you are trying to upload. 

Remember that for your own add-ons – create a unique UUID and make sure to update the version number when uploading a new version to Realms! 

## How do I use add-ons on Realms?

To use add-ons on Realms, follow these steps:

1.  Open Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and click “Play”
2.  Apply an add-on to a world (for instructions on how to do this, see “How do I use add-ons?”)
3.  Go to the “Realms” tab and select the “edit world” icon to the right of the world name.
4.  Click “Replace World,” and chose the world to which you’ve just applied the add-on.

If you connect to a Realm from any Minecraft: Bedrock Edition device, you will automatically get any add-ons applied to that Realm.

## Will there be a way to create and edit add-ons directly in the game?

We have no plans to support creating or editing add-ons in-game.

## Will there be an official Marketplace for add-ons?

Yes! Many of the worlds in the [Minecraft Marketplace](https://marketplace.minecraft.net/) contain add-ons made by creators in the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition community directly in-game! With Minecraft Marketplace, we’ve made it safer and easier to purchase community-made content for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

## Are add-ons editable on mobile phones (iOS, Android, etc) as well as on Windows 10 and above PCs?

We recommend editing add-ons on PCs. However, depending on the operating system your device supports, you may be able to edit on mobile.

## If you make a mistake editing or creating an add-on, will it break your world?

We recommend experimenting with add-ons in new worlds before using them on existing worlds. As you’re learning to use add-ons it's going to be possible to do awesome things, like blowing up your world or creating a monster that fills your world with fireballs or lava. You may be so good at creating monsters that those splendid new mobs end up eating your worlds before you can stop them. Builders beware. ;)

## What’s the difference between McWorld and McPack files?

McWorld files are worlds that contain add-ons. McPacks are add-ons that you can apply to your worlds.

## What happens when I edit existing add-ons?

If you apply an add-on to a world, and then go back and edit the original add-on, your changes will not appear in the original world. You can either remove the old add-on from the world and apply the new or apply the new add-on to a new world. For instructions on how to apply add-ons, see “How do I apply add-ons” above.

## Unofficial Help Resources

There are lots and lots of other Minecraft: Bedrock Edition players out there so it’s quite likely that someone else has already encountered the same problem as you. The Minecraft: Bedrock Edition community is also a great help resource, especially when it comes to dealing with more technical issues.
