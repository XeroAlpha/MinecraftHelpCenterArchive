From time to time, Minecraft will host special events that allow players to join special-made worlds for some limited-time fun. If you are having issues getting into the world, here are some possible solutions.

## Are you signed into a Microsoft Account? 

Online play in Minecraft requires you to be signed in with a Microsoft Account or an Xbox account. If you are playing on iOS, Android, PlayStation, or Switch, it is possible you haven’t made one yet. Creating a Microsoft Account is free and easy. 

For more information on a Microsoft account, see [What is a Microsoft Account.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/what-is-a-microsoft-account-4a7c48e9-ff5a-e9c6-5a5c-1a57d66c3bfa)

If you’re unable to access Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in general, please make sure you’re signed into the Microsoft account that owns Minecraft or is subscribed to Xbox Game Pass.

## Are you trying to join the right game?

Special Minecraft event worlds are exclusive to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If you are trying to join in using other Minecraft games like Java Edition, Dungeons, or Legends, you will not find these worlds. Please install and boot-up Bedrock Edition to join special events.

## Are you using a child account? 

If you’re playing on a child account, you may need a parent’s assistance with changing parental controls.  

Whether you’re connecting to the event on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, or our various other Bedrock Edition platforms, ensure your Microsoft and PlayStation/Nintendo account (if applicable) has the proper parental controls enabled so you can join an online game. 

See [How to Manage Parental Consent](../Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition/Set-Up-Microsoft-Family-Accounts-for-Minecraft-multiplayer-games.md) for more information on parental settings and controls. 

## Is your game up to date? 

Ensure that your game is up to date. If it is not, update it and try accessing the game and world again. Otherwise, make sure that you’re connecting with a stable internet connection and not behind a firewall that prevents online play.
