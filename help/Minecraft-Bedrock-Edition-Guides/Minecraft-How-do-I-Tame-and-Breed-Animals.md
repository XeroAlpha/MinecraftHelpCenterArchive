Have you ever been walking around the Overworld with food in your hand and notice that a nearby animal mob is following and staring at you? That little guy would like a snack but using that food will allow you to tame and breed various animals. Here is a breakdown on how taming and breeding animals work in Minecraft.

## Taming 

Taming is the process of domesticating a wild animal to befriend a player. Only certain animals can be tamed. Here are the ways you can tame these animals and how they interact after being tamed: 

### Wolf

Wolves can be tamed by giving them Bones you have gathered. Keep in mind, you may need to have multiple on hand, as just one does not guarantee the Wolf to respect you. When hearts and a collar appear from the Wolf, it has been tamed.

Once you notice a red collar appear on its neck, that Wolf will follow you around dutifully, attacking most (but not all!) hostile mobs and other players that deal damage to you or you attack. You can also tell them to sit in a spot where they will remain until you give them the okay to follow you again.

### Cat

Cats love Raw Salmon or Raw Cod, so if you see a group of kittens walking around a Village or Witch\'s Hut, be sure to pull out your Fishing Rod at the nearest body of water. Don\'t run after the cat you want to tame, or it will be spooked and flee. Approach slowly by crouch walking to it and give them the fish until the hearts and a red collar appears around their neck.

Once tamed, Cats will follow you similar to a Wolf, but they don\'t attack anyone who hurts you. However, when they are nearby, those pesky Creepers and Phantoms will stop attacking you. There is also a chance that your feline friend will give you an item gift after a night of sleeping in a Bed.

### Horses, Donkeys, and Mules

In contrast to Wolves and Cats, Horses, Donkeys, and Mules don\'t need an item to tame them. Instead, get close enough to them and interact to get on their back. The first couple of times they will buck you off, but if you keep getting on, they will eventually relax and let you stay on them. Hearts will appear denoting they trust you.

After a Horse, Donkey, or Mule has been tamed, you can ride it as much as you want. However, to control where it moves, you will need to put a Saddle on it. If you don\'t have one, use a Lead to take it home and keep it from wandering off on its own. Horses are faster and can be given Horse Armor to protect them. Donkeys and Mules are slower but can be equipped with a Chest to carry more items for you.

In an additional special case, if you come across a Skeleton Horse, you can tame it by killing its original rider. In Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, it does not need a Saddle to control it.

### Llamas

Llamas are tamed similarly to Horses, Donkeys, and Mules by trying to ride them repeatedly. However, where they differ is you can not give them a Saddle to control where they walk. Instead, you should use a Lead to get them to go where you want, while giving them a Chest to carry more items. After you leash a Llama, other Llamas in the area will follow them in a caravan.

### Parrots

To tame a Parrot, you need to give it any kind of Seeds. Whatever you do, do not feed it a Cookie, as that is poisonous and will kill your wanted companion.

After your Parrot has gotten enough Seeds to make hearts appear from it, you can tell that bird to sit or follow you as you travel. If you walk into it or it flies to you, the Parrot can perch on one of your shoulders and you may hear it mimic the sound of other mobs.

## Breeding 

Players can initiate breeding with two mobs of the same species to produce offspring. To do this, two animals must be in the same vicinity and be in \"love mode\" in which animals will emit hearts.

Animals that can be bred have certain items that will put them into "love mode." When this happens, hearts will pop off from the mob and they will look for another animal they are compatible with to create a baby. Some animals must be tamed before they can be bred. Here are the animals that you can breed, and the food items used to breed them: 

-   **Wolves (Tamed)** - any raw or cooked meat other than fish 
-   **Cats (Tamed)/Ocelots** - Raw Cod or Raw Salmon 
-   **Horses/Donkeys (Tamed)** - Golden Apples and Golden Carrots 
-   **Llamas (Tamed)** - Hay Bales 
-   **Sheep, Cows, Goats, and Mooshrooms** - Wheat 
-   **Pigs** - Carrots, Potatoes, or Beetroot
-   **Chicken** - Seeds (will also produce Eggs on their own without any influence)
-   **Rabbits** - Dandelions, Carrots, or Golden Carrots 
-   **Turtles** - Seagrass 
-   **Pandas** - Bamboo; you must have eight Bamboo blocks within a radius of five blocks of both Pandas
