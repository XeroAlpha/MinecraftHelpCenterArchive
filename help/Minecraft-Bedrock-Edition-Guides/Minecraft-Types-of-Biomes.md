## Do Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition share the same biomes? 

Yes, both Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition usually have the same biomes. However, because the games are updated at different times you may see a temporary discrepancy. Other in-game locations such as villages and temples differ between versions. 

## What is a biome? 

A biome is a Minecraft region with unique geography, plants, and other characteristics. Biomes can have different environments, such as forests and deserts.

## What is a mob? 

Mobs are \"mobile creatures\" that can spawn in different biomes. They can be passive, neutral, and hostile, and can spawn in different biomes under certain conditions. 

## Current Biomes in Minecraft 

### Plains 

Plains are a common biome, usually treeless. They spawn many passive mobs such as pigs, cows, sheep, and horses. They usually border forests. Sunflower plains are the only biome where you can find sunflowers.

### Forests 

Forests are great places to start because some of them have lots of trees for harvesting wood. Other variations of forest include the flower forest that grows nearly every kind of flower in Minecraft. Birch and dark oak forests are normal forests with variations in the colors of trees being light or dark.  Dark oak forests are the only biome that can spawn woodland mansions. Be careful because the mansions and forests can contain hostile mobs. You can sometimes also find large mushrooms there.

### Jungles 

Three types of jungle biomes occur in Minecraft. The first is a normal jungle biome and the second is a sparse jungle biome. Sparse jungle biomes are essentially mixed biomes to transition from jungle biomes into others. The third variation is a bamboo jungle, which you can often find inside larger jungle biomes. You can find pandas mostly in bamboo jungles.

### Windswept Hills

You know you\'re in a Windswept Hills when you see a lot of stone, floating islands, alcoves, and spires. Windswept Hills biomes are also the only places where you can find emeralds, which are great for trading with villagers. Two other mountain biomes are the gravelly and wooded mountain biomes. As the name suggests, gravelly mountain biomes have a lot of gravel blocks instead of stone. Normally trees don\'t grow in gravelly mountain biomes so look for trees in a wooded mountain biome.

### Deserts 

Desert biomes are very bare. They contain sand, sandstone, dead bushes, brown rabbits, and cacti. In these biomes you can sometimes find desert villages, pillager outposts, temples, and the occasional river.

### Taiga 

Taiga biomes combine jungle and forest biomes. They typically have spruce trees and ferns. Taigas can contain wolves, foxes, sweet berry bushes, villages, pillager outposts, and more. The old growth pine taiga variation of the taiga biome contains much larger spruce trees and podzol on the ground. Snow taiga biomes can have wolves and arctic foxes. Taiga mountain biomes are more difficult to traverse due to their mountains, hostile mobs, and occasional snow.

### Cherry Grove

Cherry Grove biomes are filled with Cherry Blossom trees. These plants are covered in beautiful pink blossoms that gently fall to the ground below. If you harvest the wood, you can use it to create pink wooden items for your home area. Don\'t forget to grab a Cherry Tree Sapling to plant anywhere you want!

### Snowy Plains

Snowy plains biomes feature vast amounts of land covered in snow. Wildlife is scarce but they do have polar bears and rabbits.

### Ice Spikes 

The rare ice spikes biome presents large structures and clumps of ice scattered around almost like trees. Resources here are even more difficult to find than in the snow tundra biome, but this biome does have large amounts of ice.

### Swamps 

Swamp biomes are usually one of the most dangerous biomes to survive in. Witch huts generate in these biomes and slime spawns occur naturally at night. 

![blobid8.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4404137035533)

### Savannahs 

In normal savannah biomes, you can find acacia trees, and herds of horses and llamas. Villages and pillager outposts can generate in these biomes as well. Windswept savannahs have steep mountains, deep lakes, waterfalls of lava or water, and random craters. 

![blobid9.png](https://minecrafthelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4404133146381)

### Badlands 

Standard badlands contain large veins of gold and lots of red sand. Abandoned mineshafts are about the only structures you will find here and hostile mobs spawn at night. Eroded badlands are a rarer variation, with canyons in sight. Eroded badlands often generate on their own, unlike standard badlands that are common next to deserts. Wooded badlands are a smaller biome where you will often find oak trees in small numbers.

### Beaches 

Beach biomes are constructed whenever an ocean meets another biome. Aside from sand, here you can find sugar cane, shipwrecks, buried treasure, and turtles. Sometimes the beaches are snowy.

### Stony Shore 

Stony shore biomes often occur when a mountainous biome is generated near an ocean. These biomes are usually very small.

### Rivers 

River biomes usually cut through multiple biomes, and can contain sugar cane, sand, clay, squid, salmon, and drowned within them. Frozen rivers are essentially the same except with snow, and with a reduced number of hostile mobs that can spawn.

### Oceans 

The first of five variations of ocean biomes is a basic ocean where seagrass, kelp, and fish commonly abound. Warm ocean biomes typically look vibrant. These biomes can naturally generate coral reefs where you can find dolphins, pufferfish, and tropical fish. Lukewarm oceans do not contain coral reefs but feature more seagrass and kelp.

They also gain cod, salmon, and the possibility for ocean monuments. Cold ocean biomes have less aquatic wildlife but still have cod, salmon, and dolphins. You can sometimes find ocean monuments in the water\'s deep-blue hue. Frozen ocean biomes contain only salmon, squid, and ocean monuments. Where there\'s ice, you can sometimes find polar bears on the surface of the water.

### Mushroom Islands 

Mushroom field biomes are very rare and usually generate in the middle of the ocean, far away from any other biome. These are large islands composed of mycelium that accelerates and encourages the growth of mushrooms. You can also find mooshrooms in this biome. No hostile mobs can spawn in this biome.

### The Nether 

The Nether biome is separate from the Overworld. The Nether has recently updated to include multiple biomes including Soul Sand Valleys and Crimson forests. Nether fortresses contain exclusive resources. Mobs such as blaze, hoglins, piglins, and ghasts congregate here. With expanded biomes and respawn anchors you can make the Nether your permanent home.

### The End 

The End biomes are usually comprised of five features. The End is separate from the Overworld and the Nether and is guaranteed to generate whenever you create an End portal. Here, a giant center island is surrounded by several smaller areas and islands. End islands are smaller islands floating between voids and larger parts of the End. You can find Endermen here. End midlands are larger areas that transition you from the center to the outer edges of the End. They contain Shulkers, Endermen, End gateway portals, and End cities. End highlands are the main biome in the End where you find End cities and chorus trees. End gateway portals are commonly found at the outermost edge of the void. You usually find End barrens toward the edges of the main areas or land in the End, like beaches in the Overworld.
