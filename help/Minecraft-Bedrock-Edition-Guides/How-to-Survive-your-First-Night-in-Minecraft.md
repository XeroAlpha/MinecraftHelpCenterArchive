Starting a new world in Minecraft is an exciting time. You know you have an infinite amount of adventure ahead of you, filled with ores to mine, biomes to see, and various things to build. However, if you are new to the game, your first night can be overwhelming if you are not prepared. Here are some tips to survive the first night in Minecraft.

## Prepare for the night

When you first spawn into your world, it will be the middle of the day and your timer before nightfall has already begun. [It's time to get started](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/19754515644941). The best course of action before the zombies, skeletons, and spiders come out is to gather resources and prepare for the night ahead.

We recommend finding a place to make a little shelter first. You can gather blocks and build your own little house, dig into the ground to make some shelter, or move yourself into a nearby village. This doesn't need to be your permanent home, just an area you can protect yourself in the short term.

While finding your house, there are some particular resources to keep your eyes out for. Making some tools like a pickaxe and sword will give you a better chance to fend off hostile mobs. You will also want to start gathering some food. Cows, pigs, and chickens are great, but if you find sheep you can get some mutton as well as wool blocks that can go towards crafting a bed. That bed will let you create a new spawn point and skip through the night when placed in a safe spot, completely negating the need to fight off those hostile mobs.

If you have not been able to get a bed or find a suitable shelter situation, you could consider lighting up the area around you. If you find some coal to mine, or create charcoal in a furnace, you can craft torches. With enough of those torches spread around the area, those mobs looking to ruin your day won't spawn nearby.

Surviving your first night in Minecraft can be a scary thought, but once you are prepared, you will be able to handle just about anything that goes bump in the night. For more help, check out this [Tips for Beginners page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/minecraft-tips-for-beginners).
