After you purchase content on the Minecraft Marketplace or subscribe to Marketplace Pass, you obviously want to use that content. Of course, you can always select Download on the contentâ€™s store page to get it implemented, but there are faster ways than having to search for it all. Here is how:

## Where to find your Marketplace content

If you are looking to download and use add-ons, skins, worlds, textures, or mash-up packs, follow the steps below to quickly find them.

1.  Start Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
2.  Select **Marketplace**.
3.  On the left side menu, select **My Content** (the symbol of library books).
4.  Find and select the content you are looking for either in the **Owned** or **Marketplace Pass** section.
5.  Select either **Download**, **Create this World**, or **Equip** when you find the content.

## Where to find Dressing Room content

If you are just looking for skins, character creator items, capes, or emotes to equip, follow these steps:

1.  Start Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
2.  Select **Dressing Room**.
3.  Select the **three lines** at the top left to open the side menu.
4.  All items for customizing your character will be in these sections.
