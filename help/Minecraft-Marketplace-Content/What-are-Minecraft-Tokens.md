Minecraft Tokens are digital currency you buy with real money to purchase digital content in the Minecraft Store on PlayStation. Tokens are similar to Minecoins, but are only usable on PlayStation.

While non-exclusive content purchased on other platformsâ€™ Minecraft Marketplace can be used on PlayStation, your Minecoins must be used on other Bedrock platforms. If you purchase non-exclusive content in the Minecraft Store on PlayStation, that content will be usable on other Bedrock platforms.

Tokens cannot be converted into Minecoins or vice versa.
