To deactivate Add-Ons from a World follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the Edit World screen for your World.
2.  Click on the **Resource Packs** or **Resource Packs** tab, revealing the Add-Ons that are activated on your world.
3.  Click on the Add-On you’d like to remove and click **Deactivate**.
4.  Click **OK** to deactivate the Add-On.

When removing the Add-On, anything added such as mobs and some types of placeable blocks, will be removed from the world. Any blocks from the Add-On will be replaced with update blocks.

**Note**: deactivating a pack after playing a world might have unexpected results. We suggest you make a copy of your world before deactivating any Add-Ons.
