The Minecraft Support Virtual Agent, known as Merl, is a conversational AI agent designed to help Minecraft players with their support questions related to Minecraft. Merl takes text or voice-based questions from players and uses generative AI to search through trusted knowledge bases (such as articles on the Minecraft Help website) to find the best answers. A player visiting the Minecraft Help website will see the green chat bubble button in the lower right corner of their screen, which when clicked will show a floating container with the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent chat experience.

## How the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent Works

The Minecraft Support Virtual Agent leverages Minecraft Help Article content to help players with their support questions. Players won’t need to wait in a support queue to use the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent. If more specialized support is needed than the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent can provide, it can facilitate a hand-off to a human support agent. 

## Limitations of the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent

While the Support Virtual Agent can help answer player questions using trusted knowledge resources and provide live updates from a handful of Xbox and Minecraft services, the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent cannot take any action on behalf of the player at this time. Instead, the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent will summarize action steps and point players to the support resources that they need. When presented with questions outside its knowledge base, the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent may not be able to provide accurate answers.

## Settings and options available to customers using the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent

Players using the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent have the option to:

- Turn off the character visual and/or mute the character voice.
- Switch between voice and/or text-based interaction.
- Minimize the chat window to use the Help site.
- Restore the chat window to continue the conversation.
- Save character visibility and voice options to your browser.

## Alternatives to the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent

The following support options are available if you don't want to use the Minecraft Support Virtual Agent: 

- **Self-service using the Minecraft Help Center:** Search or browse for information and solutions.
- **Email support from our Helper team:** Submit an inquiry through our intake form. Click the **Contact Support** link on any Help page.
