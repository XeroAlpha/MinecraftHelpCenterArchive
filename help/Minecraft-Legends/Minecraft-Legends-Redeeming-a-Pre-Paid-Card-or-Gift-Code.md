This article applies only to Minecraft Legends pre-paid cards and gift codes. For information about redeeming other Minecraft gift codes, see [Minecraft Pre-Paid Codes](../Purchases-Billing/Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Gift-Code-Issues-FAQ.md). 

**Note: If you purchased the physical deluxe edition of Minecraft Legends, you’ll notice that there is a physical code within the box for the ‘Carrot Commander Skin Pack.’ Please make sure you attempt to redeem this code before contacting Minecraft Support.**

** **There are various ways to purchase Minecraft Legends. However, if you receive the game through a pre-paid card or a gift code, you must redeem them through one of several websites. 

Minecraft Legends pre-paid cards can be used on a new or existing Microsoft account and will entitle the cardholder to one Minecraft Legends license (a.k.a. one copy of Minecraft Legends).  

The steps in this article cover redeeming a Minecraft Legends pre-paid card purchased in a store for the Windows version of the game. **If you have purchased a Minecraft Legends gift code for another platform, see the list below:**
