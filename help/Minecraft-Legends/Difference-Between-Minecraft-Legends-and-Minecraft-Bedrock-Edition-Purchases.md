If you have hopped into Minecraft Legends, you will notice that there is a Marketplace, similar to what you would see in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. You may be wondering if there are any similarities between them?

While the stores share the “Marketplace” name, they hold exclusive content to each other. Any items that you buy in the Minecraft Legends Marketplace is not available in Bedrock, and vice versa. However, if you are connected to the same Microsoft account, your currently available Minecoins are usable on either game’s store. If you end up having some left over after a purchase, you can bank them for the other game!
