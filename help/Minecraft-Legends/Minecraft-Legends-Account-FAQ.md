Minecraft Legends is best played with friends. If you have friends playing on a different platform, you will need to connect a Microsoft account to use crossplay. Below are the steps to connect your Microsoft account to Minecraft Legends if playing on Nintendo, PlayStation, or Steam. Xbox and PC players sign in with Microsoft accounts and do not need to link.

## How to set up crossplay in Minecraft Legends

1.  Start Minecraft Legends.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Under the **Accounts** tab, select **Sign in to Microsoft account**.
4.  Select **Link Accounts**.
5.  On either a desktop or mobile browser, go to the [Microsoft linking page](https://login.live.com/oauth20_remoteconnect.srf).
6.  Input the code in the game and sign into your account.
7.  When done, you will get a message saying sign-in successful.

**Note:** a Microsoft account can only be linked to one PlayStation and Nintendo account in Minecraft Legends at a time. If the sign-in fails, you may have already connected it to a separate account in the game in the past. Log in to that old account and unlink it so you can link it to the new account.
