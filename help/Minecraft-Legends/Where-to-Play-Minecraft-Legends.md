Minecraft Legends is an exciting strategy game that allows you to build up an army of mobs to fight off the Piglin invasion. Luckily, if you are looking to get into the game, there are quite a few ways to do it. Here are all of the platforms where you can play Minecraft Legends.

- Nintendo Switch
- PlayStation 4 (also playable on PlayStation 5)
- Steam
- Xbox Game Pass for Console or PC
- Xbox One (also playable on Xbox Series X\|S)

You can purchase Minecraft Legends from [the Minecraft Legends website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/legends-standard-edition).

**Note:** Minecraft Legends on PC only supports XInput compatible controllers. This means the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller will not work with Minecraft Legends on PC.
