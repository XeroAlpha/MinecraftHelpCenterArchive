With the update of iOS 14, Apple has introduced many new privacy features. For example, players are prompted with a notification upon opening Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for the first time. “Minecraft would like to find and connect to devices on your local network.”

You must select OK and allow this connection because you will not be able to sign in to your account without allowing this permission. Some features, such as the Marketplace and single player worlds, may still work, but multiplayer and Realms will not be available.  

If you already declined this popup, you may be unable to log in until Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is updated for iOS 14. We are currently working on updating the game, but you may still encounter this bug until the patch is complete. Thank you for your patience.
