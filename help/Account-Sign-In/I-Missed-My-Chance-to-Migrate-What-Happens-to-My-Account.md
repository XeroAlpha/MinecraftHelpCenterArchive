**The migration process for Mojang accounts officially ended as of December 18, 2023. For more information about accounts compatible with supported platforms, see [Accounts Required to Play Minecraft](../Account-Setup/Accounts-Required-to-Play-Minecraft.md) and [Different Minecraft Editions](../Buying-Minecraft-Games/Different-Minecraft-Editions.md).**

## What happened to my Java Edition account?

In an effort to increase account security and create a unified Minecraft ecosystem, a [Minecraft: Java Edition migration](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house) from Mojang to Microsoft accounts was announced October 21, 2020. The migration grace period [concluded December 18, 2023](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/account-migration-last-call). **As the migration period has ended, Minecraft Support will no longer assist with migration-related queries.**

To continue playing Minecraft, you can purchase both Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock edition as one product on [the Xbox Store](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-for-pc/9NXP44L49SHJ/0010) or explore [Different Minecraft Editions](../Buying-Minecraft-Games/Different-Minecraft-Editions.md) for other platforms.

## What happened to my Minecraft: Java Edition worlds?

You may have Minecraft: Java edition single-player worlds stored on your hard drive but will not be able to play them until you [purchase Minecraft: Java Edition](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-for-pc/9NXP44L49SHJ/0010) using a Microsoft account.

If you create a new Microsoft account to play in an existing multiplayer world/server, you will join as a new player and spawn in at the world’s default spawn point with no items. If you had a base with items in it, you can then head there to regain any stored items.

## What happened to my capes, skins, and username?

Capes and skins tied to previous Java Edition accounts are not recoverable. When you create a new account, you’ll have to create a new username; your previous username may or may not be available.
