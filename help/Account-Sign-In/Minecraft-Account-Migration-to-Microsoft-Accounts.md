As of December 18, 2023, the post-migration process for Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts for access to Minecraft has officially ended. If you successfully completed the post-migration process, you should now have access to both Java and Bedrock editions.

As the migration period has concluded, Minecraft Support will no longer assist with account-related questions. Please visit these pages for help with your Microsoft account:
