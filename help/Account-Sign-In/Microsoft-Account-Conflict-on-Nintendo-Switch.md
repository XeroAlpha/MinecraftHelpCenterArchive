When you play Minecraft on your Nintendo Switch®, we’ll automatically store your Minecraft Marketplace purchases under your Nintendo Services account so they’ll be available if you play on different Switch consoles or uninstall Minecraft.

If you've played Minecraft recently while signed in with a Nintendo Account or a Nintendo Account linked to a Microsoft account, we've already enabled this for you. In some situations, you may receive a sign-in error when you start Minecraft. If you do get an error, follow the steps below fix it:

## Error: Can’t sign in

If you get the error message **Can’t sign in: That Microsoft account has already been linked to another Nintendo Account**, this means that you likely have more than one Nintendo Services Account, and the Microsoft account you are trying to link is associated with a different Nintendo Account. You can’t use the same Microsoft account for two different Nintendo Accounts. To solve this error, you can: 

- **Sign in with another Nintendo Account**: If you have more than one Nintendo Account and the Microsoft account you want to use is already linked, sign in using your other Nintendo Account.  
- **Unlink the Microsoft account**: Sign into the Nintendo account linked to the Microsoft account you want to use and unlink the two accounts. Then sign in with your previous Nintendo Account and attempt linking your Microsoft account again. See [How to Unlink Your Nintendo Account from your Microsoft Account in Minecraft](./How-to-Unlink-Your-Nintendo-Account-from-your-Microsoft-Account-in-Minecraft.md) for more information.

## Error: Microsoft Account Conflict

If you get the error message **Microsoft Account Conflict: Your Nintendo Account can now be used to access Marketplace purchases. However, since it’s already connected to a Microsoft account, we’ve signed you out \[Previous Microsoft account\]**, this means that the Nintendo account you are using was linked to a different Microsoft account and your Nintendo account was unlinked from the previous Microsoft account. You can: 

- **Use the new Microsoft account**: Continue using the Microsoft account you just used to sign in. Purchases on the previous Microsoft account noted in the error message won’t be available when playing on Nintendo Switch. 
- **Change Microsoft accounts**: Sign out and attempt linking again with the Microsoft account noted in the error message to re-establish the previous account linking.  See [How to Link Your Microsoft Account to Minecraft on Nintendo Switch](./How-to-Link-Your-Microsoft-Account-to-Minecraft-on-Nintendo-Switch.md) for more information.
