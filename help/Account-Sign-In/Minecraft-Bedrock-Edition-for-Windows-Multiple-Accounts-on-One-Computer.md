By default, you are limited to one Microsoft account per computer user account. This can make switching between accounts difficult. You can change this, though it requires a bit of advanced setup. To keep things clear, the following two terms are used:

- **Microsoft Account**- This is the account you use to log into the Microsoft Store and Minecraft.
- **Computer user account**- This is the computer account that you log into when you start up your computer.

To use multiple Microsoft accounts on one computer, you can create a different computer user account for each purchase of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition you have.

**Note: Each Minecraft: Bedrock Edition purchase will use a different Microsoft account login.**

1.  Click the **Start button** in Windows, click **Settings (cogwheel)**, go to **Accounts**, and then click **Other Users**.
2.  Click **Add someone else to this PC** and fill in their information. You can choose to create a user with a Microsoft account or make a local user without an account.Â 
3.  ***Do not use an exclamation mark or Minecraft: Bedrock Edition will not run.***
4.  Log in to the other Microsoft account associated with the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition profile you want to use for this computer user account.
5.  Download Minecraft: Bedrock Edition from the Microsoft Store.
