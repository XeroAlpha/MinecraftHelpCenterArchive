If you want to play Minecraft with friends on other platforms, you will need to sign in to a Microsoft account.

There are two possible scenarios where you might not be able to sign into your Microsoft account in Minecraft on PlayStation.

- **Error: The Microsoft account you are trying to sign into is linked to a different PSN account.**
  - [Try linking to a different PSN account](../Performance-Troubleshooting/How-to-Link-and-Unlink-Microsoft-and-PlayStation-Accounts-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md). Each Microsoft account can only be linked to one PSN account and vice versa.
- **Error: You are trying to sign into the wrong Microsoft account**.
  - If you are trying to sign into the wrong Microsoft account, a message will appear telling you the account your PSN is connected to. Login to that account. You can then unlink and use a different account if you wish.

See [How to Link a Microsoft Account to Your PlayStation Account in Minecraft](../Performance-Troubleshooting/How-to-Link-and-Unlink-Microsoft-and-PlayStation-Accounts-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) for information about account linking.
