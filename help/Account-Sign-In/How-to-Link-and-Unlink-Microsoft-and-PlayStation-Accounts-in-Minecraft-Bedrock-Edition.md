If you want to play with friends on different platforms or join Realms on Minecraft for PlayStation, you will need to link a Microsoft account to your PlayStation Network (PSN) account. Here is how to do that.

### How to connect your Microsoft account to PlayStation in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

1.  Launch Minecraft on your PlayStation.
2.  Select **Sign in with a Microsoft account** on the title screen.
3.  Visit the [code redemption site on a browser](https://login.live.com/oauth20_remoteconnect.srf).
4.  Input the code that your game is displaying.
5.  Sign in to the Microsoft account you want associated with your PlayStation account.

**Note:** only one Microsoft account can be associated with any PlayStation account at any one time. If the account you are trying to sign into has already been linked, you will need to use a different one.

After your Microsoft account has been signed in, you will be able to access your Realms and non-exclusive Marketplace content from other Bedrock versions on your PlayStation. However, any Minecoins you purchased on another version of Bedrock will not be usable on PlayStation. Only Minecraft Tokens can be used in the Minecraft Store on PlayStation. See [What are Minecraft Tokens?](../Minecraft-Marketplace/What-are-Minecraft-Tokens.md) for more info.

## Unlinking Accounts

You can link and unlink accounts at any time. Marketplace purchases made with a Microsoft account stay with that account. If you decide to disconnect your Microsoft account from your PlayStation account, all entitlements to Marketplace content will remain with the Microsoft account and will no longer be accessible on PlayStation. Marketplace purchases also cannot be transferred between accounts.

### How to unlink your Microsoft account in Minecraft on PlayStation

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  Go to the **Account** tab.
4.  Select **Unlink Microsoft Account**.
5.  Read through and check the boxes warning you of the content you miss out on by unlinking your account.
6.  Press **Unlink**.

### What happens when I unlink my Microsoft account from my PSN account?

- Your unspent Tokens and Marketplace purchases made on your current account on PlayStation stay with that PSN Account.
- All your unspent Tokens will still be accessible from your PSN account.  
- You can re-link your account on PlayStation to any Microsoft account that isn't currently connected to a PSN account.
- Unlinking your Microsoft account affects all Minecraft games on your PlayStation console that have used this Microsoft Account.

**You will not:**

- Be able to save purchases made on your PlayStation console to your Microsoft account.
- Be able to access Marketplace content purchased on your PlayStation console when you play on other platforms.
- Be able to play with your friends on other platforms besides PSN.
- Have access to Realms, including currently active Realms subscriptions.
