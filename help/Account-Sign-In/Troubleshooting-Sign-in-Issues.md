If you are unable to sign into Minecraft, follow these steps to help get you back into game.

## Start by Signing into the Xbox App

1.  Download the free Xbox app from your mobile device’s app marketplace. 
2.  Open the Xbox app. 
3.  Sign into the account you want to play with. 
4.  Try signing in again on your Xbox/PC/device.

   
If you are still unable to sign in, view our article for [Information about changing or forgotten passwords](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/reset-a-forgotten-microsoft-account-password-eff4f067-5042-c1a3-fe72-b04d60556c37).

**Important**: when you reach the Xbox account page, it will display your Xbox profile photo, Gamertag, and Microsoft email. Verify that the Microsoft account information shown here is correct. If the account information is incorrect, select the **Sign in with a different account** button. You will then be redirected to a Microsoft sign in page.

Note: If the Microsoft account you sign in with does not have an Xbox profile set up, you will be prompted to set up an Xbox profile and Gamertag.
