**Note**: In many cases where people believe their accounts have been stolen or compromised, it is caused by a sign-in issue.

Here are some steps to take:

- [Change the password](https://www.microsoft.com/account) that’s associated with your account. 
- Sign out of all related Minecraft games, apps and pages, such as games, Minecraft.net, and the launcher. Sign back in with your new password.

If you do not receive password reset emails within a few minutes, cannot sign in, or you are sure that your account was compromised, locate your [transaction ID or gift code ](./Locating-Your-Minecraft-Transaction-ID-for-Account-Support.md)demonstrating account ownership and contact [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support). 

### REPORTING STOLEN ACCOUNTS

You may want to know how to report someone who is re-selling stolen accounts or trying to steal accounts.

If you see someone selling Microsoft accounts, capes, or bragging about stealing them - tell us about it by contacting [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).

You can help in the following ways:

- Don’t buy accounts from third-party sellers, resellers, social media, or from your friends. We can't help you with those (even if you buy it from a "friend") because this violates our Terms of Service.
- If you see something, say something. Let us know if you see people selling accounts on social media or third-party sellers. Take screenshots. We investigate every single claim.
- [Keep your account information safe](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/how-to-help-keep-your-microsoft-account-safe-and-secure-628538c2-7006-33bb-5ef4-c917657362b9). Use two-factor authentication on your email, use strong passwords on all your accounts, and change passwords frequently.
- Don't share passwords with anyone - even if you think they're your online friend.
