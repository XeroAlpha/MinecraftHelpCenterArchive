If you play Minecraft on a computer or link a Microsoft account for access to multiplayer and cross-play features on consoles, all of your Minecraft entitlements are stored under your Microsoft account. If you lose access to your Microsoft account, you lose access to Minecraft. Follow the advice below to get account support from Microsoft and get you back into the game.

## Accessing a Locked Microsoft Account

In many cases where people believe their accounts have been stolen or compromised, it is caused by a sign-in issue or locked account. If you lost access to your account during multiple sign-in attempts, visit the page below and follow the online instructions:

- [Account has been locked](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/account-has-been-locked-805e8b0d-4141-29b2-7b65-df6ff6c9ce27)

## Recovering a Hacked Microsoft Account

If you believe your account was compromised or someone else has gained access to it, Microsoft can help you regain access to the account. Visit the page below and click the Start button to begin the process. You’ll be able to troubleshoot or talk to a Microsoft agent for help.

## Keeping Your Microsoft Account Safe

Microsoft provides several security features that allow you to control access to your account such as two-factor authentication and signing in without a password. You should change your password regularly and never share it online. Visit the page below to learn more about how to add extra security to your Microsoft account.

## Reporting Stolen Microsoft Accounts

If you see someone selling Microsoft accounts, Minecraft capes, or bragging about stealing them - tell us about it by contacting [Minecraft Support](https://aka.ms/Minecraft-Support).

You can help in the following ways:

- Don’t buy accounts from third-party sellers, resellers, social media, or from your friends. We can't help you with those (even if you buy it from a "friend") because this violates our Terms of Service.
- If you see something, say something. Let us know if you see people selling accounts on social media or third-party sellers. Take screenshots. We investigate every single claim.
