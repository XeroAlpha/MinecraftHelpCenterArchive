Some platforms may require a Microsoft account to sign-in and play Minecraft games. You can learn more about [Accounts Required to Play Minecraft](../Set-Up-Your-Account/Accounts-Required-to-Play-Minecraft.md).

## Access Your Microsoft Account

If you need to reset your password for your Microsoft account or update your sign-in details, visit [Get Help with Your Minecraft Account](./Get-Help-Signing-into-Minecraft-with-Your-Microsoft-Account.md).

## Verify Your Account Owns Minecraft

Verify you are signing into the Microsoft account you used to buy Minecraft. Here are two ways you can check the email address you are using for your Microsoft account is correct:

- **Purchase Confirmation Email**: Your purchase confirmation for Minecraft games is sent to the email address on your Microsoft account. Check that you are signing in with the email address where your purchase confirmation was sent.
- **Microsoft Account Order History**: Sign into your [Microsoft account page](https://account.microsoft.com/) and verify that the Minecraft game you want to play is listed in your Order History.

## Sign into the Xbox App

Signing into the Xbox app before signing into Minecraft can sometimes solve sign-in errors if you are certain you are using the correct Microsoft account.

1.  Download the free Xbox app from your mobile device’s app marketplace or get the [Xbox app for Windows PC](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/xbox-app-for-pc).
2.  Open the Xbox app. 
3.  Sign in using the Microsoft account that owns Minecraft. 
4.  Launch Minecraft and try to sign in again on your Xbox/PC/device.

Note: When you reach the Xbox account page, it will display your Xbox profile photo, gamertag, and Microsoft email. Verify that the Microsoft account information shown here is correct. If the account information is incorrect, select the **Sign in with a different account** button. If you need to sign out of Minecraft sign back in, see [Reset Your Microsoft Account Sign-in in Minecraft](./Sign-Out-of-Minecraft.md).
