If you started a Minecraft: Java Edition or Bedrock Edition Realm on a personal computer, you can cancel your recurring subscription through your Microsoft account. When you cancel your Minecraft Realms subscription, your Realm will still be accessible until the renewal date, but payments will no longer be charged automatically. You can restart your Realm at any time.

## Cancel a Realms subscription through your Microsoft account

1.  Visit your [Microsoft account settings](https://account.microsoft.com/) in a web browser.
2.  Sign in with the Microsoft account used to purchase your Minecraft Realms subscription.
3.  Open the **Subscriptions** section from the menu on the left side of the page.
4.  Locate the Realm subscription that needs to be cancelled and select **Manage**.
5.  Select **Cancel subscription**.
6.  Select **Cancel subscription** from the pop-up window.
