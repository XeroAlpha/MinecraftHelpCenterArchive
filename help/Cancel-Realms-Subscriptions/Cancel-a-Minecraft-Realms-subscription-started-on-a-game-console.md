Subscriptions for Minecraft Realms need to be canceled through the same account used to start the subscription. If you started your Realms subscription on an Xbox, Sony PlayStation or Nintendo Switch, you can cancel your subscription on the game platform's website. When you cancel your Minecraft Realms subscription, your Realm will still be accessible until the renewal date, but payments will no longer be charged automatically. You can restart your Realm at any time.
