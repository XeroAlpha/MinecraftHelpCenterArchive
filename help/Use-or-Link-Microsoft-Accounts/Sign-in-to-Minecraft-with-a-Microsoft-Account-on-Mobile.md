If you sign in with a Microsoft account when playing Minecraft on an Android or Apple device, you can enable crossplay and access Marketplace content on other gaming platforms. Here's how to sign in with a Microsoft account:

## Sign in with a Microsoft account on Android or Apple devices

1.  Start Minecraft.
2.  Select **Sign In**.
3.  Select **Sign In** on the new window that opens.
4.  Enter your Microsoft account info or select a pre-saved account.
5.  Select **Letâ€™s Go**.

After you sign in, give your game a few seconds to load your profile and connect to your previously purchased content in the Marketplace.
