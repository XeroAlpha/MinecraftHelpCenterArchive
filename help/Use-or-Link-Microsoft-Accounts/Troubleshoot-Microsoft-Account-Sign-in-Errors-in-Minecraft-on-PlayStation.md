If you [Link Your Microsoft Account to Your PlayStation Network Account in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](./Link-Your-Microsoft-Account-to-Your-PlayStation-Network-Account-in-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition.md) and then receive an error message when signing in, there are two common causes:

- You signed out of your Microsoft account but did not unlink it from your PlayStation Network account.
- The Microsoft account you entered is linked to a different PlayStation Network account.

Here are troubleshooting steps for the two error messages.

## Oops! This account is already connected. Please sign in with your previously connected Microsoft account GAMERTAG.

**Issue**: Your PlayStation Network account is linked to a Microsoft account that is different from the Microsoft account you entered when signing in to Minecraft.

**Solution**: Sign in with or unlink the Microsoft account associated with the gamertag in the error message.

- **Sign in with the associated Microsoft account**:
  - Select **Try Again** and **Sign in with a Microsoft account** or **Sign in for Free**.
  - [Find your Microsoft account email address](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/forgot-microsoft-account-solution) if you don’t know the email address associated with the gamertag.
  - Sign in with the Microsoft account associated with the gamertag in the error message.
- **Unlink and use a different Microsoft account**:
  - Select **Unlink Microsoft account**.
  - Select **Sign in with a Microsoft account** and use a different Microsoft account.

If you unlink your Microsoft account and it has Minecraft Marketplace purchases associated with it, those purchases will no longer be available from your PlayStation Network account.

## Oops! The Microsoft account you are trying to use is already connected to another account for PlayStation Network.

**Issue**: Your Microsoft account is already linked to a different PlayStation Network account.

**Solution**: Use a different Microsoft account that is not connected to a PlayStation Network account, unlink your Microsoft account, or use the PlayStation Network account connected to your Microsoft account.

- **Use a Microsoft account that is not connected with a PlayStation Network account**:
  - Select **Try Again** and **Sign in with a Microsoft account**.
  - Sign in with a new or alternative Microsoft account to your PlayStation network account. See [How to create a new Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/how-to-create-a-new-microsoft-account-a84675c3-3e9e-17cf-2911-3d56b15c0aaf).
- **Unlink the Microsoft account**:
  - Select **Unlink Microsoft account**. This will unlink your Microsoft account from the other      PlayStation Network account.
  - Select **Sign in with a Microsoft account** and sign in with your Microsoft account.
- **Use the PlayStation Network account connected to your Microsoft account**:
  - Close Minecraft.
  - Sign out of the current PlayStation Network account.
  - Sign in to the PlayStation Network account that is connected to your Microsoft account.
