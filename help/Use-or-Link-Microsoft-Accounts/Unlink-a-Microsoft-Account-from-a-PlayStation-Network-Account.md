When playing Minecraft on your PlayStation, you can sign in to a Microsoft account to get access to Realms, cross-platform play, and Marketplace content. Signing in with a Microsoft account links that account with your PlayStation Network account. If you want to use a different Microsoft account on your PlayStation when playing Minecraft, you need to unlink the current Microsoft account first.

## Unlink your Microsoft and PlayStation Network accounts

1.  Start Minecraft on your PlayStation. 
2.  Select **Settings** on the Minecraft launch screen.
3.  Select the** Account** tab.
4.  Select **Unlink Microsoft account**.
5.  Confirm that you want to unlink accounts. 
6.  Select **Unlink**.

If you don't have access to your linked Microsoft account:

- **Try Microsoft support**: The [Find your Microsoft account email address](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/forgot-microsoft-account-solution) article may help you access your Microsoft account. You can then unlink your Microsoft account with the instructions above.
- **Sign in with a different Microsoft account**: If you attempt to sign in with a different Microsoft account, you will see an error that will offer an option to unlink accounts without signing in. See [Troubleshoot Microsoft Account Sign-in Errors in Minecraft on PlayStation](./Troubleshoot-Microsoft-Account-Sign-in-Errors-in-Minecraft-on-PlayStation.md).

## Information about unlinked accounts

- **Purchases stay with the original account:** Your Minecraft Store purchases and unspent Tokens made on your PlayStation account stay on your PlayStation account.
- **All Minecraft games are unlinked:** If you have other Minecraft titles on your PlayStation console, such as Dungeons and Legends, they will also be unlinked from your PlayStation Network Account.
- **Microsoft account benefits end:** If you do not sign in with another Microsoft account after you unlink, you will lose access to Minecraft Store purchases made on other platforms, cross-platform play, and access to Realms.
