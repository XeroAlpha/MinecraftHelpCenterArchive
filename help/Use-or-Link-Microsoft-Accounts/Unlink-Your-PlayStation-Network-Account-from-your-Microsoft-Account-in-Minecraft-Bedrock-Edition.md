When playing Minecraft on your PlayStation, you can sign in to a Microsoft account to get access to Realms, cross-platform play, and Marketplace content. Signing in with a Microsoft account links that account with your PlayStation Network account. If you want to use a different Microsoft account on your PlayStation when playing Minecraft, you need to unlink the current Microsoft account first.

## Unlink your Microsoft and PlayStation Network accounts

1.  Start Minecraft on your PlayStation. 
2.  Select **Settings** on the Minecraft launch screen.
3.  Select the** Account** tab.
4.  Select **Unlink Microsoft account**.
5.  Confirm that you want to unlink accounts. 
6.  Select **Unlink**.

## Information about unlinking accounts

- **Purchases stay with the original account:** Your Minecraft Store purchases and unspent Tokens made on your PlayStation account stay on that account.
- **All Minecraft games are unlinked:** If you have other Minecraft titles, such as Dungeons and Legends, on your PlayStation console, unlinking in Minecraft will also unlink them from your PlayStation Network Account.
- **Microsoft account benefits end:** If you do not sign in with another Microsoft account after you unlink, you lose access to Minecraft Store purchases made on other platforms, cross-platform play, and access to Realms.
