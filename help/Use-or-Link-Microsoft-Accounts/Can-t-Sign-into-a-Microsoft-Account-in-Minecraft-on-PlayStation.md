If you want to play Minecraft with friends on other platforms, you will need to sign in to a Microsoft account.

There are two possible scenarios where you might not be able to sign into your Microsoft account in Minecraft on PlayStationÂ®.

- **Error: The Microsoft account you are trying to sign into is linked to a different PSN account.**
  - [Try linking to a different PSN account](./Link-Your-Microsoft-Account-to-Minecraft-on-PlayStation.md). Each Microsoft account can only be linked to one PSN account and vice versa.
- **Error: You are trying to sign into the wrong Microsoft account**.
  - If you are trying to sign into the wrong Microsoft account, a message will appear telling you the account your PSN is connected to. Sign in to that account. You can then [unlink and use a different account](./How-to-Unlink-Your-PlayStation-Network-Account-from-your-Microsoft-Account-in-Minecraft.md) if you wish.

See [Link Your Microsoft Account to Minecraft on PlayStation](./Link-Your-Microsoft-Account-to-Minecraft-on-PlayStation.md) for information about account linking.
