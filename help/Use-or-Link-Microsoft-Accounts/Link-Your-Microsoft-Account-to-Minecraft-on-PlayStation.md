If you want to play with friends on different platforms or join Realms on Minecraft for PlayStation, you will need to link a Microsoft account to your PlayStation Network (PSN) account. 

## Link your Microsoft account on your PlayStation

1.  Launch Minecraft on your PlayStation.
2.  Select **Sign in with a Microsoft account** on the title screen.
3.  Visit the [code redemption site on a browser](https://login.live.com/oauth20_remoteconnect.srf).
4.  Input the code that your game is displaying.
5.  Sign in to the Microsoft account you want associated with your PlayStation account.

## Information about account linking

- **Account Linking Limit:** You can link one Microsoft account with your PlayStation Network account. To change the linked Microsoft account, see [How to Unlink Your PlayStation Network Account from your Microsoft Account in Minecraft](./How-to-Unlink-Your-PlayStation-Network-Account-from-your-Microsoft-Account-in-Minecraft.md).
- **Marketplace Purchase Access:** Linking to a Microsoft account gives you access to non-exclusive Marketplace content on your PlayStation that you purchased using your Microsoft account on other game platforms. However, if you want to buy new items on your PlayStation, you need to use [Minecraft Tokens](../Buying-Marketplace-Content/What-are-Minecraft-Tokens.md) in the Minecraft Store on PlayStation. 
- **Cross-platform Play:** Linking a Microsoft account allows you to play multiplayer games in Minecraft Realms with players on other gaming platforms. See [Create or Join Realms](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/26104084764557) for more information.
